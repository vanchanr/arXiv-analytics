    "abstract": "Training the future cybersecurity workforce to respond to emerging threats requires introduction of novel educational interventions into the cybersecurity curriculum. To be effective, these interventions have to incorporate trending knowledge from cybersecurity and other related domains while allowing for experiential learning through hands-on experimentation. To date, the traditional interdisciplinary approach for cybersecurity training has infused political science, law, economics or linguistics knowledge into the cybersecurity curriculum, allowing for limited experimentation. Cybersecurity students were left with little opportunity to acquire knowledge, skills, and abilities in domains outside of these. Also, students in outside majors had no options to get into cybersecurity. With this in mind, we developed an interdisciplinary course for experiential learning in the fields of cybersecurity and interaction design. The inaugural course teaches students from cybersecurity, user interaction design, and visual design the principles of designing for secure use - or secure design - and allows them to apply them for prototyping of Internet-of-Things (IoT) products for smart homes. This paper elaborates on the concepts of secure design and how our approach enhances the training of the future cybersecurity workforce.",

But with great fears come great opportunities for both the good and the evil, and a myriad of bad deals. This paper discusses ten issues in cybersecurity that hopefully will make it easier for practitioners to ask detailed questions about what they want from an AI system in their cybersecurity operations. We draw on the state of the art to provide factual arguments for a discussion on well-established AI in cybersecurity issues, including the current scope of AI and its application to cybersecurity, the impact of privacy concerns on the cybersecurity data that can be collected and shared externally to the organization, how an AI decision can be explained to the person running the operations center, and the implications of the adversarial nature of cybersecurity in the learning techniques. We then discuss the use of AI by attackers on a level playing field including several issues in an AI battlefield, and an AI perspective on the old cat-and-mouse game including how the adversary may assess your AI power.",

However, many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) consider such services not to be affordable. We explore an alternative do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to bringing cybersecurity to SMBs. Our method and tool, CYSEC, implements the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to guide and motivate SMBs to adopt good cybersecurity practices. CYSEC uses assessment questions and recommendations to communicate cybersecurity knowledge to the end user SMBs and encourage self-motivated change. In this paper, the operationalisation of SDT in CYSEC is presented and the results of a multi-case study shown that offer insight into how SMBs adopted cybersecurity practices with CYSEC. Effective automated cybersecurity communication depended on the SMB's hands-on skills, tools adaptedness, and the users' willingness to documenting confidential information. The SMBs wanted to learn in simple, incremental steps, allowing them to understand what they do. An SMB's motivation to improve security depended on the fitness of assessment questions and recommendations with the SMB's business model and IT infrastructure. The results of this study indicate that automated counselling can help many SMBs in security adoption.",

    "abstract": "Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) have become the weak spot of our economy for cyber attacks. These companies are large in number and often do not have the controls in place to prevent successful attacks, respectively are not prepared to systematically manage their cybersecurity capabilities. One of the reasons for why many SME do not adopt cybersecurity is that developers of cybersecurity solutions understand little the SME context and the requirements for successful use of these solutions. We elicit requirements by studying how cybersecurity experts provide advice to SME. The experts recommendations offer insights into what important capabilities of the solution are and how these capabilities ought to be used for mitigating cybersecurity threats. The adoption of a recommendation hints at a correct match of the solution, hence successful consideration of requirements. Abandoned recommendations point to a misalignment that can be used as a source to inquire missed requirements. Re-occurrence of adoption or abandonment decisions corroborate the presence of requirements. This poster describes the challenges of SME regarding cybersecurity and introduces our proposed approach to elicit requirements for cybersecurity solutions. The poster describes CYSEC, our tool used to capture cybersecurity advice and help to scale cybersecurity requirements elicitation to a large number of participating SME. We conclude by outlining the planned research to develop and validate CYSEC.",

A next generation of bio-inspired cybersecurity research is emerging, but progress is hindered by the lack of a framework for mapping biological security systems to their cyber analogies.

However, state-of-the-art IOCs detection systems rely heavily on hand-crafted features with expert knowledge of cybersecurity, and require large-scale manually annotated corpora to train an IOC classifier. In this paper, we propose using an end-to-end neural-based sequence labelling model to identify IOCs automatically from cybersecurity articles without expert knowledge of cybersecurity. By using a multi-head self-attention module and contextual features, we find that the proposed model is capable of gathering contextual information from texts of cybersecurity articles and performs better in the task of IOC identification. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms other sequence labelling models, achieving the average F1-score of 89.0% on English cybersecurity article test set, and approximately the average F1-score of 81.8% on Chinese test set.",

In spring 2016, we interviewed twenty-six students to uncover their understandings and misconceptions about these concepts. In fall 2016, we generated our first assessment tool--a draft Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI), comprising approximately thirty multiple-choice questions. Each question targets a concept; incorrect answers are based on observed misconceptions from the interviews. This year we are validating the draft CCI using cognitive interviews, expert reviews, and psychometric testing. In this paper, we highlight our progress to date in developing the CCI. The CATS project provides infrastructure for a rigorous evidence-based improvement of cybersecurity education. The CCI permits comparisons of different instructional methods by assessing how well students learned the core concepts of the field (especially adversarial thinking), where instructional methods refer to how material is taught (e.g., lab-based, case-studies, collaborative, competitions, gaming). Specifically, the CCI is a tool that will enable researchers to scientifically quantify and measure the effect of their approaches to, and interventions in, cybersecurity education.",

A cybersecurity knowledge graph can be paramount in aiding a security analyst to detect cyber threats because it stores a vast range of cyber threat information in the form of semantic triples which can be queried. A semantic triple contains two cybersecurity entities with a relationship between them. In this work, we propose a system to create semantic triples over cybersecurity text, using deep learning approaches to extract possible relationships. We use the set of semantic triples generated through our system to assert in a cybersecurity knowledge graph. Security Analysts can retrieve this data from the knowledge graph, and use this information to form a decision about a cyber-attack.",

These standards of experimentation enable the development of metrics, create assurance of experimental soundness, and aid in the generalizability of results. To facilitate such empirical experimentation in cybersecurity, we propose the adaptation of camouflaged cyber simulations as an approach for cybersecurity research.

We explain the decisions we made and discuss the consequences of those decisions, highlighting what worked well and what might have gone better. The CATS Project is creating and validating two concept inventories---conceptual tests of understanding---that can be used to measure the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching and learning cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity Concept Inventory (CCI) is for students who have recently completed any first course in cybersecurity; the Cybersecurity Curriculum Assessment (CCA) is for students who have recently completed an undergraduate major or track in cybersecurity. Each assessment tool comprises 25 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) of various difficulties that target the same five core concepts, but the CCA assumes greater technical background. Key steps include defining project scope, identifying the core concepts, uncovering student misconceptions, creating scenarios, drafting question stems, developing distractor answer choices, generating educational materials, performing expert reviews, recruiting student subjects, organizing workshops, building community acceptance, forming a team and nurturing collaboration, adopting tools, and obtaining and using funding. Creating effective MCQs is difficult and time-consuming, and cybersecurity presents special challenges. Because cybersecurity issues are often subtle, where the adversarial model and details matter greatly, it is challenging to construct MCQs for which there is exactly one best but non-obvious answer. We hope that our experiences and lessons learned may help others create more effective concept inventories and assessments in STEM.",

Whilst a plethora of Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems have been reported in the literature, there is a lack of a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature from an architectural perspective. Objective: This paper reports a systematic review aimed at identifying the most frequently reported quality attributes and architectural tactics for Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems. Method: We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method for reviewing 74 primary studies selected using well-defined criteria. Results: Our findings are twofold: (i) identification of 12 most frequently reported quality attributes and the justification for their significance for Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems; and (ii) identification and codification of 17 architectural tactics for addressing the quality attributes that are commonly associated with Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic systems. The identified tactics include six performance tactics, four accuracy tactics, two scalability tactics, three reliability tactics, and one security and usability tactic each. Conclusion: Our findings have revealed that (a) despite the significance of interoperability, modifiability, adaptability, generality, stealthiness, and privacy assurance, these quality attributes lack explicit architectural support in the literature (b) empirical investigation is required to evaluate the impact of codified architectural tactics (c) a good deal of research effort should be invested to explore the trade-offs and dependencies among the identified tactics and (d) there is a general lack of effective collaboration between academia and industry for supporting the field of Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems.",

    "abstract": "As machine learning and cybersecurity continue to explode in the context of the digital ecosystem, the complexity of cybersecurity data combined with complicated and evasive machine learning algorithms leads to vast difficulties in designing an end to end system for intelligent, automatic anomaly classification. On the other hand, traditional systems use elementary statistics techniques and are often inaccurate, leading to weak centralized data analysis platforms. In this paper, we propose a novel system that addresses these two problems, titled CAMLPAD, for Cybersecurity Autonomous Machine Learning Platform for Anomaly Detection. The CAMLPAD systems streamlined, holistic approach begins with retrieving a multitude of different species of cybersecurity data in real time using elasticsearch, then running several machine learning algorithms, namely Isolation Forest, Histogram Based Outlier Score (HBOS), Cluster Based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF), and K Means Clustering, to process the data. Next, the calculated anomalies are visualized using Kibana and are assigned an outlier score, which serves as an indicator for whether an alert should be sent to the system administrator that there are potential anomalies in the network. After comprehensive testing of our platform in a simulated environment, the CAMLPAD system achieved an adjusted rand score of 95 percent, exhibiting the reliable accuracy and precision of the system. All in all, the CAMLPAD system provides an accurate, streamlined approach to real time cybersecurity anomaly detection, delivering a novel solution that has the potential to revolutionize the cybersecurity sector.",

The tasks feature diverse assignments, such as exploiting websites, cracking passwords, and breaching unsecured networks. However, it is unclear how the skills practiced by these challenges match formal cybersecurity curricula defined by security experts. We explain the significance of Capture the Flag challenges in cybersecurity training and analyze their 15,963 textual solutions collected since 2012. Based on keywords in the solutions, we map them to well-established ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines to understand which skills the challenges teach. We study the distribution of cybersecurity topics, their variance in different challenge formats, and their development over the past years. The analysis showed the prominence of technical knowledge about cryptography and network security, but human aspects, such as social engineering and cybersecurity awareness, are neglected. We discuss the implications of these results and relate them to contemporary literature. Our results indicate that future Capture the Flag challenges should include non-technical aspects to address the current advanced cyber threats and attract a broader audience to cybersecurity.",

In this paper, we analyze some real data collected by CAIDA's network telescope during the month of March 2013. We propose to formalize the concept of cybersecurity posture from the perspectives of three kinds of time series: the number of victims (i.e., telescope IP addresses that are attacked), the number of attackers that are observed by the telescope, and the number of attacks that are observed by the telescope. Characterizing cybersecurity posture therefore becomes investigating the phenomena and statistical properties exhibited by these time series, and explaining their cybersecurity meanings. For example, we propose the concept of {\\em sweep-time}, and show that sweep-time should be modeled by stochastic process, rather than random variable. We report that the number of attackers (and attacks) from a certain country dominates the total number of attackers (and attacks) that are observed by the telescope. We also show that substantially smaller network telescopes might not be as useful as a large telescope.",

Therefore, we decided to focus on a diagnostic assessment of participants entering the games. We assume that information about the players' knowledge, skills, and experience enables tutors or learning environments to suitably assist participants with game challenges and maximize learning in their virtual adventure. In this paper, we present a pioneering experiment examining the predictive value of a short quiz and self-assessment for identifying learners' readiness before playing a cybersecurity game. We hypothesized that these predictors would model players' performance. A linear regression analysis showed that the game performance can be accurately predicted by well-designed prerequisite testing, but not by self-assessment. At the same time, we identified major challenges related to the design of pretests for cybersecurity games: calibrating test questions with respect to the skills relevant for the game, minimizing the quiz's length while maximizing its informative value, and embedding the pretest in the game. Our results are relevant for educational researchers and cybersecurity instructors of students at all learning levels.",

In this paper, we propose using a neural-based sequence labelling model to identify IOCs automatically from reports on cybersecurity without expert knowledge of cybersecurity. Our work is the first to apply an end-to-end sequence labelling to the task in IOCs identification. By using an attention mechanism and several token spelling features, we find that the proposed model is capable of identifying the low frequency IOCs from long sentences contained in cybersecurity reports. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms other sequence labelling models, achieving over 88% average F1-score.",

Our research aim is to examine how young players approach using cybersecurity tools by interacting with the professional game. A preliminary analysis of the game session showed several challenges that the workshop participants faced. Nevertheless, they reported learning about security tools and exploits, and 61% of them reported wanting to learn more about cybersecurity after the workshop. Our results support the notion that young learners should be allowed more hands-on experience with security topics, both in formal education and informal extracurricular events.",

Although the cybersecurity scholarship had an initial promise to be the primus inter pares among these emerging fields, the main thrust of this new methodological innovation came through the digital conflict studies sub-field. By integrating Internet and social media research tools and questions into its core topics of sub-national violence, terrorism and radical mobilization, digital conflict studies has recently succeeded in addressing some of the data validity and methodology problems faced by the cybersecurity scholarship. This article begins by briefly reviewing some of the persistent data and method-oriented hurdles faced by the cybersecurity scholarship. Then, it moves onto a more detailed account of how digital conflict studies have been addressing some of these deadlocks by focusing individually on the literature on onset, mobilization, targeting, intensity/duration and termination phases of conflicts. Ultimately, the article concludes with the suggestion that the cybersecurity scholarship could move past its own deadlocks by building more granular and dedicated research datasets and establishing mechanisms to share event data with the scientific community.",

We realize these ideas in a game that emulates the decision making of workers in a research lab. Through a human-subject study, we find that whereas individual sanctions are more effective than group sanctions in achieving compliance and less detrimental on the ability of users to complete their work, individual sanctions offer significantly lower resilience especially for organizations comprising risk seekers.

From 2010 to 2019, a total of 1,748 papers were published at these conferences, and 71 of them focus on cybersecurity education. The papers discuss courses, tools, exercises, and teaching approaches. For each paper, we map the covered topics, teaching context, evaluation methods, impact, and the community of authors. We discovered that the technical topic areas are evenly covered (the most prominent being secure programming, network security, and offensive security), and human aspects, such as privacy and social engineering, are present as well. The interventions described in SIGCSE and ITiCSE papers predominantly focus on tertiary education in the USA. The subsequent evaluation mostly consists of collecting students' subjective perceptions via questionnaires. However, less than a third of the papers provide supplementary materials for other educators, and none of the authors published their dataset.

A multitude of model curricula and recommendations have been presented and discussed in international fora in recent years, with varying levels of impact on education, policy and practice. This paper address three key questions: i) what is taught and what should be taught for cybersecurity to general computer science students; ii) should cybersecurity be taught stand-alone or in an integrated manner to general computer science students; and iii) can accreditation by national professional, statutory and regulatory bodies enhance the provision of cybersecurity within a body's jurisdiction? Evaluating how cybersecurity is taught in all aspects of computer science is clearly a task of considerable size, one that is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead a case study-based research approach -- primarily focusing on the UK -- has been adopted to evaluate the evidence of the teaching of cybersecurity within general computer science to university-level students. Thus, in the context of widespread international computer science/engineering curriculum reform, what does this need to embed cybersecurity knowledge and skills mean more generally for institutions and educators, and how can we teach this subject more effectively? Through this UK case study, and by contrasting with related initiatives in the US, we demonstrate the positive effect that national accreditation requirements can have, and offer some recommendations both for future research and curriculum developments.",

A single failure of a superintelligent system may cause a catastrophic event without a chance for recovery. The goal of cybersecurity is to reduce the number of successful attacks on the system; the goal of AI Safety is to make sure zero attacks succeed in bypassing the safety mechanisms. Unfortunately, such a level of performance is unachievable. Every security system will eventually fail; there is no such thing as a 100% secure system.",

In contrast to perimeter-based security, mission-centric cybersecurity provides awareness of how attacks can influence mission success and therefore focuses resources for mitigating vulnerabilities and protecting critical assets. This is strategic as opposed to tactical perimeter-based cybersecurity. We propose MISSION AWARE, which assists in the identification of parts of a system that destabilize the overall mission of the system if compromised. MSSION AWARE starts with a structured elicitation process that leads to hazards analysis. It employs hierarchical modeling methods to capture mission requirements, admissible functional behaviors, and system architectures. It then generates evidence---attacks applicable to elements that directly correlate with mission success. Finally, MISSION AWARE traces evidence back to mission requirements to determine the evidence with the highest impact relative to mission objectives.",

Moreover, the open day raised awareness about cybersecurity and research and development in this field at our faculty.

    "abstract": "In recent years the cybersecurity policy debate in Washington has been dominated by calls for greater information sharing within the private sector, and between the private sector and the federal government. The passage of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) (signed into law under the Cybersecurity Act of 2015) underscored federal efforts to collect information from the private sector, and assuaged some concerns regarding private sector liability in sharing activities. However, the law lacked specificity on how continued federal efforts would work with existing information sharing networks, and failed to address other challenges associated with sharing including trust building, privacy and propriety interests, reciprocation, and quality control. This paper aims to bring granularity to implementations of information sharing initiatives by creating a taxonomy of the governance and policy models within each of these organizations. The research shows how this diverse ecosystem of sharing models work together and separately, and the impact governance and policy have on key components critical to sharing infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "The prominence and use of the concept of cyber risk has been rising in recent years. This paper presents empirical investigations focused on two important and distinct groups within the broad community of cyber-defense professionals and researchers: (1) cyber practitioners and (2) developers of cyber ontologies. The key finding of this work is that the ways the concept of cyber risk is treated by practitioners of cybersecurity is largely inconsistent with definitions of cyber risk commonly offered in the literature. Contrary to commonly cited definitions of cyber risk, concepts such as the likelihood of an event and the extent of its impact are not used by cybersecurity practitioners. This is also the case for use of these concepts in the current generation of cybersecurity ontologies. Instead, terms and concepts reflective of the adversarial nature of cyber defense appear to take the most prominent roles. This research offers the first quantitative empirical evidence that rejection of traditional concepts of cyber risk by cybersecurity professionals is indeed observed in real-world practice.",

    "abstract": "The multilingual nature of the Internet increases complications in the cybersecurity community's ongoing efforts to strategically mine threat intelligence from OSINT data on the web. OSINT sources such as social media, blogs, and dark web vulnerability markets exist in diverse languages and hinder security analysts, who are unable to draw conclusions from intelligence in languages they don't understand. Although third party translation engines are growing stronger, they are unsuited for private security environments. First, sensitive intelligence is not a permitted input to third party engines due to privacy and confidentiality policies. In addition, third party engines produce generalized translations that tend to lack exclusive cybersecurity terminology. In this paper, we address these issues and describe our system that enables threat intelligence understanding across unfamiliar languages. We create a neural network based system that takes in cybersecurity data in a different language and outputs the respective English translation. The English translation can then be understood by an analyst, and can also serve as input to an AI based cyber-defense system that can take mitigative action. As a proof of concept, we have created a pipeline which takes Russian threats and generates its corresponding English, RDF, and vectorized representations. Our network optimizes translations on specifically, cybersecurity data.",

Even with advanced monitoring, sophisticated attackers can spend as many as 146 days in a system before being detected. This paper describes a novel, cognitive framework that assists a security analyst by exploiting the power of semantically rich knowledge representation and reasoning with machine learning techniques. Our Cognitive Cybersecurity system ingests information from textual sources, and various agents representing host and network-based sensors, and represents this information in a knowledge graph. This graph uses terms from an extended version of the Unified Cybersecurity Ontology. The system reasons over the knowledge graph to derive better actionable intelligence to security administrators, thus decreasing their cognitive load and increasing their confidence in the system. We have developed a proof of concept framework for our approach and demonstrate its capabilities using a custom-built ransomware instance that is similar to WannaCry.",

Risk analysis is an essential methodology for cybersecurity as it allows organisations to deal with the cyber threats potentially affecting them, prioritise the defence of their assets and decide what security controls should be implemented. Many risk analysis methods are present in cybersecurity models, compliance frameworks and international standards. However, most of them employ risk matrices, which suffer shortcomings that may lead to suboptimal resource allocations. We propose a comprehensive framework for cybersecurity risk analysis, covering the presence of both adversarial and non-intentional threats and the use of insurance as part of the security portfolio.

    "abstract": "Software products are rarely developed from scratch and vulnerabilities in such products might reside in parts that are either open source software or provided by another organization. Hence, the total cybersecurity of a product often depends on cooperation, explicit or implicit, between several organizations. We study the attitudes and practices of companies in software ecosystems towards sharing vulnerability information. Furthermore, we compare these practices to contemporary cybersecurity recommendations. This is performed through a questionnaire-based qualitative survey. The questionnaire is divided into two parts: the providers' perspective and the acquirers' perspective. The results show that companies are willing to share information with each other regarding vulnerabilities. Sharing is not considered to be harmful neither to the cybersecurity nor their business, even though a majority of the respondents consider vulnerability information sensitive. However, the companies, despite being open to sharing, are less inclined to proactively sharing vulnerability information. Furthermore, the providers do not perceive that there is a large interest in vulnerability information from their customers. Hence, the companies' overall attitude to sharing vulnerability information is passive but open. In contrast, contemporary cybersecurity guidelines recommend active disclosure and sharing among actors in an ecosystem.",

It, however, also contains the inherent risk of being used for purposes that are not intended for, raging from small non-authorized customizations to the possibility of full-scale cyberattacks that affect several vehicles to whole fleets and vital systems such as steering and engine control. To prevent such conditions and mitigate cybersecurity risks from affecting the safety of road traffic, testing cybersecurity must be adopted into automotive testing at a large scale. Currently, the manual penetration testing processes cannot uphold the increasing demand due to time and cost to test complex systems. We propose an approach for an architecture that (semi-)automates automotive cybersecurity test, allowing for more economic testing and therefore keeping up to the rising demand induced by new vehicle functions as well as the development towards connected and autonomous vehicles.",

Most of these techniques utilize supervised learning algorithms that rely on training the algorithm to classify incoming data into different categories, using data encountered in the relevant domain. A critical vulnerability of these algorithms is that they are susceptible to adversarial attacks where a malicious entity called an adversary deliberately alters the training data to misguide the learning algorithm into making classification errors. Adversarial attacks could render the learning algorithm unsuitable to use and leave critical systems vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. Our paper provides a detailed survey of the state-of-the-art techniques that are used to make a machine learning algorithm robust against adversarial attacks using the computational framework of game theory. We also discuss open problems and challenges and possible directions for further research that would make deep machine learning-based systems more robust and reliable for cybersecurity tasks.",

    "abstract": "As cybercriminals scale up their operations to increase their profits or inflict greater harm, we argue that there is an equal need to respond to their threats by scaling up cybersecurity. To achieve this goal, we have to develop a co-productive approach towards data collection and sharing by overcoming the cybersecurity data sharing paradox. This is where we all agree on the definition of the problem and end goal (improving cybersecurity and getting rid of cybercrime), but we disagree about how to achieve it and fail to work together efficiently. At the core of this paradox is the observation that public interests differ from private interests. As a result, industry and law enforcement take different approaches to the cybersecurity problem as they seek to resolve incidents in their own interests, which manifests in different data sharing practices between both and also other interested parties, such as cybersecurity researchers. The big question we ask is can these interests be reconciled to develop an interdisciplinary approach towards co-operation and sharing data. In essence, all three will have to co-own the problem in order to co-produce a solution. We argue that a few operational models with good practices exist that provide guides to a possible solution, especially multiple third-party ownership organisations which consolidate, anonymise and analyse data. To take this forward, we suggest the practical solution of organising co-productive data collection on a sectoral basis, but acknowledge that common standards for data collection will also have to be developed and agreed upon. We propose an initial set of best practices for building collaborations and sharing data and argue that these best practices need to be developed and standardised in order to mitigate the paradox.",

We study a particular kind of cybersecurity dynamics caused by the interactions between preventive and reactive defenses (e.g., filtering and malware detection) against push- and pull-based cyber attacks (e.g., malware spreading and \"drive-by download\" attacks). The dynamics was previously shown to be globally stable in a {\\em special} regime of the parameter universe, but little is known beyond this special regime. In this paper, we resolve an open problem in this domain by proving that the dynamics is globally stable in the {\\em entire} parameter universe (i.e., the dynamics always converges to a unique equilibrium). We discuss the cybersecurity meanings and implications of this theoretic result. We also prove that the dynamics converges {\\em exponentially} to the equilibrium except for a special parameter regime, in which case the dynamics converges {\\em polynomially}. Since it is often difficult to compute the equilibrium, we propose new bounds of the equilibrium and numerically show that these bounds are tighter than those proposed in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity attacks are a major and increasing burden to economic and social systems globally. Here we analyze the principles of security in different domains and demonstrate an architectural flaw in current cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is inherently weak because it is missing the ability to defend the overall system instead of individual computers. The current architecture enables all nodes in the computer network to communicate transparently with one another, so security would require protecting every computer in the network from all possible attacks. In contrast, other systems depend on system-wide protections. In providing conventional security, police patrol neighborhoods and the military secures borders, rather than defending each individual household. Likewise, in biology, the immune system provides security against viruses and bacteria using primarily action at the skin, membranes, and blood, rather than requiring each cell to defend itself. We propose applying these same principles to address the cybersecurity challenge. This will require: (a) Enabling pervasive distribution of self-propagating securityware and creating a developer community for such securityware, and (b) Modifying the protocols of internet routers to accommodate adaptive security software that would regulate internet traffic. The analysis of the immune system architecture provides many other principles that should be applied to cybersecurity. Among these principles is a careful interplay of detection and action that includes evolutionary improvement. However, achieving significant security gains by applying these principles depends strongly on remedying the underlying architectural limitations.",

Overall, the actions taken by governments to address privacy risks are mainly in the form of regulations or voluntary guidelines.

Tens of millions of people trust their lives every day to such systems, based on formal proofs rather than ``we haven't found a bug'' (yet!). Why is ``we haven't found a bug'' an acceptable basis for systems trusted with hundreds of millions of people's personal data? This paper looks at some of the issues in CyberSecurity, and the extent to which formal methods, ranging from ``fully verified'' to better tool support, could help. Alas The Royal Society (2016) only recommended formal methods in the limited context of ``safety critical applications'': we suggest this is too limited.",

This research article focuses on this topic and proposes a high-level programme for cybersecurity education and awareness to be used when targeting Small-to-Medium-sized Enterprises/Businesses (SMEs/SMBs) at a city-level. We ground this programme in existing research as well as unique insight into an ongoing city-based project with similar aims. Findings: We find that whilst literature can be informative at guiding education and awareness programmes, it may not always reach real-world programmes. On the other hand, existing programmes, such as the one we explored, have great potential but there can also be room for improvement. Knowledge from each of these areas can, and should, be combined to the benefit of the academic and practitioner communities. Originality/value: The study contributes to current research through the outline of a high-level programme for cybersecurity education and awareness targeting SMEs/SMBs. Through this research, we engage in a reflection of literature in this space, and present insights into the advances and challenges faced by an on-going programme. These analyses allow us to craft a proposal for a core programme that can assist in improving the security education, awareness and training that targets SMEs/SMBs.",

While an increasingly fewer number of people are trying or willing to take formal security training, online sources including news, security blogs, and websites are continuously making security knowledge more accessible. Analysis of cybersecurity texts can provide insights into the trending topics and identify current security issues as well as how cyber attacks evolve over time. These in turn can support researchers and practitioners in predicting and preparing for these attacks. Comparing different sources may facilitate the learning process for normal users by persisting the security knowledge gained from different cybersecurity context. Prior studies neither systematically analysed the wide-range of digital sources nor provided any standardisation in analysing the trending topics from recent security texts. Although LDA has been widely adopted in topic generation, its generated topics cannot cover the cybersecurity concepts completely and considerably overlap. To address this issue, we propose a semi-automated classification method to generate comprehensive security categories instead of LDA-generated topics. We further compare the identified 16 security categories across different sources based on their popularity and impact. We have revealed several surprising findings. (1) The impact reflected from cyber-security texts strongly correlates with the monetary loss caused by cybercrimes. (2) For most categories, security blogs share the largest popularity and largest absolute/relative impact over time. (3) Websites deliver security information without caring about timeliness much, where one third of the articles do not specify the date and the rest have a time lag in posting emerging security issues.",

    "abstract": "Small and medium sized enterprises are considered an essential part of the EU economy, however, highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. SMEs have specific characteristics which separate them from large companies and influence their adoption of good cybersecurity practices. To mitigate the SMEs cybersecurity adoption issues and raise their awareness of cyber threats, we have designed a self paced security assessment and capability improvement method, CYSEC. CYSEC is a security awareness and training method that utilises self reporting questionnaires to collect companies information about cybersecurity awareness, practices, and vulnerabilities to generate automated recommendations for counselling. However, confidentiality concerns about cybersecurity information have an impact on companies willingness to share their information. Security information sharing decreases the risk of incidents and increases users self efficacy in security awareness programs. This paper presents the results of semi structured interviews with seven chief information security officers of SMEs to evaluate the impact of online consent communication on motivation for information sharing. The results were analysed in respect of the Self Determination Theory. The findings demonstrate that online consent with multiple options for indicating a suitable level of agreement improved motivation for information sharing. This allows many SMEs to participate in security information sharing activities and supports security experts to have a better overview of common vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "In concept, a smart charging management system (SCMS) optimizes the charging of plug-in vehicles (PEVs) and provides various grid services including voltage control, frequency regulation, peak shaving, renewable energy integration support, spinning reserve, and emergency demand response. These functionalities largely depend upon data collected from various entities such as PEVs, electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), service providers, and utilities. SCMS can be susceptible to both cyber and physical threats (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack, data intrigued attack, denial of charging, physical-attack) due to interactions of and interdependencies between cyber and physical components. Cyber-physical threats through highly connected malware vectors raise various concerns including public safety hazards to vehicle operators and those in the immediate vicinity as well as disruptions to electric grid operations. This paper describes the concept of SCMS and provides a comprehensive review of the cybersecurity aspects of EVSEs and SCMSs with their possible impacts on the power grid and society. It also contributes to the development of cybersecurity measures to the SCMSs. Various functions of SCMS are reviewed in detail including peak shaving, demand charge reduction, frequency regulation, spinning reserve, renewable integration support, distribution congestion management, reactive power compensation, and emergency demand response with unidirectional PEVs charging. Also, a critical literature survey on current practices of SCMS cybersecurity is provided to explore major impacts and challenges of cyber-physical attacks and to identify research gaps and vulnerabilities in currently available SCMSs technologies.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of network vigilantism is autonomously attributed to how anomalies and obscure activities from adversaries can be tracked in realtime. Needless to say, in today dynamic, virtualized, and complex network environments, it has become undeniably necessary for network administrators, analysts as well as engineers to practice network vigilantism, on traffic as well as other network events in real-time. The reason is to understand the exact security posture of an organization network environment at any given time. This is driven by the fact that modern network environments do, not only present new opportunities to organizations but also a different set of new and complex cybersecurity challenges that need to be resolved daily. The growing size, scope, complexity, and volume of networked devices in our modern network environments also makes it hard even for the most experienced network administrators to independently provide the breadth and depth of knowledge needed to oversee or diagnose complex network problems. Besides, with the growing number of Cyber Security Threats in the world today, many organizations have been forced to change the way they plan, develop and implement cybersecurity strategies as a way to reinforce their ability to respond to cybersecurity incidents. This paper, therefore, examines the relevance of RealTime Monitoring (RTM) as a supplementary security component of vigilantism in modern network environments, more especially for proper planning, preparedness, and mitigation in case of a cybersecurity incident. Additionally, this paper also investigates some of the key issues and challenges surrounding the implementation of RTM for security vigilantism in our modern network environments.",

At face value, these new programs may not appear controversial, but developing their curriculum requires answering a complex ethical question: Should programs teach hacking to their students? Even though there are different types of hackers, media reports of cybersecurity incidents tend to reserve the \"hacker\" label for cyber criminals, which overlooks the value in hacking (and, by extension, teaching students to hack). This article examines the full spectrum of hacking behavior, as well as arguments for and against including hacking in education programs, and recommends that hacking skills be considered an essential component of an education and practice in software quality assurance.",

Throughout its history, the Navy has shown the ability of innovation (in policy, process, and technology) to change the game when our security is on the line. We believe the Navy is capable of dramatically impacting not only the U.S. capabilities in cyber conflict and information operations, but also in cyber defense and information assurance, as well as cybersecurity for our society. While cyber risk management is challenging, the transition from DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) to the Risk Management Framework (RMF) has the potential to harmonize our cybersecurity efforts with our need (and demonstrated ability to provide) for game-changing strategies, tactics, and technologies.

Analyzing 1,479 simulation runs, we compared the performances of a group of experienced professionals with those of an inexperienced control group. Experienced subjects did not understand the mechanisms of delays any better than inexperienced subjects; however, experienced subjects were better able to learn the need for proactive decision-making through an iterative process. Both groups exhibited similar errors when dealing with the uncertainty of cyber incidents. Our findings highlight the importance of training for decision-makers with a focus on systems thinking skills, and lay the groundwork for future research on uncovering mental biases about the complexities of cybersecurity.",

    "abstract": "Word embedding is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that automatically maps words from a vocabulary to vectors of real numbers in an embedding space. It has been widely used in recent years to boost the performance of a vari-ety of NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, Syntac-tic Parsing and Sentiment Analysis. Classic word embedding methods such as Word2Vec and GloVe work well when they are given a large text corpus. When the input texts are sparse as in many specialized domains (e.g., cybersecurity), these methods often fail to produce high-quality vectors. In this pa-per, we describe a novel method to train domain-specificword embeddings from sparse texts. In addition to domain texts, our method also leverages diverse types of domain knowledge such as domain vocabulary and semantic relations. Specifi-cally, we first propose a general framework to encode diverse types of domain knowledge as text annotations. Then we de-velop a novel Word Annotation Embedding (WAE) algorithm to incorporate diverse types of text annotations in word em-bedding. We have evaluated our method on two cybersecurity text corpora: a malware description corpus and a Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) corpus. Our evaluation re-sults have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in learning domain-specific word embeddings.",

Advocates and engineers have recently proposed using defensive deception as a means to leverage the information asymmetry typically enjoyed by attackers as a tool for defenders. The term deception, however, has been employed broadly and with a variety of meanings. In this paper, we survey 24 articles from 2008-2018 that use game theory to model defensive deception for cybersecurity and privacy. Then we propose a taxonomy that defines six types of deception: perturbation, moving target defense, obfuscation, mixing, honey-x, and attacker engagement. These types are delineated by their information structures, agents, actions, and duration: precisely concepts captured by game theory. Our aims are to rigorously define types of defensive deception, to capture a snapshot of the state of the literature, to provide a menu of models which can be used for applied research, and to identify promising areas for future work. Our taxonomy provides a systematic foundation for understanding different types of defensive deception commonly encountered in cybersecurity and privacy.",

Social engineering cyberattacks are a kind of psychological attack that exploits weaknesses in human cognitive functions. Adequate defense against social engineering cyberattacks requires a deeper understanding of what aspects of human cognition are exploited by these cyberattacks, why humans are susceptible to these cyberattacks, and how we can minimize or at least mitigate their damage. These questions have received some amount of attention but the state-of-the-art understanding is superficial and scattered in the literature. In this paper, we review human cognition through the lens of social engineering cyberattacks. Then, we propose an extended framework of human cognitive functions to accommodate social engineering cyberattacks. We cast existing studies on various aspects of social engineering cyberattacks into the extended framework, while drawing a number of insights that represent the current understanding and shed light on future research directions. The extended framework might inspire future research endeavors towards a new sub-field that can be called Cybersecurity Cognitive Psychology, which tailors or adapts principles of Cognitive Psychology to the cybersecurity domain while embracing new notions and concepts that are unique to the cybersecurity domain.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of cyber relevant data has become an area of increasing focus. As larger percentages of businesses and governments begin to understand the implications of cyberattacks, the impetus for better cybersecurity solutions has increased. Unfortunately, current cybersecurity datasets either offer no ground truth or do so with anonymized data. The former leads to a quandary when verifying results and the latter can remove valuable information. Additionally, most existing datasets are large enough to make them unwieldy during prototype development. In this paper we have developed the PicoDomain dataset, a compact high-fidelity collection of Zeek logs from a realistic intrusion using relevant Tools, Techniques, and Procedures. While simulated on a small-scale network, this dataset consists of traffic typical of an enterprise network, which can be utilized for rapid validation and iterative development of analytics platforms. We have validated this dataset using traditional statistical analysis and off-the-shelf Machine Learning techniques.",

As organizers of yearly events, we present a taxonomy for interactive cyber training and education. The proposed taxonomy includes different factors of the technical setup, audience, training environment, and training setup. By the comprehensive taxonomy, different aspects of interactive training are considered. This can help trainings to improve and to be established successfully. The provided taxonomy is extendable and can be used in further application areas as research on new security technologies.",

    "abstract": "Bug bounty programs offer a modern platform for organizations to crowdsource their software security and for security researchers to be fairly rewarded for the vulnerabilities they find. Little is known however on the incentives set by bug bounty programs: How they drive new bug discoveries, and how they supposedly improve security through the progressive exhaustion of discoverable vulnerabilities. Here, we recognize that bug bounty programs create tensions, for organizations running them on the one hand, and for security researchers on the other hand. At the level of one bug bounty program, security researchers face a sort of St-Petersburg paradox: The probability of finding additional bugs decays fast, and thus can hardly be matched with a sufficient increase of monetary rewards. Furthermore, bug bounty program managers have an incentive to gather the largest possible crowd to ensure a larger pool of expertise, which in turn increases competition among security researchers. As a result, we find that researchers have high incentives to switch to newly launched programs, for which a reserve of low-hanging fruit vulnerabilities is still available. Our results inform on the technical and economic mechanisms underlying the dynamics of bug bounty program contributions, and may in turn help improve the mechanism design of bug bounty programs that get increasingly adopted by cybersecurity savvy organizations.",

    "abstract": "The benefits of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are widely acknowledged, but there are concerns about the extent of these benefits and AV risks and unintended consequences. In this article, we first examine AVs and different categories of the technological risks associated with them. We then explore strategies that can be adopted to address these risks, and explore emerging responses by governments for addressing AV risks. Our analyses reveal that, thus far, governments have in most instances avoided stringent measures in order to promote AV developments and the majority of responses are non-binding and focus on creating councils or working groups to better explore AV implications. The US has been active in introducing legislations to address issues related to privacy and cybersecurity. The UK and Germany, in particular, have enacted laws to address liability issues, other countries mostly acknowledge these issues, but have yet to implement specific strategies. To address privacy and cybersecurity risks strategies ranging from introduction or amendment of non-AV specific legislation to creating working groups have been adopted. Much less attention has been paid to issues such as environmental and employment risks, although a few governments have begun programmes to retrain workers who might be negatively affected.",

These recent attacks have shacked the maritime domain, which was thought to be relatively immune to cyber threats. The cited belief is now over, as proved by recent mandates issued by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). According to these regulations, all vessels should be the subject of a cybersecurity risk analysis, and technical controls should be adopted to mitigate the resulting risks. This initiative is laudable since, despite the recent incidents, the vulnerabilities and threats affecting modern vessels are still unclear to operating entities, leaving the potential for dreadful consequences of further attacks just a matter of \"when\", not \"if\". In this contribution, we investigate and systematize the major security weaknesses affecting systems and communication technologies adopted in modern vessels. Specifically, we describe the architecture and main features of the different systems, pointing out their main security issues, and specifying how they were exploited by attackers to cause service disruption and relevant financial losses. We also identify a few countermeasures to the introduced attacks. Finally, we highlight a few research challenges to be addressed by industry and academia to strengthen vessels security.",

    "abstract": "This chapter introduces the Accountability Principle and its role in data protection governance. We focus on what accountability means in the context of cybersecurity management in smart homes, considering the EU General Data Protection Law requirements to secure personal data. This discussion sits against the backdrop of two key new developments in data protection law. Firstly, the law is moving into the home, due to narrowing of the so called household exemption. Concurrently, household occupants may now have legal responsibilities to comply with the GDPR, as they find themselves jointly responsible for compliance, as they are possibly held to determine the means and purposes of data collection with IoT device vendors. As a complex socio-technical space, we consider the interactions between accountability requirements and the competencies of this new class of domestic data controllers (DDCs). Specifically, we consider the value and limitations of edge-based security analytics to manage smart home cybersecurity risks, reviewing a range of prototypes and studies of their use. We also reflect on interpersonal power dynamics in the domestic setting e.g. device control; existing social practices around privacy and security management in smart homes; and usability issues that may hamper DDCs ability to rely on such solutions. We conclude by reflecting on 1) the need for collective security management in homes and 2) the increasingly complex divisions of responsibility in smart homes between device users, account holders, IoT device/software/firmware vendors, and third parties.",

Using the AS map, malicious infections are simulated and different defense strategies are considered in a cost benefit framework. The results show that protecting the most connected nodes provides significant gains in security and that after the small minority of most connected nodes are protected there are diminishing returns for further protection. Although if parts of the small minority are not protected, such as non-US networks, protection levels are significantly decreased.",

Nature has provided species with a whole range of offensive and defensive techniques, which have been developing and improving in the course of billions of years of evolution. The extremely diverse living conditions have promoted a large variation in the devised bio-security solutions. In this paper we introduce a novel PROTECTION framework in which common denominators of the encountered offensive and defensive means are proposed and presented. The bio-inspired solutions are discussed in the context of cybersecurity, where some principles have already been adopted. The deployment of the whole nature-based framework should aid the design and improvement process of modern cyber-defense systems.",

This paper examines potential attack vectors for generalized distributed optimization problems, with a focus on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), a popular tool for convex optimization. Methods for detecting and mitigating attacks in ADMM problems are described, and simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed models. The weaknesses of fully-decentralized optimization schemes, in which nodes communicate directly with neighbors, is demonstrated, and a number of potential architectures for providing security to these networks is discussed.",

Traditional security has accomplished a long way toward protecting well-defined goals such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity. However, with the growing sophistication of the attacks and the complexity of the system, the protection using traditional methods could be cost-prohibitive. A new perspective and a new theoretical foundation are needed to understand security from a strategic and decision-making perspective. Game theory provides a natural framework to capture the adversarial and defensive interactions between an attacker and a defender. It provides a quantitative assessment of security, prediction of security outcomes, and a mechanism design tool that can enable security-by-design and reverse the attacker's advantage. This tutorial provides an overview of diverse methodologies from game theory that includes games of incomplete information, dynamic games, mechanism design theory to offer a modern theoretic underpinning of a science of cybersecurity. The tutorial will also discuss open problems and research challenges that the CCS community can address and contribute with an objective to build a multidisciplinary bridge between cybersecurity, economics, game and decision theory.",

We first define a game that a CRO infiltrates another pool and perform an attack. In such game, the honest CRO can control the payoffs and increase its revenue. By simulating this game, we propose to apply Zero Determinant (ZD) strategy on strategy decision, which can be categorized into cooperation and defecting.

As such, the extension of cybersecurity concerns into the cyber-physical domain introduces new possibilities for self-organized phenomena in traffic flow. Here, we study a scenario envisioned by cybersecurity experts leading to a large number of Internet-connected vehicles being suddenly and simultaneously disabled. We investigate post-hack traffic using agent-based simulations, and discover the critical relevance of percolation for probabilistically predicting the outcomes on a multi-lane road in the immediate aftermath of a vehicle-targeted cyber attack. We develop an analytic percolation-based model to rapidly assess road conditions given the density of disabled vehicles and apply it to study the street network of Manhattan (NY, USA) revealing the city's vulnerability to this particular cyber-physical attack.",

    "abstract": "Deceptive and anti-deceptive technologies have been developed for various specific applications. But there is a significant need for a general, holistic, and quantitative framework of deception. Game theory provides an ideal set of tools to develop such a framework of deception. In particular, game theory captures the strategic and self-interested nature of attackers and defenders in cybersecurity. Additionally, control theory can be used to quantify the physical impact of attack and defense strategies. In this tutorial, we present an overview of game-theoretic models and design mechanisms for deception and counter-deception. The tutorial aims to provide a taxonomy of deception and counter-deception and understand how they can be conceptualized, quantified, and designed or mitigated. This tutorial gives an overview of diverse methodologies from game theory that includes games of incomplete information, dynamic games, mechanism design theory to offer a modern theoretic underpinning of cyberdeception. The tutorial will also discuss open problems and research challenges that the HoTSoS community can address and contribute with an objective to build a multidisciplinary bridge between cybersecurity, economics, game and decision theory.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system testbed used for cybersecurity research. The testbed consists of a water storage tank's control system, which is a stage in the process of water treatment and distribution. Sophisticated cyber-attacks were conducted against the testbed. During the attacks, the network traffic was captured, and features were extracted from the traffic to build a dataset for training and testing different machine learning algorithms. Five traditional machine learning algorithms were trained to detect the attacks: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and KNN. Then, the trained machine learning models were built and deployed in the network, where new tests were made using online network traffic. The performance obtained during the training and testing of the machine learning models was compared to the performance obtained during the online deployment of these models in the network. The results show the efficiency of the machine learning models in detecting the attacks in real time. The testbed provides a good understanding of the effects and consequences of attacks on real SCADA environments",

These systems depend on the timeliness and relevance of the latest updates, patches and threats provided by cyberthreat intelligence feeds. Open source intelligence platforms, namely social media networks such as Twitter, are capable of aggregating a vast amount of cybersecurity-related sources. To process such information streams, we require scalable and efficient tools capable of identifying and summarizing relevant information for specified assets. This paper presents the processing pipeline of a novel tool that uses deep neural networks to process cybersecurity information received from Twitter. A convolutional neural network identifies tweets containing security-related information relevant to assets in an IT infrastructure. Then, a bidirectional long short-term memory network extracts named entities from these tweets to form a security alert or to fill an indicator of compromise. The proposed pipeline achieves an average 94% true positive rate and 91% true negative rate for the classification task and an average F1-score of 92% for the named entity recognition task, across three case study infrastructures.",

However, web traffic is also a rich source of information for cybersecurity monitoring efforts. To better understand the threat of malicious cyber actors, this study develops a methodology to monitor and evaluate web activity using data archived from Google Analytics. Google Analytics collects and aggregates web traffic, including information about web visitors' location, date and time of visit, visited webpages, and searched keywords. This study seeks to streamline analysis of this data and uses rule-based anomaly detection and predictive modeling to identify web traffic that deviates from normal patterns. Rather than evaluating pieces of web traffic individually, the methodology seeks to emulate real user behavior by creating a new unit of analysis: the user session. User sessions group individual pieces of traffic from the same location and date, which transforms the available information from single point-in-time snapshots to dynamic sessions showing users' trajectory and intent. The result is faster and better insight into large volumes of noisy web traffic.",

This information can be extracted from Open Source Intelligence published daily by users, security organisations, and researchers. In particular, Twitter has become an information hub for obtaining cutting-edge information about many subjects, including cybersecurity. This work proposes SYNAPSE, a Twitter-based streaming threat monitor that generates a continuously updated summary of the threat landscape related to a monitored infrastructure. Its tweet-processing pipeline is composed of filtering, feature extraction, binary classification, an innovative clustering strategy, and generation of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). A quantitative evaluation considering all tweets from 80 accounts over more than 8 months (over 195.000 tweets), shows that our approach timely and successfully finds the majority of security-related tweets concerning an example IT infrastructure (true positive rate above 90%), incorrectly selects a small number of tweets as relevant (false positive rate under 10%), and summarises the results to very few IoCs per day. A qualitative evaluation of the IoCs generated by SYNAPSE demonstrates their relevance (based on the CVSS score and the availability of patches or exploits), and timeliness (based on threat disclosure dates from NVD).",

This log files are usually inspected, in a semi-automatic way, by security analysts to detect events that may affect system integrity. On this basis, we propose a parameter-free methodology to detect security incidents from structured text regardless its nature. We use the Normalized Compression Distance to obtain a set of features that can be used by a Support Vector Machine to classify events from a heterogeneous cybersecurity environment. In specific, we explore and validate the application of our methodology in four different cybersecurity domains: HTTP anomaly identification, spam detection, Domain Generation Algorithms tracking and sentiment analysis.

To identify and defend against a range of possible attack scenarios, we develop a new measure of exploitability for implicit interactions to aid in evaluating the threat posed by the existence of such vulnerabilities in system designs for launching cyber-attacks. The presented approach is based on the modeling and analysis of the influence and response of the system agents and their C$^2$KA specifications.

However, it is very difficult to evaluate how good the produced solutions are, since the challenges faced in security may not appear in other areas (at least not in the same way). One of these challenges is the concept drift, that actually creates an arms race between attackers and defenders, given that any attacker may create novel, different threats as time goes by (to overcome defense solutions) and this \"evolution\" is not always considered in many works. Due to this type of issue, it is fundamental to know how to correctly build and evaluate a ML-based security solution. In this work, we list, detail, and discuss some of the challenges of applying ML to cybersecurity, including concept drift, concept evolution, delayed labels, and adversarial machine learning.

HackER then uses a bidirectional long short-term memory model (BiLSTM) to create a predictive model for what companies will be targeted by exploits. The results of the algorithm will be evaluated using a manually labeled gold-standard test dataset, using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as metrics. We choose to compare our model against state of the art classical machine learning and deep learning benchmark models. Results show that our proposed HackER BiLSTM model outperforms all classical machine learning and deep learning models in F1-score (79.71%).

We evaluated whether the comics fulfilled our requirements based on the responses of the participants. We showed the comics, on various cybersecurity concepts, to 20 volunteers.

Recent innovations in ubiquitous computing and communication technologies have prompted the rapid integration of highly interconnected systems to ICPSs. Hence, the \"security by obscurity\" principle provided by air-gapping is no longer followed. As the interconnectivity in ICPSs increases, so does the attack surface. Industrial vulnerability assessment reports have shown that a variety of new vulnerabilities have occurred due to this transition while the most common ones are related to weak boundary protection. Although there are existing surveys in this context, very little is mentioned regarding these reports. This paper bridges this gap by defining and reviewing ICPSs from a cybersecurity perspective. In particular, multi-dimensional adaptive attack taxonomy is presented and utilized for evaluating real-life ICPS cyber incidents. We also identify the general shortcomings and highlight the points that cause a gap in existing literature while defining future research directions.",

We enumerate concerns whose consideration we find paramount for the design of a privacy-enhancing identity brokering solution, for identification and authentication of citizens into myriad online services, and we recommend how to incorporate them into a revised white paper. Our observations, focused on privacy, security, auditability and forensics, are mostly based on a recently published research paper (PETS 2015) about two nation-scale brokered identification systems.",

Each player does not know the other players' action sets, their deployed actions or the structures of its own or the others' utility functions. Instead, each player only knows its own deployed actions and its received utility values in recent history. We propose a reinforcement learning algorithm which converges to the set of action profiles which have maximal stochastic potential with probability one. Furthermore, the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is quantified. The algorithm performance is verified using two case studies in the smart grid and cybersecurity.",

Skin secretions contain a large number of metabolites and small molecules that can be targeted for analysis. Here we argue that amino acids found in sweat can be exploited for the establishment of an amino acid profile capable of identifying an individual user of a mobile or wearable device. Individual and combinations of amino acids processed by biocatalytic cascades yield physical (optical or electronic) signals, providing a time-series of several outputs that, in their entirety, should suffice to authenticate a specific user based on standard statistical criteria. Initial results, motivated by biometrics, indicate that single amino acid levels can provide analog signals that vary according to the individual donor, albeit with limited resolution versus noise. However, some such assays offer digital separation (into well-defined ranges of values) according to groups such as age, biological sex, race, and physiological state of the individual. Multi-input biocatalytic cascades that handle several amino acid signals to yield a single digital-type output, as well as continuous-tracking time-series data rather than a single-instance sample, should enable active authentication at the level of an individual.",

First, we carry out a comparative performance analysis of four detection procedures: the CUSUM procedure, the Shiryaev-Roberts (SR) procedure, and two its modifications - the Shiryaev-Roberts-Pollak and Shiryaev-Roberts-r procedures. The performance is benchmarked via Pollak's maximal average delay to detection and Shiryaev's stationary average delay to detection, each subject to a fixed average run length to false alarm. The analysis shows that in practically interesting cases the accuracy of asymptotic approximations is \"reasonable\" to \"excellent\". We also consider an application of change-point detection to cybersecurity - for rapid anomaly detection in computer networks. Using real network data we show that statistically traffic's intensity can be well-described by the proposed Gaussian model with \\sigma^2=a\\mu instead of the traditional Poisson model, which requires \\sigma^2=\\mu. By successively devising the SR and CUSUM procedures to \"catch\" a low-contrast network anomaly (caused by an ICMP reflector attack), we then show that the SR rule is quicker. We conclude that the SR procedure is a better cyber \"watch dog\" than the popular CUSUM procedure.",

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity is increasingly threatened by advanced and persistent attacks. As these attacks are often designed to disable a system (or a critical resource, e.g., a user account) repeatedly, it is crucial for the defender to keep updating its security measures to strike a balance between the risk of being compromised and the cost of security updates. Moreover, these decisions often need to be made with limited and delayed feedback due to the stealthy nature of advanced attacks. In addition to targeted attacks, such an optimal timing policy under incomplete information has broad applications in cybersecurity. Examples include key rotation, password change, application of patches, and virtual machine refreshing. However, rigorous studies of optimal timing are rare. Further, existing solutions typically rely on a pre-defined attack model that is known to the defender, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we make an initial effort towards achieving optimal timing of security updates in the face of unknown stealthy attacks. We consider a variant of the influential FlipIt game model with asymmetric feedback and unknown attack time distribution, which provides a general model to consecutive security updates. The defender's problem is then modeled as a time associative bandit problem with dependent arms. We derive upper confidence bound based learning policies that achieve low regret compared with optimal periodic defense strategies that can only be derived when attack time distributions are known.",

To improve the generality of malicious URL detectors, machine learning techniques have been explored with increasing attention in recent years. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of Malicious URL Detection techniques using machine learning. We present the formal formulation of Malicious URL Detection as a machine learning task, and categorize and review the contributions of literature studies that addresses different dimensions of this problem (feature representation, algorithm design, etc.). Further, this article provides a timely and comprehensive survey for a range of different audiences, not only for machine learning researchers and engineers in academia, but also for professionals and practitioners in cybersecurity industry, to help them understand the state of the art and facilitate their own research and practical applications. We also discuss practical issues in system design, open research challenges, and point out some important directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "A connected vehicle (CV) environment is composed of a diverse data collection, data communication and dissemination, and computing infrastructure systems that are vulnerable to the same cyberattacks as all traditional computing environments. Cyberattacks can jeopardize the expected safety, mobility, energy, and environmental benefits from connected vehicle applications. As cyberattacks can lead to severe traffic incidents, it has become one of the primary concerns in connected vehicle applications. In this paper, we investigate the impact of cyberattacks on the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) network from a V2I application point of view. Then, we develop a novel V2I cybersecurity architecture, named CVGuard, which can detect and prevent cyberattacks on the V2I environment. In designing CVGuard, key challenges, such as scalability, resiliency and future usability were considered. A case study using a distributed denial of service (DDoS) on a V2I application, i.e., the Stop Sign Gap Assist (SSGA) application, shows that CVGuard was effective in mitigating the adverse effects created by a DDoS attack. In our case study, because of the DDoS attack, conflicts between the minor and major road vehicles occurred in an unsignalized intersection, which could have caused potential crashes. A reduction of conflicts between vehicles occurred because CVGuard was in operation. The reduction of conflicts was compared based on the number of conflicts before and after the implementation and operation of the CVGuard security platform. Analysis revealed that the strategies adopted by the CVGuard were successful in reducing the inter-vehicle conflicts by 60% where a DDoS attack compromised the SSGA application at an unsignalized intersection.",

    "abstract": "Learning-based pattern classifiers, including deep networks, have shown impressive performance in several application domains, ranging from computer vision to cybersecurity. However, it has also been shown that adversarial input perturbations carefully crafted either at training or at test time can easily subvert their predictions. The vulnerability of machine learning to such wild patterns (also referred to as adversarial examples), along with the design of suitable countermeasures, have been investigated in the research field of adversarial machine learning. In this work, we provide a thorough overview of the evolution of this research area over the last ten years and beyond, starting from pioneering, earlier work on the security of non-deep learning algorithms up to more recent work aimed to understand the security properties of deep learning algorithms, in the context of computer vision and cybersecurity tasks. We report interesting connections between these apparently-different lines of work, highlighting common misconceptions related to the security evaluation of machine-learning algorithms. We review the main threat models and attacks defined to this end, and discuss the main limitations of current work, along with the corresponding future challenges towards the design of more secure learning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "As new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) are integrated into Critical National Infrastructures (CNI), new cybersecurity threats emerge that require specific security solutions. Approaches used for analysis include the modelling and simulation of critical infrastructure systems using attributes, functionalities, operations, and behaviours to support various security analysis viewpoints, recognising and appropriately managing associated security risks. With several critical infrastructure protection approaches available, the question of how to effectively model the complex behaviour of interconnected CNI elements and to configure their protection as a system-of-systems remains a challenge. Using a systematic review approach, existing critical infrastructure protection approaches (tools and techniques) are examined to determine their suitability given trends like IoT, and effective security modelling and analysis issues. It is found that empirical-based, agent-based, system dynamics-based, and network-based modelling are more commonly applied than economic-based and equation-based techniques, and empirical-based modelling is the most widely used. The energy and transportation critical infrastructure sectors reflect the most responsive sectors, and no one Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) approach - tool, technique, methodology or framework -- provides a fit-for-all capacity for all-round attribute modelling and simulation of security risks. Typically, deciding factors for CIP choices to adopt are often dominated by trade-offs between complexity of use and popularity of approach, as well as between specificity and generality of application in sectors.",

    "abstract": "Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is popularly used in practice for privacy-preserving data collection. Although existing LDP protocols offer high utility for large user populations (100,000 or more users), they perform poorly in scenarios with small user populations (such as those in the cybersecurity domain) and lack perturbation mechanisms that are effective for both ordinal and non-ordinal item sequences while protecting sequence length and content simultaneously. In this paper, we address the small user population problem by introducing the concept of Condensed Local Differential Privacy (CLDP) as a specialization of LDP, and develop a suite of CLDP protocols that offer desirable statistical utility while preserving privacy. Our protocols support different types of client data, ranging from ordinal data types in finite metric spaces (numeric malware infection statistics), to non-ordinal items (OS versions, transaction categories), and to sequences of ordinal and non-ordinal items. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets, including datasets that are an order of magnitude smaller than those used in existing approaches, which show that proposed CLDP protocols yield high utility. Furthermore, case studies with Symantec datasets demonstrate that our protocols accurately support key cybersecurity-focused tasks of detecting ransomware outbreaks, identifying targeted and vulnerable OSs, and inspecting suspicious activities on infected machines.",

To our knowledge, we are the first to propose and study this approach. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we collected approximately 180 open-ended responses to several question stems from the Cybersecurity Concept Inventory of the Cybersecurity Assessment Tools Project and from the Digital Logic Concept Inventory. We generated preliminary distractors by filtering responses, grouping similar responses, selecting the four most frequent groups, and refining a representative distractor for each of these groups. We analyzed our data in two ways. First, we compared the responses and resulting distractors with those from the aforementioned inventories. Second, we obtained feedback from Amazon Mechanical Turk on the resulting new draft test items (including distractors) from additional subjects. Challenges in using crowdsourcing include controlling the selection of subjects and filtering out responses that do not reflect genuine effort. Despite these challenges, our results suggest that crowdsourcing can be a very useful tool in generating effective distractors (attractive to subjects who do not understand the targeted concept). Our results also suggest that this method is faster, easier, and cheaper than is the traditional method of having one or more experts draft distractors, and building on talk-aloud interviews with subjects to uncover their misconceptions. Our results are significant because generating effective distractors is one of the most difficult steps in creating multiple-choice assessments.",

    "abstract": "Mobile applications are used to handle different types of data. Commonly, there is a set of personal identifiable information present in the data stored, shared and used by these applications. From that, attackers can try to exploit the mobile application in order to obtain or to cause private data leakage. Therefore, performing security assessments is an important practice to find vulnerabilities in the applications and systems before the application is deployed, or even during their use. Regarding security assessments, Penetration Test (Pentest) is one of the security test types that can be used to detect vulnerabilities through simulated attacks. Additionally, Pentest can be performed using different methodologies and best practices, through several frameworks to: organize the test execution, execute tools, provide estimations, provide reports and document a Pentest. One such framework is Tramonto, which aims to assist a cybersecurity expert during the Pentest execution by providing organization, standardization and flexibility to the whole Pentest process. This paper presents a Pentest case study applied to a Brazilian university Mobile App using the Tramonto framework. The main goal of this case study is to present how Tramonto can be applied during a Pentest execution, assisting cybersecurity experts in the tasks included in the Pentest process. Our results show details on how to perform a Pentest using Tramonto and the found vulnerabilities in the Mobile App. Besides that, there is a discussion about the main contributions obtained from our results, and we were able to verify that Tramonto managed, organized and optimized the whole Pentest process.",

In collaboration with domain experts, we formulated user requirements that cover three cognitive perspectives: gameplay overview, person-centric view, and comparative feedback. Based on these requirements, we designed two interactive visualizations that provide complementary views on game results. They combine a known clustering and time-based visual approaches to show game results in a way that is easy to decode for players. The purposefulness of our visual feedback was evaluated in a usability field study with attendees of the Summer School in Cyber Security. The evaluation confirmed the adequacy of the two visualizations for instant post-game feedback.

One of the most dangerous cybersecurity threats is the False Data Injection (FDI) attack, especially when it is capable of completely bypassing the widely deployed Bad Data Detector of State Estimation and interrupting the normal operation of the power system. Most of the simulated FDI attacks are designed using simplified linearized DC model while most industry standard State Estimation systems are based on the nonlinear AC model. In this paper, a comprehensive FDI attack scheme is presented based on the nonlinear AC model. A case study of the nine-bus Western System Coordinated Council (WSCC)'s power system is provided, using an industry standard package to assess the outcomes of the proposed design scheme. A public FDI dataset is generated as a test set for the community to develop and evaluate new detection algorithms, which are lacking in the field. The FDI's stealthy quality of the dataset is assessed and proven through a preliminary analysis based on both physical power law and statistical analysis.",

    "abstract": "In order to withstand the ever-increasing invasion of privacy by CCTV cameras and technologies, on par CCTV-aware solutions must exist that provide privacy, safety, and cybersecurity features. We argue that a first important step towards such CCTV-aware solutions must be a mapping system (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap) that provides both privacy and safety routing and navigation options. However, this in turn requires that the mapping system contains updated information on CCTV cameras' exact geo-location, coverage area, and possibly other meta-data (e.g., resolution, facial recognition features, operator). Such information is however missing from current mapping systems, and there are several ways to fix this. One solution is to perform CCTV camera detection on geo-location tagged images, e.g., street view imagery on various platforms, user images publicly posted in image sharing platforms such as Flickr. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there are no computer vision models for CCTV camera object detection as well as no mapping system that supports privacy and safety routing options. To close these gaps, with this paper we introduce the first and only computer vision MS COCO-compatible models that are able to accurately detect CCTV and video surveillance cameras in images and video frames. To this end, our best detectors were built using 8387 images that were manually reviewed and annotated to contain 10419 CCTV camera instances, and achieve an accuracy of up to 98.7%. Moreover, we build and evaluate multiple models, present a comprehensive comparison of their performance, and outline core challenges associated with such research.",

    "abstract": "Ahead of the rollout of the SwissCovid contact tracing app, an official public security test was performed. During this audit, Prof. Serge Vaudenay and Dr. Martin Vuagnoux described a large set of problems with the app, including a new variation of a known false-positive attack, leveraging a cryptographic weakness in the Google and Apple Exposure Notification framework to tamper with the emitted Bluetooth beacons. Separately, the first author described a re-identification attack leveraging rogue apps or SDKs. The response from the Swiss cybersecurity agency and the Swiss public health authority was to claim these various attacks were unlikely as they required physical proximity of the attacker with the target (although it was admitted the attacker could be further than two meters). The physical presence of the attacker in Switzerland was deemed significant as it would imply such attackers would fall under the Swiss Criminal Code. We show through one example that a much larger variety of adversaries must be considered in the scenarios originally described and that these attacks can be done by adversaries without any physical presence in Switzerland. This goes directly against official findings of Swiss public authorities evaluating the risks associated with SwissCovid. To move the discussion further along, we briefly discuss the growth of the attack surface and harms with COVID-19 and SwissCovid prevalence in the population. While the focus of this article is on Switzerland, we emphasize the core technical findings and cybersecurity concerns are of relevance to many contact tracing efforts.",

While the inclusion of intermittent RES coupled with the wide-scale deployment of communication and sensing devices is important towards a fully smart grid, it has also expanded the cyber-threat landscape, effectively making power systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. This paper proposes a cybersecurity assessment approach designed to assess the cyberphysical security of EPS. The work takes into consideration the intermittent generation of RES, vulnerabilities introduced by microprocessor-based electronic information and operational technology (IT/OT) devices, and contingency analysis results. The proposed approach utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and an adapted Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score tailored to assess vulnerabilities in EPS in order to identify the optimal attack transition policy based on N-2 contingency results, i.e., the simultaneous failure of two system elements. The effectiveness of the work is validated via numerical and real-time simulation experiments performed on literature-based power grid test cases. The results demonstrate how the proposed method based on deep Q-network (DQN) performs closely to a graph-search approach in terms of the number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack policy, without the need for full observation of the system. In addition, the experiments present the method's scalability by showcasing the number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack transition policy in a large system such as the Polish 2383 bus test system. The results exhibit how the proposed approach requires one order of magnitude fewer transitions when compared to a random transition policy.",

On the IoT system model layer, perception layer was identified as the most vulnerable. Most attacks at this level occur due to limitations in hardware, physical exposure of devices, and heterogeneity of technologies. Future cybersecurity systems based on SDR radios have notable advantages due to their flexibility to adapt to new communication technologies and their potential for the development of advanced tools.

This field has increasingly been challenged by novel threats from nature that have been weaponized such as SARS, Anthrax, and similar pathogens, but has emerged victorious through collaboration of national and world health groups. However, it may come under additional stress in the 21st century as the field intersects with the cyberworld -- a world where governments have already been struggling to keep up with cyber attacks from small to state-level actors as cyberthreats have been relied on to level the playing field in international disputes. Disruptions to military logistics and economies through cyberattacks have been able to be done at a mere fraction of economic and moral costs through conventional military means, making it an increasingly tempting means of disruption. In the field of biocybersecurity (BCS), the strengths within biotechnology and cybersecurity merge, along with many of their vulnerabilities, and this could spell increased trouble for biodefense, as novel threats can be synthesized and disseminated in ways that fuse the routes of attacks seen in biosecurity and cybersecurity. Herein, we offer an exploration of how threats in the domain of biocybersecurity may emerge through less foreseen routes as it might be an attractive auxiliary to conventional war. This is done through an analysis of potential payload and delivery methods to develop notional threat vectorizations. We conclude with several paradigms through which to view BCS-based threats.",

    "abstract": "Purpose. This paper examines the Internet security perception of Filipinos to establish a need and sense of urgency on the part of the government to create a culture of cybersecurity for every Filipino. Method. A quantitative survey was conducted through traditional, online, and phone interviews among 252 respondents using a two-page questionnaire that covers basic demographic information and two key elements (1) Internet usage and (2) security practices. Results. Based on findings, there is a sharp increase in Internet users for the last three years (50%), and most access to the Internet through mobile (94.4%). Although at home is the most frequent location for Internet access (94.4%), a good percentage still use free WiFi access points available in malls (22.2%), restaurants (11.1%), and other public areas (38.9%) doing Internet services (email and downloading) that are vulnerable to cyberattacks. The study also revealed that although respondents may have good knowledge of Internet security software, proper implementation is very limited. Conclusion. Filipinos are susceptible to cyberattacks, particularly to phishing and malware attacks. Also, the majority of the respondents' Internet security perception is derivative: they practice online measures but with a limited understanding of the purpose. Therefore proper education, through training and awareness, is an effective approach to remedy the situation. Recommendations. The Philippine government must now take actions and tap industries to educate Filipinos about Internet security before any negative consequences happen in the future. Research Implications. The information collected sets a clear picture of the importance of cybersecurity awareness from a regional to a global perspective.",

    "abstract": "Attackers have developed ever more sophisticated and intelligent ways to hack information and communication technology systems. The extent of damage an individual hacker can carry out upon infiltrating a system is well understood. A potentially catastrophic scenario can be envisaged where a nation-state intercepting encrypted financial data gets hacked. Thus, intelligent cybersecurity systems have become inevitably important for improved protection against malicious threats. However, as malware attacks continue to dramatically increase in volume and complexity, it has become ever more challenging for traditional analytic tools to detect and mitigate threat. Furthermore, a huge amount of data produced by large networks has made the recognition task even more complicated and challenging. In this work, we propose an innovative statistical analysis driven optimized deep learning system for intrusion detection. The proposed intrusion detection system (IDS) extracts optimized and more correlated features using big data visualization and statistical analysis methods (human-in-the-loop), followed by a deep autoencoder for potential threat detection. Specifically, a pre-processing module eliminates the outliers and converts categorical variables into one-hot-encoded vectors. The feature extraction module discard features with null values and selects the most significant features as input to the deep autoencoder model (trained in a greedy-wise manner). The NSL-KDD dataset from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity is used as a benchmark to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Simulation results demonstrate the potential of our proposed system and its outperformance as compared to existing state-of-the-art methods and recently published novel approaches. Ongoing work includes further optimization and real-time evaluation of our proposed IDS.",

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity tools are increasingly automated with artificial intelligent (AI) capabilities to match the exponential scale of attacks, compensate for the relatively slower rate of training new cybersecurity talents, and improve of the accuracy and performance of both tools and users. However, the safe and appropriate usage of autonomous cyber attack tools - especially at the development stages for these tools - is still largely an unaddressed gap. Our survey of current literature and tools showed that most of the existing cyber range designs are mostly using manual tools and have not considered augmenting automated tools or the potential security issues caused by the tools. In other words, there is still room for a novel cyber range design which allow security researchers to safely deploy autonomous tools and perform automated tool testing if needed. In this paper, we introduce Pandora, a safe testing environment which allows security researchers and cyber range users to perform experiments on automated cyber attack tools that may have strong potential of usage and at the same time, a strong potential for risks. Unlike existing testbeds and cyber ranges which have direct compatibility with enterprise computer systems and the potential for risk propagation across the enterprise network, our test system is intentionally designed to be incompatible with enterprise real-world computing systems to reduce the risk of attack propagation into actual infrastructure. Our design also provides a tool to convert in-development automated cyber attack tools into to executable test binaries for validation and usage realistic enterprise system environments if required. Our experiments tested automated attack tools on our proposed system to validate the usability of our proposed environment. Our experiments also proved the safety of our environment by compatibility testing using simple malicious code.",

    "abstract": "We present a real-world application that uses a quantum computer. Specifically, we trained a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using quantum annealing (QA) to develop an intrusion detection system. RBMs were trained on the ISCX data, which is a benchmark dataset for cybersecurity. For comparison, RBMs were also trained using contrastive divergence (CD) which is a classical method. D-Wave's 2000Q quantum annealer has been used to implement QA. Our analysis of the ISCX data shows that the dataset is imbalanced and we present two different schemes to balance the training dataset before feeding it to a classifier. The first scheme is based on the oversampling of attack instances. The imbalanced training dataset was divided into five sub-datasets that were trained separately. A majority voting was performed to get the final result. Our results show the majority vote increased the classification accuracy up from 90.24% to 95.68% in the case of CD. For the case of QA, the classification accuracy increased from 74.14% to 80.04%. In the second scheme, an RBM was used to generate synthetic data to balance the training dataset. The RBMs trained on synthetic data generated from a CD-trained RBM performed comparably to the RBMs trained on synthetic data generated from a QA-trained RBM. Balanced training data was used to evaluate several classifiers. Among the classifiers investigated, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) performed better than other classifiers. They both showed an accuracy of 93%. Our results show a proof of concept that a QA-based RBM can be trained on a binary dataset, with 64-bit records. The illustrative example suggests the possibility to migrate many practical classification problems to QA-based techniques.",

Many of these applications require complex models and constituent rules in order to come up with decisions that influence the operation of entire systems. In this paper, we motivate the novel \"strategic planning\" problem -- one of gathering data from the world and applying the underlying model of the domain in order to come up with decisions that will monitor the system in an automated manner. We describe our use of automated planning methods to this problem, including the technique that we used to solve it in a manner that would scale to the demands of a real-time, real world scenario. We then present a PDDL model of one such application scenario related to network administration and monitoring, followed by a description of a novel integrated system that was built to accept generated plans and to continue the execution process. Finally, we present evaluations of two different automated planners and their different capabilities with our integrated system, both on a six-month window of network data, and using a simulator.",

The algorithm is quite different from existing approaches in that it is based on similarity search in the metric space of measure distributions on the dictionary. At the preprocessing stage, given a labeled learning sample of texts, we associate to every class label (document category) a point in the space of question. Unlike it is usual in clustering, this point is not a centroid of the category but rather an outlier, a uniform measure distribution on a selection of domain-specific words. At the execution stage, an unlabeled text is assigned a text category as defined by the closest labeled neighbour to the point representing the frequency distribution of the words in the text. The algorithm is both effective and efficient, as further confirmed by experiments on the Reuters 21578 dataset.",

The links between members of the community can be presented visually and often this can make patterns in the structure of sub-communities immediately obvious. The links and structures of layered communities can also be formalized to gain a better understanding of their modelling. This paper explores these links with some specific examples, including visualization of these relationships and a formalized model of communities using the Z notation. It also considers the development of such communities within the Community of Practice social science framework. Such approaches may be applicable for communities associated with cybersecurity and could be combined for a better understanding of their development.",

However, here we focus only on the core and critical component of the middleware, i.e. Execution Monitor which is a part of the module \"Architectural Differencer\" of AWDRAT. The role of the execution monitor is to identify inconsistencies between runtime observations of the target system and predictions of the System Architectural Model. Therefore, to achieve this goal, we first define the formal (denotational) semantics of the observations (runtime events) and predictions (executable specifications as of System Architectural Model); then based on the aforementioned formal semantices, we formalize the behavior of the \"Execution Monitor\" of the middleware.",

In this paper, we propose a novel and systematic method to select security countermeasures from a pool of candidates, by ranking them based on the technical and financial impact associated to each alternative. The method includes industrial evaluation and simulations of the impact associated to a given security measure which allows to compute the return on response investment for different candidates.

The increasing scale and sophistication of attacks, has prompted the need for a data driven solution, with machine learning forming the core of many cybersecurity systems. Machine learning was not designed with security in mind, and the essential assumption of stationarity, requiring that the training and testing data follow similar distributions, is violated in an adversarial domain. In this paper, an adversary's view point of a classification based system, is presented. Based on a formal adversarial model, the Seed-Explore-Exploit framework is presented, for simulating the generation of data driven and reverse engineering attacks on classifiers. Experimental evaluation, on 10 real world datasets and using the Google Cloud Prediction Platform, demonstrates the innate vulnerability of classifiers and the ease with which evasion can be carried out, without any explicit information about the classifier type, the training data or the application domain. The proposed framework, algorithms and empirical evaluation, serve as a white hat analysis of the vulnerabilities, and aim to foster the development of secure machine learning frameworks.",

Using appropriate cryptographic tools, entities can estimate the benefits of collaboration and agree on what to share in a privacy-preserving way, without having to disclose their datasets. We focus on collaborative predictive blacklisting, i.e., forecasting attack sources based on one's logs and those contributed by other organizations. We study the impact of different sharing strategies by experimenting on a real-world dataset of two billion suspicious IP addresses collected from Dshield over two months. We find that controlled data sharing yields up to 105% accuracy improvement on average, while also reducing the false positive rate.",

Specifically, we show that incentives for full cooperation can be designed if firms share their private assessments of other firms' disclosure decisions through a common communication platform. We further show that similar incentives can be designed based on outcomes of a public rating/assessment system.",

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity research involves publishing papers about malicious exploits as much as publishing information on how to design tools to protect cyber-infrastructure. It is this information exchange between ethical hackers and security experts, which results in a well-balanced cyber-ecosystem. In the blooming domain of AI Safety Engineering, hundreds of papers have been published on different proposals geared at the creation of a safe machine, yet nothing, to our knowledge, has been published on how to design a malevolent machine. Availability of such information would be of great value particularly to computer scientists, mathematicians, and others who have an interest in AI safety, and who are attempting to avoid the spontaneous emergence or the deliberate creation of a dangerous AI, which can negatively affect human activities and in the worst case cause the complete obliteration of the human species. This paper provides some general guidelines for the creation of a Malevolent Artificial Intelligence (MAI).",

    "abstract": "In critical infrastructures, communication networks are used to exchange vital data among elements of Industrial Control Systems (ICSes). Due to the criticality of such systems and the increase of the cybersecurity risks in these contexts, best practices recommend the adoption of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) as monitoring facilities. The choice of the positions of IDSes is crucial to monitor as many streams of data traffic as possible. This is especially true for the traffic patterns of ICS networks, mostly confined in many subnetworks, which are geographically distributed and largely autonomous. We introduce a methodology and a software architecture that allow an ICS operator to use the spare bandwidth that might be available in over-provisioned networks to forward replicas of traffic streams towards a single IDS placed at an arbitrary location. We leverage certain characteristics of ICS networks, like stability of topology and bandwidth needs predictability, and make use of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. We fulfill strict requirements about packet loss, for both functional and security aspects. Finally, we evaluate our approach on network topologies derived from real networks.",

    "abstract": "In a world of ever-increasing systems interdependence, effective cybersecurity policy design seems to be one of the most critically understudied elements of our national security strategy. Enterprise cyber technologies are often implemented without much regard to the interactions that occur between humans and the new technology. Furthermore, the interactions that occur between individuals can often have an impact on the newly employed technology as well. Without a rigorous, evidence-based approach to ground an employment strategy and elucidate the emergent organizational needs that will come with the fielding of new cyber capabilities, one is left to speculate on the impact that novel technologies will have on the aggregate functioning of the enterprise. In this paper, we will explore a scenario in which a hypothetical government agency applies a complexity science perspective, supported by agent-based modeling, to more fully understand the impacts of strategic policy decisions. We present a model to explore the socio-technical dynamics of these systems, discuss lessons using this platform, and suggest further research and development.",

We analogize this to thinking `fast' in vector space along with thinking 'slow' and `deeply' by reasoning over the knowledge graph. We have created a query processing engine that takes complex queries and decomposes them into subqueries optimized to run on the respective knowledge graph or vector view of a VKG. We show that the VKG structure can process specific queries that are not efficiently handled by vector spaces or knowledge graphs alone. We also demonstrate and evaluate the VKG structure and the query processing engine by developing a system called Cyber-All-Intel for knowledge extraction, representation and querying in an end-to-end pipeline grounded in the cybersecurity informatics domain.",

Using the CERT Insider Threat Dataset v6.2 and threat detection recall as our performance metric, our novel deep and recurrent neural network models outperform Principal Component Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Isolation Forest based anomaly detection baselines.

Inexact matching procedures can yield multiple shadow hits, which must be filtered, according to some criterion, to obtain a concise and meaningful list of occurrences. The filtering procedures are often computationally demanding and are performed offline in a post-processing phase. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for Online Approximate String Matching (OASM) able to filter shadow hits on the fly, according to general purpose priority rules that greedily assign priorities to overlapping hits. An FPGA hardware implementation of OASM is proposed and compared with a serial software version. Even when implemented on entry level FPGAs, the proposed procedure can reach a high degree of parallelism and superior performance in time compared to the software implementation, while keeping low the usage of logic elements. This makes the developed architecture very competitive in terms of both performance and cost of the overall computing system.",

Comprehensive experiments conducted on a dataset consisting of 3500 samples with 30 RSST derived essential system calls resulted in an accuracy of 99.9%, Area Under Curve (AUC) of 1.0, with 1% False Positive Rate (FPR). However, other feature selectors (Information Gain, CFsSubsetEval, ChiSquare, FreqSel and Symmetric Uncertainty) used in the domain of malware analysis resulted in the accuracy of 95.5% with 8.5% FPR. Besides, empirical analysis of RSST derived system calls outperform other attributes such as permissions, opcodes, API, methods, call graphs, Droidbox attributes and network traces.",

While the landscape of opportunities and the advantages of deep RL algorithms are justifiably vast, the security risks and issues in such algorithms remain largely unexplored. To facilitate and motivate further research on these critical challenges, this paper presents a foundational treatment of the security problem in DRL. We formulate the security requirements of DRL, and provide a high-level threat model through the classification and identification of vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and adversarial capabilities. Furthermore, we present a review of current literature on security of deep RL from both offensive and defensive perspectives.

We call this attack Ambient Tactical Deception (ATD). Ambient, in artificial intelligence, describes software that is \"unobtrusive,\" and completely integrated into a user's life. Tactical deception is an information warfare term for the use of deception on an opposing force. We suggest that an ATD attack could change the sentiment of text in a web browser. This could alter the victim's perception of reality by providing disinformation. Within the limit of online communication, even a pause in replying to a text can affect how people perceive each other. The outcomes of an ATD attack could include alienation, upsetting a victim, and influencing their feelings about an election, a spouse, or a corporation.",

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity attacks in Cloud data centres are increasing alongside the growth of the Cloud services market. Existing research proposes a number of anomaly detection systems for detecting such attacks. However, these systems encounter a number of challenges, specifically due to the unknown behaviour of the attacks and the occurrence of genuine Cloud workload spikes, which must be distinguished from attacks. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and investigate the issues with the existing Cloud anomaly detection approaches. Then, we propose a Real-time Anomaly Detection System (RADS) for Cloud data centres, which uses a one class classification algorithm and a window-based time series analysis to address the challenges. Specifically, RADS can detect VM-level anomalies occurring due to DDoS and cryptomining attacks. We evaluate the performance of RADS by running lab-based experiments and by using real-world Cloud workload traces. Evaluation results demonstrate that RADS can achieve 90-95% accuracy with a low false positive rate of 0-3%. The results further reveal that RADS experiences fewer false positives when using its window-based time series analysis in comparison to using state-of-the-art average or entropy based analysis.",

For such programs to succeed, data needs to be collected, validated, and recorded in relevant datastores. One potential source supplying these datastores is an organization's security incident response team. However, researchers have argued that these teams focus more on eradication and recovery and less on providing feedback to enhance organizational security. This prompts the idea that data collected during security incident investigations may be of insufficient quality for threat intelligence analysis. While previous discussions focus on data quality issues from threat intelligence sharing perspectives, minimal research examines the data generated during incident response investigations. This paper presents the results of a case study identifying data quality challenges in a Fortune 500 organization's incident response team.

We propose a RISC-V-based hardware-assisted deobfuscation technique that deobfuscates code at runtime based on a secret safely stored in hardware, along with an LLVM compiler extension for obfuscating binaries. Unlike conventional tools, our work does not rely on compiling hard-to-reverse-engineer code, but on securing a secret key.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models, especially neural network (NN) classifiers, are widely used in many applications including natural language processing, computer vision and cybersecurity. They provide high accuracy under the assumption of attack-free scenarios. However, this assumption has been defied by the introduction of adversarial examples -- carefully perturbed samples of input that are usually misclassified. Many researchers have tried to develop a defense against adversarial examples; however, we are still far from achieving that goal. In this paper, we design a Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) based adversarial training defense, dubbed GanDef, which utilizes a competition game to regulate the feature selection during the training. We analytically show that GanDef can train a classifier so it can defend against adversarial examples. Through extensive evaluation on different white-box adversarial examples, the classifier trained by GanDef shows the same level of test accuracy as those trained by state-of-the-art adversarial training defenses. More importantly, GanDef-Comb, a variant of GanDef, could utilize the discriminator to achieve a dynamic trade-off between correctly classifying original and adversarial examples. As a result, it achieves the highest overall test accuracy when the ratio of adversarial examples exceeds 41.7%.",

Many new attacks tend to be modificationsof existing ones. In such a scenario, rule-based systems fail to detectthe attack, even though there are minor differences in conditions /attributes between rules to identify the new and existing attack. Todetect these differences the IDS must be able to isolate the subset ofconditions that are true and predict the likely conditions (differentfrom the original) that must be observed.

In this paper, we study the vulnerability of a class of load forecasting algorithms and analyze the potential impact on the power system operations, such as load shedding and increased dispatch costs. Specifically, we propose data injection attack algorithms that require minimal assumptions on the ability of the adversary. The attacker does not need to have knowledge about the load forecasting model or the underlying power system. Surprisingly, our results indicate that standard load forecasting algorithms are quite vulnerable to the designed black-box attacks. By only injecting malicious data in temperature from online weather forecast APIs, an attacker could manipulate load forecasts in arbitrary directions and cause significant and targeted damages to system operations.",

However, current diffusion models cannot capture transmissions occurring for indirect interactions. For example, an airborne infected individual releases infectious particles at locations that can suspend in the air and infect susceptible individuals arriving even after the infected individual left. Thus, current diffusion models miss transmissions during indirect interactions. In this thesis, a novel diffusion model called the same place different time transmission based diffusion (SPDT) is introduced to take into account the transmissions through indirect interactions. The behaviour of SPDT diffusion is analysed on real dynamic contact networks and a significant amplification in diffusion dynamics is observed. The SPDT model also introduces some novel behaviours different from current diffusion models. In this work, a new SPDT graph model is also developed to generate synthetic traces to explore SPDT diffusion in several scenarios. The analysis shows that the emergence of new diffusion becomes common thanks to the inclusion of indirect transmissions within the SPDT model. This work finally investigates how diffusion can be controlled and develops new methods to hinder diffusion.",

Blockchain technology has the potential to alleviate these concerns: it can support the ability for users to control the custody of their own identifiers and credentials, enabling novel data ownership and governance models with built-in control and consent mechanisms. Hence, blockchain-based IDMSs, which could benefit both users and businesses, are beginning to proliferate.

Despite considerable research in mitigation systems, attackers continually improve their modus operandi by using sophisticated machine learning, natural language processing techniques with an intent to launch successful targeted attacks aimed at deceiving detection mechanisms as well as the victims. We propose a system for advanced email masquerading attacks using Natural Language Generation (NLG) techniques. Using legitimate as well as an influx of varying malicious content, the proposed deep learning system generates \\textit{fake} emails with malicious content, customized depending on the attacker's intent. The system leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for automated text generation. We also focus on the performance of the generated emails in defeating statistical detectors, and compare and analyze the emails using a proposed baseline.",

    "abstract": "Applying security as a lifecycle practice is becoming increasingly important to combat targeted attacks in safety-critical systems. Among others there are two significant challenges in this area: (1) the need for models that can characterize a realistic system in the absence of an implementation and (2) an automated way to associate attack vector information; that is, historical data, to such system models. We propose the cybersecurity body of knowledge (CYBOK), which takes in sufficiently characteristic models of systems and acts as a search engine for potential attack vectors. CYBOK is fundamentally an algorithmic approach to vulnerability exploration, which is a significant extension to the body of knowledge it builds upon. By using CYBOK, security analysts and system designers can work together to assess the overall security posture of systems early in their lifecycle, during major design decisions and before final product designs. Consequently, assisting in applying security earlier and throughout the systems lifecycle.",

The paper also illustrates the application of this theory to the development of four prototype cognitive agents in domains that are critical to the government and the public sector. Two agents function as cognitive assistants, one in intelligence analysis, and the other in science education. The other two agents operate autonomously, one in cybersecurity and the other in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new gait segmentation method based on accelerometer data and develop a new distance function between two time series, showing novel and effectiveness in simultaneously identifying user and adversary. Comparing with the normally used Neural Network methods, our approaches use geometric features to extract walking cycles more precisely and employ a new similarity metric to conduct user-adversary identification. This new technology for simultaneously identify user and adversary contributes to cybersecurity beyond user-only identification. In particular, the new technology is being applied to cell phone recorded walking data and performs an accuracy of $98.79\\%$ for 6 classes classification (user-adversary identification) and $99.06\\%$ for binary classification (user only identification). In addition to walking signal, our approach works on walking up, walking down and mixed walking signals. This technology is feasible for both large and small data set, overcoming the current challenges facing to Neural Networks such as tuning large number of hyper-parameters for large data sets and lacking of training data for small data sets. In addition, the new distance function developed here can be applied in any signal analysis.",

The principal's problem can be modeled as one of predicting future states of variables in a dynamic Bayes network, and we show that, while theoretically the principal's decisions can be made arbitrarily bad, the optimal attack is NP-hard to approximate, even under strong assumptions favoring the attacker. However, we also describe an important special case where the dependency of future states on past states is additive, in which we can efficiently compute an approximately optimal attack. Moreover, in networks with a linear transition function we can solve the problem optimally in polynomial time.",

This increasing sophistication and complexity call for more advancement and continuous innovation in defensive strategies. Traditional methods of intrusion detection and deep packet inspection, while still largely used and recommended, are no longer sufficient to meet the demands of growing security threats. As computing power increases and cost drops, Machine Learning is seen as an alternative method or an additional mechanism to defend against malwares, botnets, and other attacks. This paper explores Machine Learning as a viable solution by examining its capabilities to classify malicious traffic in a network. First, a strong data analysis is performed resulting in 22 extracted features from the initial Netflow datasets. All these features are then compared with one another through a feature selection process. Then, our approach analyzes five different machine learning algorithms against NetFlow dataset containing common botnets. The Random Forest Classifier succeeds in detecting more than 95% of the botnets in 8 out of 13 scenarios and more than 55% in the most difficult datasets. Finally, insight is given to improve and generalize the results, especially through a bootstrapping technique.",

This type of AI-based cybersecurity attack, targeting at GUI systems, is explored in this paper. It is twofold: (1) A malware is designed to attack the existing GUI system by using AI-based object recognition techniques. (2) Its defensive methods are discovered by generating adversarial examples and other methods to alleviate the threats from the intelligent GUI attack.

    "abstract": "In cyberattack detection and prevention systems, cybersecurity analysts always prefer solutions that are as interpretable and understandable as rule-based or signature-based detection. This is because of the need to tune and optimize these solutions to mitigate and control the effect of false positives and false negatives. Interpreting machine learning models is a new and open challenge. However, it is expected that an interpretable machine learning solution will be domain-specific. For instance, interpretable solutions for machine learning models in healthcare are different than solutions in malware detection. This is because the models are complex, and most of them work as a black-box. Recently, the increased ability for malware authors to bypass antimalware systems has forced security specialists to look to machine learning for creating robust detection systems. If these systems are to be relied on in the industry, then, among other challenges, they must also explain their predictions. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the current state-of-the-art ML models interpretability techniques when applied to ML-based malware detectors. We demonstrate interpretability techniques in practice and evaluate the effectiveness of existing interpretability techniques in the malware analysis domain.",

The small changes in the brightness are invisible to humans but can be recovered from video streams taken by cameras such as a local security camera, smartphone camera or a webcam. We present related work and discuss the technical and scientific background of this covert channel.

Two types of attacks: 1) injection attack and 2) scale attack are considered for evaluation. Two evaluation criteria reflecting the damage on system stability and power generation are used to quantify system loss under cyber attacks. Through a sensitivity-based method and attack tree models, the vulnerability of different LFC components is ranked. In addition, a post-intrusion cyber attack detection scheme is proposed.

Unfortunately, this information is often hidden within human-readable textual reports and must be extracted manually.

    "abstract": "The Tor darknet hosts different types of illegal content, which are monitored by cybersecurity agencies. However, manually classifying Tor content can be slow and error-prone. To support this task, we introduce Frequency-Dominant Neighborhood Structure (F-DNS), a new perceptual hashing method for automatically classifying domains by their screenshots. First, we evaluated F-DNS using images subject to various content preserving operations. We compared them with their original images, achieving better correlation coefficients than other state-of-the-art methods, especially in the case of rotation. Then, we applied F-DNS to categorize Tor domains using the Darknet Usage Service Images-2K (DUSI-2K), a dataset with screenshots of active Tor service domains. Finally, we measured the performance of F-DNS against an image classification approach and a state-of-the-art hashing method. Our proposal obtained 98.75% accuracy in Tor images, surpassing all other methods compared.",

Yet progress has often been slow, in part due to a number of unique difficulties with the task that occur through all stages of the developing a machine learning system: data collection, labeling, feature creation and selection, model selection, and evaluation. In this survey we will review a number of the current methods and challenges related to malware classification, including data collection, feature extraction, and model construction, and evaluation. Our discussion will include thoughts on the constraints that must be considered for machine learning based solutions in this domain, and yet to be tackled problems for which machine learning could also provide a solution. This survey aims to be useful both to cybersecurity practitioners who wish to learn more about how machine learning can be applied to the malware problem, and to give data scientists the necessary background into the challenges in this uniquely complicated space.",

Previous studies in this area have either failed to handle encrypted content or achieve stable performance in different environments. To tackle both problems, we present a novel host-level signature based approach to detecting encrypted malicious traces, MBTree. MBTree enhances the evil behavior representation and detection ability by integrating multiple related traces with a corresponding similarity based matching strategy. Compared with previous related studies, MBTree (i) is more accurate to characterize different types of encryption RATs; (ii) has more robust performance, mainly when new benign applications emerged in the test environment; (iii) can automatically create trace signatures when given pure C&C traffic. For evaluation, we collect the malicious traces generated from several famous open source RAT. These traces are reorganized in a sophisticated manner with other available datasets for a comprehensive assessment. The experimental results demonstrate that MBTree is more robust and precise in detecting malicious traces with low false alarm rates, especially in new emerging applications.",

    "abstract": "Social bots have emerged over the last decade, initially creating a nuisance while more recently used to intimidate journalists, sway electoral events, and aggravate existing social fissures. This social threat has spawned a bot detection algorithms race in which detection algorithms evolve in an attempt to keep up with increasingly sophisticated bot accounts. This cat and mouse cycle has illuminated the limitations of supervised machine learning algorithms, where researchers attempt to use yesterday's data to predict tomorrow's bots. This gap means that researchers, journalists, and analysts daily identify malicious bot accounts that are undetected by state of the art supervised bot detection algorithms. These analysts often desire to find similar bot accounts without labeling/training a new model, where similarity can be defined by content, network position, or both. A similarity based algorithm could complement existing supervised and unsupervised methods and fill this gap. To this end, we present the Bot-Match methodology in which we evaluate social media embeddings that enable a semi-supervised recursive nearest neighbors search to map an emerging social cybersecurity threat given one or more seed accounts.",

We interviewed 10 older adults above 65 and 10 adults assisting them based in Singapore to investigate how smartphone P & S can be redesigned inclusively by addressing the needs of older adults and people who support them. Our results show that socio-cultural factors affected the process of getting or providing P & S help, culture and attitude affected learning behaviours and older adults expressed heterogeneous P & S preferences based on contextual factors and level of convenience, however there are opportunities for the mechanisms to be senior-friendly.

To overcome authentication-related protocol issues, we present a bolt-on security extension that can be implemented on Distributed Network Protocol v3 (DNP3).

With the arrival of electric vehicles, various challenges and opportunities are being presented in the electric power system worldwide. For example, under the traditional electric power billing scheme, electric power has to be consumed where it is needed so that end-users could not charge their electric vehicles at different points (e.g. a relative's house) if this the correct user is not billed (this due to the high consumption of electrical energy that makes it expensive). To achieve electric mobility, they must solve new challenges, such as the smart metering of energy consumption and the cybersecurity of these measurements.

This paper proposes an idea for a framework that combines cyber deception, automatic tripwire injection and attack graphs, which eventually enables us to reconstruct multi-step cyber attacks in modern cloud environments.",

This data-driven framework considers the temporal behavior of a generic physical system that extracts features from the time series of the sensor measurements that can be used for detecting covert attacks, distinguishing them from equipment faults, as well as localize the attack/fault.

The challenges are exacerbated with increased adoption of device-to-device (d2d) communication in critical infrastructures. Existing d2d authentication protocols proposed in the literature are either prone to subversion or are computationally infeasible to be deployed on constrained IoT devices. In view of these challenges, we propose a novel, lightweight, and secure CA protocol that leverages communication channel properties and a tunable mathematical function to generate dynamically changing session keys. Our preliminary informal protocol analysis suggests that the proposed protocol is resistant to known attack vectors and thus has strong potential for deployment in securing critical and resource-constrained d2d communication.",

To defend against this new attack method that can cause significant harm, in this paper, we borrow the \"honeypot\" concept from the cybersecurity community and propose DARCY, a honeypot-based defense framework. DARCY adaptively searches and injects multiple trapdoors into an NN model to \"bait and catch\" potential attacks. Through comprehensive experiments across four public datasets, we demonstrate that DARCY detects UniTrigger's adversarial attacks with up to 99% TPR and less than 1% FPR in most cases, while losing the prediction accuracy (in F1) for clean inputs by less than 1% on average.

The proposed MCGDM algorithm aggregates the data, determines the optimal weights for criteria and ranks alternatives with no further input. The intervals give flexibility to experts in assessing alternatives against criteria and provide an opportunity to gain maximum information. We also propose a novel method to aggregate expert judgements using cloud models. We introduce an experimental approach to check the validity of the aggregation method. After that, we use the aggregation method for an MCGDM problem. Here, we find the optimal weights for each criterion by proposing a bilevel optimisation model. Then, we extend the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for data based on cloud models to prioritise alternatives. As a result, the algorithm can gain information from decision makers with different levels of uncertainty and examine alternatives with no more information from decision-makers. The proposed MCGDM algorithm is implemented on a case study of a cybersecurity problem to illustrate its feasibility and effectiveness. The results verify the robustness and validity of the proposed MCGDM using sensitivity analysis and comparison with other existing algorithms.",

We show that a DeMorgan circuit is hazard-free if and only if the circuit produces (purely syntactically) all prime implicants as well as all prime implicates of the Boolean function it computes. This extends to arbitrary DeMorgan circuits a classical result of Eichelberger [IBM J. Res. Develop., 9 (1965)] showing this property for special depth-two circuits. Via an amazingly simple proof, we also strengthen a recent result Ikenmeyer et al. [J. ACM, 66:4 (2019)]: not only the complexities of hazard-free and monotone circuits for monotone Boolean functions do coincide, but every optimal hazard-free circuit for a monotone Boolean function must be monotone. Then we show that hazard-free circuit complexity of a very simple (non-monotone) Boolean function is super-polynomially larger than its unrestricted circuit complexity. This function accepts a Boolean n x n matrix iff every row and every column has exactly one 1-entry. Finally, we show that every Boolean function of n variables can be computed by a hazard-free circuit of size O(2^n/n).",

Through connectivity, CAVs affect their environments and vice versa, increasing the size of the cyberattack surface and the risk of exploitation of security vulnerabilities by malicious actors. Thus, greater understanding of potential CAV-CPS cyberattacks and of ways to prevent them is a high priority.

    "abstract": "A significant limitation of current cyber security research and techniques is its reactive and applied nature. This leads to a continuous 'cyber cycle' of attackers scanning networks, developing exploits and attacking systems, with defenders detecting attacks, analyzing exploits and patching systems. This reactive nature leaves sensitive systems highly vulnerable to attack due to un-patched systems and undetected exploits. Some current research attempts to address this major limitation by introducing systems that implement moving target defense. However, these ideas are typically based on the intuition that a moving target defense will make it much harder for attackers to find and scan vulnerable systems, and not on theoretical mathematical foundations. The continuing lack of fundamental science and principles for developing more secure systems has drawn increased interest into establishing a 'science of cyber security'. This paper introduces the concept of using cybernetics, an interdisciplinary approach of control theory, systems theory, information theory and game theory applied to regulatory systems, as a foundational approach for developing cyber security principles. It explores potential applications of cybernetics to cyber security from a defensive perspective, while suggesting the potential use for offensive applications. Additionally, this paper introduces the fundamental principles for building non-stationary systems, which is a more general solution than moving target defenses. Lastly, the paper discusses related works concerning the limitations of moving target defense and one implementation based on non-stationary principles.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Classifiers deployed in the real world operate in a dynamic environment, where the data distribution can change over time. These changes, referred to as concept drift, can cause the predictive performance of the classifier to drop over time, thereby making it obsolete. To be of any real use, these classifiers need to detect drifts and be able to adapt to them, over time. Detecting drifts has traditionally been approached as a supervised task, with labeled data constantly being used for validating the learned model. Although effective in detecting drifts, these techniques are impractical, as labeling is a difficult, costly and time consuming activity. On the other hand, unsupervised change detection techniques are unreliable, as they produce a large number of false alarms. The inefficacy of the unsupervised techniques stems from the exclusion of the characteristics of the learned classifier, from the detection process. In this paper, we propose the Margin Density Drift Detection (MD3) algorithm, which tracks the number of samples in the uncertainty region of a classifier, as a metric to detect drift. The MD3 algorithm is a distribution independent, application independent, model independent, unsupervised and incremental algorithm for reliably detecting drifts from data streams. Experimental evaluation on 6 drift induced datasets and 4 additional datasets from the cybersecurity domain demonstrates that the MD3 approach can reliably detect drifts, with significantly fewer false alarms compared to unsupervised feature based drift detectors. The reduced false alarms enables the signaling of drifts only when they are most likely to affect classification performance. As such, the MD3 approach leads to a detection scheme which is credible, label efficient and general in its applicability.",

    "abstract": "Modern information and communication technologies used by smart grids are subject to cybersecurity threats. This paper studies the impact of integrity attacks on real-time pricing (RTP), a key feature of smart grids that uses such technologies to improve system efficiency. Recent studies have shown that RTP creates a closed loop formed by the mutually dependent real-time price signals and price-taking demand. Such a closed loop can be exploited by an adversary whose objective is to destabilize the pricing system. Specifically, small malicious modifications to the price signals can be iteratively amplified by the closed loop, causing inefficiency and even severe failures such as blackouts. This paper adopts a control-theoretic approach to deriving the fundamental conditions of RTP stability under two broad classes of integrity attacks, namely, the scaling and delay attacks. We show that the RTP system is at risk of being destabilized only if the adversary can compromise the price signals advertised to smart meters by reducing their values in the scaling attack, or by providing old prices to over half of all consumers in the delay attack. The results provide useful guidelines for system operators to analyze the impact of various attack parameters on system stability, so that they may take adequate measures to secure RTP systems.",

With respect to routing networks, route hijacking has highlighted the need to reexamine the existing protocols that govern traffic routing. In particular, our pri- mary question is how the topology of a network affects the susceptibility of a routing protocol to endogenous route misdirection. In this paper we define and analyze an abstract model of traffic interception (i.e. eavesdropping) in distance-vector routing networks. Specifically, we study al- gorithms that measure the potential of groups of dishonest agents to divert traffic through their infrastructure under the constraint that messages must reach their intended destinations. We relate two variants of our model based on the allowed kinds of lies, define strategies for colluding agents, and prove optimality in special cases. In our main theorem we derive a provably optimal monitoring strategy for subsets of agents in which no two are adjacent, and we extend this strategy to the general case. Finally, we use our results to analyze the susceptibility of real and synthetic networks to endogenous traffic interception. In the Autonomous Systems (AS) graph of the United States, we show that compromising only 18 random nodes in the AS graph surprisingly captures 10% of all traffic paths in the network in expectation when a distance-vector routing protocol is in use.",

However, despite their superior performance in many applications, these models have been recently shown to be susceptible to a particular type of attack possible through the generation of particular synthetic examples referred to as adversarial samples. These samples are constructed by manipulating real examples from the training data distribution in order to \"fool\" the original neural model, resulting in misclassification (with high confidence) of previously correctly classified samples. Addressing this weakness is of utmost importance if deep neural architectures are to be applied to critical applications, such as those in the domain of cybersecurity. In this paper, we present an analysis of this fundamental flaw lurking in all neural architectures to uncover limitations of previously proposed defense mechanisms. More importantly, we present a unifying framework for protecting deep neural models using a non-invertible data transformation--developing two adversary-resilient architectures utilizing both linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Empirical results indicate that our framework provides better robustness compared to state-of-art solutions while having negligible degradation in accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, traditional cybersecurity safeguards have proven ineffective against insider threats. Famous cases of sensitive information leaks caused by insiders, including the WikiLeaks release of diplomatic cables and the Edward Snowden incident, have greatly harmed the U.S. government's relationship with other governments and with its own citizens. Data Leak Prevention (DLP) is a solution for detecting and preventing information leaks from within an organization's network. However, state-of-art DLP detection models are only able to detect very limited types of sensitive information, and research in the field has been hindered due to the lack of available sensitive texts. Many researchers have focused on document-based detection with artificially labeled \"confidential documents\" for which security labels are assigned to the entire document, when in reality only a portion of the document is sensitive. This type of whole-document based security labeling increases the chances of preventing authorized users from accessing non-sensitive information within sensitive documents. In this paper, we introduce Automated Classification Enabled by Security Similarity (ACESS), a new and innovative detection model that penetrates the complexity of big text security classification/detection. To analyze the ACESS system, we constructed a novel dataset, containing formerly classified paragraphs from diplomatic cables made public by the WikiLeaks organization. To our knowledge this paper is the first to analyze a dataset that contains actual formerly sensitive information annotated at paragraph granularity.",

Therefore, educational tools should lead participants to discover technical knowledge in an accessible and attractive framework. In this paper, we present Protection and Deception (P&G), a novel two-player board game. P&G has three main contributions. First, it builds cyber literacy by giving participants \"hands-on\" experience with game pieces that have the capabilities of cyber-attacks such as worms, masquerading attacks/spoofs, replay attacks, and Trojans. Second, P&G teaches the important game-theoretic concepts of asymmetric information and resource allocation implicitly and non-obtrusively through its game play. Finally, it strives for the important objective of security education for underrepresented minorities and people without explicit technical experience. We tested P&G at a community center in Manhattan with middle- and high school students, and observed enjoyment and increased cyber literacy along with suggestions for improvement of the game. Together with these results, our paper also presents images of the attractive board design and 3D printed game pieces, together with a Monte-Carlo analysis that we used to ensure a balanced gaming experience.",

The aim of these services is to facilitate the secure transfer of files in a peer-to- peer (P2P) fashion over the Internet without the need for centralised authentication or storage. These services can take the form of client installed applications or entirely web browser based interfaces. Due to their P2P nature, there is generally no limit to the file sizes involved or to the volume of data transmitted - and where these limitations do exist they will be purely reliant on the capacities of the systems at either end of the transfer. By default, many of these services provide seamless, end-to-end encryption to their users. The cybersecurity and cyberforensic consequences of the potential criminal use of such services are significant. The ability to easily transfer encrypted data over the Internet opens up a range of opportunities for illegal use to cybercriminals requiring minimal technical know-how.

Conventional wisdom favors absence of such patterns due to the overwhelming complexity of the modern cyberspace. Surprisingly, through a detailed analysis of an extensive data set that records the time-dependent frequencies of attacks over a relatively wide range of consecutive IP addresses, we successfully uncover intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns underlying cyberattacks, where the term \"spatio\" refers to the IP address space. In particular, we focus on analyzing {\\em macroscopic} properties of the attack traffic flows and identify two main patterns with distinct spatiotemporal characteristics: deterministic and stochastic. Strikingly, there are very few sets of major attackers committing almost all the attacks, since their attack \"fingerprints\" and target selection scheme can be unequivocally identified according to the very limited number of unique spatiotemporal characteristics, each of which only exists on a consecutive IP region and differs significantly from the others. We utilize a number of quantitative measures, including the flux-fluctuation law, the Markov state transition probability matrix, and predictability measures, to characterize the attack patterns in a comprehensive manner. A general finding is that the attack patterns possess high degrees of predictability, potentially paving the way to anticipating and, consequently, mitigating or even preventing large-scale cyberattacks using macroscopic approaches.",

These comments were labeled as racist or non-racist by multiple annotators. For our approach, three discourse dictionaries were created: first, we created a dictionary by retrieving possibly racist and more neutral terms from the training data, and then augmenting these with more general words to remove some bias. A second dictionary was created through automatic expansion using a \\texttt{word2vec} model trained on a large corpus of general Dutch text. Finally, a third dictionary was created by manually filtering out incorrect expansions. We trained multiple Support Vector Machines, using the distribution of words over the different categories in the dictionaries as features. The best-performing model used the manually cleaned dictionary and obtained an F-score of 0.46 for the racist class on a test set consisting of unseen Dutch comments, retrieved from the same sites used for the training set. The automated expansion of the dictionary only slightly boosted the model's performance, and this increase in performance was not statistically significant. The fact that the coverage of the expanded dictionaries did increase indicates that the words that were automatically added did occur in the corpus, but were not able to meaningfully impact performance. The dictionaries, code, and the procedure for requesting the corpus are available at: https://github.com/clips/hades",

One adventurous proposal is to open the AV platform to third-party developers, so that AV functionalities can be developed in a crowd-sourcing way, which could provide tangible benefits to both automakers and end users. Some pioneering companies in the automotive industry have made the move to open the platform so that developers are allowed to test their code on the road. Such openness, however, brings serious security and safety issues by allowing untrusted code to run on the vehicle. In this paper, we introduce the concept of an Appified AV platform that opens the development framework to third-party developers. To further address the safety challenges, we propose an enhanced appified AV design schema called AVGuard, which focuses primarily on mitigating the threats brought about by untrusted code, leveraging theory in the vehicle evaluation field, and conducting program analysis techniques in the cybersecurity area. Our study provides guidelines and suggested practice for the future design of open AV platforms.",

To classify an input image, a trained network is picked randomly from this set of networks by formulating the interaction between a Defender (who hosts the classification networks) and their (Legitimate and Malicious) users as a Bayesian Stackelberg Game (BSG). We empirically show that this approach, MTDeep, reduces misclassification on perturbed images in various datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, and ImageNet while maintaining high classification accuracy on legitimate test images. We then demonstrate that our framework, being the first meta-defense technique, can be used in conjunction with any existing defense mechanism to provide more resilience against adversarial attacks that can be afforded by these defense mechanisms. Lastly, to quantify the increase in robustness of an ensemble-based classification system when we use MTDeep, we analyze the properties of a set of DNNs and introduce the concept of differential immunity that formalizes the notion of attack transferability.",

    "abstract": "Electric Vehicles (EVs), like all modern vehicles, are entirely controlled by electronic devices embedded within networks that are exposed to the threat of cyberattacks. Cyber vulnerabilities are magnified with EVs due to unique risks associated with EV battery packs. Current batteries have well-known issues with specific energy, cost and fire-related safety risks. In this study, we develop a systematic framework to assess the impact of cyberattacks on EVs. While the current focus of automotive cyberattacks is on short-term physical safety, it is crucial to consider long-term cyberattacks that aim to cause financial losses through accrued impact, especially in the context of EVs. Faulty components of battery management systems such as a compromised voltage regulator could lead to cyberattacks that can overdischarge or overcharge the battery. Overdischarge could lead to failures such as internal shorts in the timescale of minutes through cyberattacks that compromise energy-intensive EV subsystems like auxiliary components. Attacks that overcharge the pack could shorten the lifetime of a new battery pack to less than a year. Further, such attacks also pose physical safety risks via the triggering of thermal (fire) events. Attacks on auxiliary components lead to battery drain, which could be up to 20% of the state-of-charge per hour. Lastly, we develop a heuristic for the stealthiness of a cyberattack to augment traditional threat models. The methodology presented here will help in building the foundational principles of electric vehicle cybersecurity: a nascent but critical topic in the coming years.",

    "abstract": "Cyber defence exercises are intensive, hands-on learning events for teams of professionals who gain or develop their skills to successfully prevent and respond to cyber attacks. The exercises mimic the real-life, routine operation of an organization which is being attacked by an unknown offender. Teams of learners receive very limited immediate feedback from the instructors during the exercise; they can usually see only a scoreboard showing the aggregated gain or loss of points for particular tasks. An in-depth analysis of learners' actions requires considerable human effort, which results in days or weeks of delay. The intensive experience is thus not followed by proper feedback facilitating actual learning, and this diminishes the effect of the exercise. In this initial work, we investigate how to provide valuable feedback to learners right after the exercise without any unnecessary delay. Based on the scoring system of a cyber defence exercise, we have developed a new feedback tool that presents an interactive, personalized timeline of exercise events. We deployed this tool during an international exercise, where we monitored participants' interactions and gathered their reflections. The results show that learners did use the new tool and rated it positively. Since this new feature is not bound to a particular defence exercise, it can be applied to all exercises that employ scoring based on the evaluation of individual exercise objectives. As a result, it enables the learner to immediately reflect on the experience gained.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we aim at building a bridge from poor behavioral data to an effective, quick-response, and robust behavior model for online identity theft detection. We concentrate on this issue in online social networks (OSNs) where users usually have composite behavioral records, consisting of multi-dimensional low-quality data, e.g., offline check-ins and online user generated content (UGC). As an insightful result, we find that there is a complementary effect among different dimensions of records for modeling users' behavioral patterns. To deeply exploit such a complementary effect, we propose a joint model to capture both online and offline features of a user's composite behavior. We evaluate the proposed joint model by comparing with some typical models on two real-world datasets: Foursquare and Yelp. In the widely-used setting of theft simulation (simulating thefts via behavioral replacement), the experimental results show that our model outperforms the existing ones, with the AUC values $0.956$ in Foursquare and $0.947$ in Yelp, respectively. Particularly, the recall (True Positive Rate) can reach up to $65.3\\%$ in Foursquare and $72.2\\%$ in Yelp with the corresponding disturbance rate (False Positive Rate) below $1\\%$. It is worth mentioning that these performances can be achieved by examining only one composite behavior (visiting a place and posting a tip online simultaneously) per authentication, which guarantees the low response latency of our method. This study would give the cybersecurity community new insights into whether and how a real-time online identity authentication can be improved via modeling users' composite behavioral patterns.",

This paper focuses on the allocation of diverse SM and tries to increase the security of the cyber assets located within the electronic security perimeter(ESP) of a substation. We have used a graph-based coloring game in a distributed manner to allocate diverse SM for protecting the cyber assets. The vulnerability assessment for power grid network is also analyzed using this game theoretic method. An improved, diversified SMs for worst-case scenario has been demonstrated by reaching the Nash equilibrium of graph coloring game. As a case study, we analyze the IEEE-14 and IEEE-118 bus system, observe the different distributed coloring algorithm for allocating diverse SM and calculating the overall network criticality.",

    "abstract": "The US Department of Transportation (USDOT) issued a proposed rule on January 12th, 2017 to mandate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) safety communications in light vehicles in the US. Cybersecurity and privacy are major challenges for such a deployment. The authors present a Security Credential Management System (SCMS) for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications in this paper, which has been developed by the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partners LLC (CAMP) under a Cooperative Agreement with the USDOT. This system design is currently transitioning from research to Proof-of-Concept, and is a leading candidate to support the establishment of a nationwide Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for V2X security. It issues digital certificates to participating vehicles and infrastructure nodes for trustworthy communications among them, which is necessary for safety and mobility applications that are based on V2X communications. The main design goal is to provide both security and privacy to the largest extent reasonable and possible. To achieve a reasonable level of privacy in this context, vehicles are issued pseudonym certificates, and the generation and provisioning of those certificates are divided among multiple organizations. Given the large number of pseudonym certificates per vehicle, one of the main challenges is to facilitate efficient revocation of misbehaving or malfunctioning vehicles, while preserving privacy against attacks from insiders. The proposed SCMS supports all identified V2X use-cases and certificate types necessary for V2X communication security. This paper is based upon work supported by the USDOT.

    "abstract": "The increasing scale and sophistication of cyberattacks has led to the adoption of machine learning based classification techniques, at the core of cybersecurity systems. These techniques promise scale and accuracy, which traditional rule or signature based methods cannot. However, classifiers operating in adversarial domains are vulnerable to evasion attacks by an adversary, who is capable of learning the behavior of the system by employing intelligently crafted probes. Classification accuracy in such domains provides a false sense of security, as detection can easily be evaded by carefully perturbing the input samples. In this paper, a generic data driven framework is presented, to analyze the vulnerability of classification systems to black box probing based attacks. The framework uses an exploration exploitation based strategy, to understand an adversary's point of view of the attack defense cycle. The adversary assumes a black box model of the defender's classifier and can launch indiscriminate attacks on it, without information of the defender's model type, training data or the domain of application. Experimental evaluation on 10 real world datasets demonstrates that even models having high perceived accuracy (>90%), by a defender, can be effectively circumvented with a high evasion rate (>95%, on average). The detailed attack algorithms, adversarial model and empirical evaluation, serve.",

The objective of our categorization is to systematize knowledge in insider threat research, while leveraging existing grounded theory method for rigorous literature review. The proposed categorization depicts the workflow among particular categories that include: 1) Incidents and datasets, 2) Analysis of attackers, 3) Simulations, and 4) Defense solutions. Special attention is paid to the definitions and taxonomies of the insider threat; we present a structural taxonomy of insider threat incidents, which is based on existing taxonomies and the 5W1H questions of the information gathering problem. Our survey will enhance researchers' efforts in the domain of insider threat, because it provides: a) a novel structural taxonomy that contributes to orthogonal classification of incidents and defining the scope of defense solutions employed against them, b) an updated overview on publicly available datasets that can be used to test new detection solutions against other works, c) references of existing case studies and frameworks modeling insiders' behaviors for the purpose of reviewing defense solutions or extending their coverage, and d) a discussion of existing trends and further research directions that can be used for reasoning in the insider threat domain.",

This study designs a versatile, data-driven cyberattack detection platform for infrastructure systems cybersecurity, with a special demonstration in water sector. A deep generative model with variational inference autonomously learns normal system behavior and detects attacks as they occur. The model can process the natural data in its raw form and automatically discover and learn its representations, hence augmenting system knowledge discovery and reducing the need for laborious human engineering and domain expertise. The proposed model is applied to a simulated cyberattack detection problem involving a drinking water distribution system subject to programmable logic controller hacks, malicious actuator activation, and deception attacks. The model is only provided with observations of the system, such as pump pressure and tank water level reads, and is blind to the internal structures and workings of the water distribution system. The simulated attacks are manifested in the model's generated reproduction probability plot, indicating its ability to discern the attacks. There is, however, need for improvements in reducing false alarms, especially by optimizing detection thresholds. Altogether, the results indicate ability of the model in distinguishing attacks and their repercussions from normal system operation in water distribution systems, and the promise it holds for cyberattack detection in other domains.",

Though the traditional hardware redundancy-based techniques like Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), Quadded (QL) Logic etc. mitigate the risk to some extent, they add huge hardware overhead and are not very effective. Truly polymorphic circuits that are inherently capable of achieving multiple functionalities in a limited footprint could enhance the faultresilience/recovery of the circuits with limited overhead. We demonstrate a novel crosstalk logic based polymorphic circuit approach to achieve compact and efficient fault resilient circuits. We show a range of polymorphic primitive gates and their usage in a functional unit. The functional unit is a single arithmetic circuit that is capable of delivering Multiplication/Sorting/Addition output depending on the control inputs. Using such polymorphic computing units in an ALU would imply that a correct path for functional output is possible even when 2/3rd of the ALU is damaged. Our comparison results with respect to existing polymorphic techniques and CMOS reveal 28% and 62% reduction in transistor count respectively for the same functionalities. In conjunction with fault detection algorithms, the proposed polymorphic circuit concept can be transformative for fault tolerant circuit design directions with minimum overhead.",

This new cybersecurity adversary is known with the name of \"Advanced Persistent Threat\" (APT) and is referred to different organizations that in the last years have been \"in the center of the eye\" due to multiple dangerous and effective attacks targeting financial and politic, news headlines, embassies, critical infrastructures, TV programs, etc. In order to early identify APT related malware, a semi-automatic approach for malware samples analysis is needed. In our previous work we introduced a \"malware triage\" step for a semi-automatic malware analysis architecture. This step has the duty to analyze as fast as possible new incoming samples and to immediately dispatch the ones that deserve a deeper analysis, among all the malware delivered per day in the cyber-space, the ones that really worth to be further examined by analysts. Our paper focuses on malware developed by APTs, and we build our knowledge base, used in the triage, on known APTs obtained from publicly available reports. In order to have the triage as fast as possible, we only rely on static malware features, that can be extracted with negligible delay, and use machine learning techniques for the identification. In this work we move from multiclass classification to a group of oneclass classifier, which simplify the training and allows higher modularity. The results of the proposed framework highlight high performances, reaching a precision of 100% and an accuracy over 95%",

To train and test the proposed model, we collected and released a large text steganalysis(CT-Steg) dataset, which contains a total number of 216,000 texts with various lengths and various embedding rates. Experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve nearly 100\\% precision and recall, outperforms all the previous methods. Furthermore, the proposed model can even estimate the capacity of the hidden information inside. These results strongly support that using the subtle changes in the semantic space before and after embedding the secret information to conduct text steganalysis is feasible and effective.",

In this work, we focus on malware embedded in PDF files as a representative case of such an arms race. We start by providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the different approaches used to generate PDF malware, and of the corresponding learning-based detection systems. We then categorize threats specifically targeted against learning-based PDF malware detectors, using a well-established framework in the field of adversarial machine learning. This framework allows us to categorize known vulnerabilities of learning-based PDF malware detectors and to identify novel attacks that may threaten such systems, along with the potential defense mechanisms that can mitigate the impact of such threats.

    "abstract": "The objectives of cyberattacks are becoming sophisticated, and attackers are concealing their identity by masquerading as other attackers. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is gaining attention as a way to collect meaningful knowledge to better understand the intention of an attacker and eventually predict future attacks. A systemic threat analysis based on data acquired from actual cyber incidents is a useful approach to generating intelligence for such an objective. Developing an analysis technique requires a high volume and fine quality data. However, researchers can become discouraged by an inaccessibility to data because organizations rarely release their data to the research community. Owing to a data inaccessibility issue, academic research tends to be biased toward techniques that develope steps of the CTI process other than analysis and production. In this paper, we propose an automated dataset generation system called CTIMiner. The system collects threat data from publicly available security reports and malware repositories. The data are stored in a structured format. We released the source codes and dataset to the public, including approximately 640,000 records from 612 security reports published from January 2008 to June 2019. In addition, we present a statistical feature of the dataset and techniques that can be developed using it. Moreover, we demonstrate an application example of the dataset that analyzes the correlation and characteristics of an incident. We believe our dataset will promote collaborative research on threat analysis for the generation of CTI.",

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity and privacy are of the utmost importance for safe, reliable operation of the electric grid. It is well known that the increased connectivity/interoperability between all stakeholders (e.g., utilities, suppliers, and consumers) will enable personal information collection. Significant advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) deployment and demand response (DR) programs across the country, while enable enhanced automation, also generate energy data on individual consumers that can potentially be used for exploiting privacy. Inspired by existing works which consider DR, battery-based perturbation, and differential privacy noise adding, we novelly consider the aggregator (cluster) level privacy issue in the DR framework of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation following. Different from most of the existing works which mainly rely on the charging/discharging scheduling of rechargeable batteries, we utilize controllable building loads to serve as virtual storage devices to absorb a large portion of the PV generation while delicately keeping desired noisy terms to satisfy the differential privacy for the raw load profiles at the aggregator level. This not only ensures differential privacy, but also improves the DR efficiency in load following since part of the noisy signal in solar PV generation has been filtered out. In particular, a mixed integer quadratic optimization problem is formulated to optimally dispatch a population of on/off controllable loads to achieve this privacy preserving DR service.",

    "abstract": "Technology is shaping our lives in a multitude of ways. This is fuelled by a technology infrastructure, both legacy and state of the art, composed of a heterogeneous group of hardware, software, services and organisations. Such infrastructure faces a diverse range of challenges to its operations that include security, privacy, resilience, and quality of services. Among these, cybersecurity and privacy are taking the centre-stage, especially since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. Traditional security and privacy techniques are overstretched and adversarial actors have evolved to design exploitation techniques that circumvent protection. With the ever-increasing complexity of technology infrastructure, security and privacy-preservation specialists have started to look for adaptable and flexible protection methods that can evolve (potentially autonomously) as the adversarial actor changes its techniques. For this, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) were put forward as saviours. In this paper, we look at the promises of AI, ML, and DL stated in academic and industrial literature and evaluate how realistic they are. We also put forward potential challenges a DL based security and privacy protection technique has to overcome. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion on what steps the DL and the security and privacy-preservation community have to take to ensure that DL is not just going to be hype, but an opportunity to build a secure, reliable, and trusted technology infrastructure on which we can rely on for so much in our lives.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of the behaviour of individuals and entities (UEBA) is an area of artificial intelligence that detects hostile actions (e.g. attacks, fraud, influence, poisoning) due to the unusual nature of observed events, by affixing to a signature-based operation. A UEBA process usually involves two phases, learning and inference. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) available still suffer from bias, including over-simplification of problems, underexploitation of the AI potential, insufficient consideration of the temporality of events, and perfectible management of the memory cycle of behaviours. In addition, while an alert generated by a signature-based IDS can refer to the signature on which the detection is based, the IDS in the UEBA domain produce results, often associated with a score, whose explainable character is less obvious. Our unsupervised approach is to enrich this process by adding a third phase to correlate events (incongruities, weak signals) that are presumed to be linked together, with the benefit of a reduction of false positives and negatives. We also seek to avoid a so-called \"boiled frog\" bias inherent in continuous learning. Our first results are interesting and have an explainable character, both on synthetic and real data.",

The basic problem of computing structural properties such as counting triangles and other subgraphs has found applications in diverse domains. Recent biological, social, cybersecurity and sensor network applications have motivated solving such problems on massive networks with billions of vertices. The larger subgraph problem is known to be memory bounded and computationally challenging to scale; the complexity grows both as a function of T and G. In this paper, we study the non-induced tree subgraph counting problem, propose a novel layered softwarehardware co-design approach, and implement a shared-memory multi-threaded algorithm: 1) reducing the complexity of the parallel color-coding algorithm by identifying and pruning redundant graph traversal; 2) achieving a fully-vectorized implementation upon linear algebra kernels inspired by GraphBLAS, which significantly improves cache usage and maximizes memory bandwidth utilization. Experiments show that our implementation improves the overall performance over the state-of-the-art work by orders of magnitude and up to 660x for subgraph templates with size over 12 on a dual-socket Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8160 server. We believe our approach using GraphBLAS with optimized sparse linear algebra can be applied to other massive subgraph counting problems and emerging high-memory bandwidth hardware architectures.",

Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin like online transactions. Then we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques and systems.",

    "abstract": "Security practices in large organizations are notoriously difficult to assess. The challenge only increases when organizations turn to third parties to provide technology and business services, which typically require tight network integration and sharing of confidential data, potentially increasing the organization's attack surface. The security maturity of an organization describes how well it mitigates known risks and responds to new threats. Today, maturity is typically assessed with audits and questionnaires, which are difficult to quantify, lack objectivity, and may not reflect current threats. This paper demonstrates how external measurement of an organization can be used to assess the relative quality of security among organizations. Using a large dataset from BitSight(www.bitsight.com), a cybersecurity ratings company, containing 3.2 billion measurements spanning nearly 37,000 organizations collected during calendar year 2015, we show how per-organizational \"risk vectors\" can be constructed that may be related to an organization's overall security posture, or maturity. Using statistical analysis, we then study the correlation between the risk vectors and botnet infections. For example, we find that misconfigured TLS services, publicly available unsecured protocols, and the use of peer-to-peer file sharing correlate with organizations that have increased rates of botnet infections. We argue that the methodology used to identify these correlations can easily be applied to other data to provide a growing picture of organizational security using external measurement.",

    "abstract": "\"Feint Attack\", as a new type of APT attack, has become the focus of attention. It adopts a multi-stage attacks mode which can be concluded as a combination of virtual attacks and real attacks. Under the cover of virtual attacks, real attacks can achieve the real purpose of the attacker, as a result, it often caused huge losses inadvertently. However, to our knowledge, all previous works use common methods such as Causal-Correlation or Cased-based to detect outdated multi-stage attacks. Few attentions have been paid to detect the \"Feint Attack\", because the difficulty of detection lies in the diversification of the concept of \"Feint Attack\" and the lack of professional datasets, many detection methods ignore the semantic relationship in the attack. Aiming at the existing challenge, this paper explores a new method to solve the problem. In the attack scenario, the fuzzy clustering method based on attribute similarity is used to mine multi-stage attack chains. Then we use a few-shot deep learning algorithm (SMOTE&CNN-SVM) and bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network model (Bi-RNN) to obtain the \"Feint Attack\" chains. \"Feint Attack\" is simulated by the real attack inserted in the normal causal attack chain, and the addition of the real attack destroys the causal relationship of the original attack chain. So we used Bi-RNN coding to obtain the hidden feature of \"Feint Attack\" chain. In the end, our method achieved the goal to detect the \"Feint Attack\" accurately by using the LLDoS1.0 and LLDoS2.0 of DARPA2000 and CICIDS2017 of Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are known to solve classification and regression problems by employing a number of epoch and training samples on a large dataset with optimal accuracy. However, that doesn't mean they are attack-proof or unexposed to vulnerabilities. Newly deployed systems particularly on a public environment (i.e public networks) are vulnerable to attacks from various entities. Moreover, published research on deep learning systems (Goodfellow et al., 2014) have determined a significant number of attacks points and a wide array of attack surface that has evidence of exploitation from adversarial examples. Successful exploit on these systems could lead to critical real world repercussions. For instance, (1) an adversarial attack on a self-driving car running a deep reinforcement learning system yields a direct misclassification on humans causing untoward accidents.(2) a self-driving vehicle misreading a red light signal may cause the car to crash to another car (3) misclassification of a pedestrian lane as an intersection lane that could lead to car crashes. This is just the tip of the iceberg, computer vision deployment are not entirely focused on self-driving cars but on many other areas as well - that would have definitive impact on the real-world. These vulnerabilities must be mitigated at an early stage of development. It is imperative to develop and implement baseline security standards at a global level prior to real-world deployment.",

Machine learning is believed to be the promising methodology to solve that problem, numerous models have been proposed but a practical solution is still yet to come, mainly due to the limitation caused by the out-of-date open datasets available. In this paper, we take a deep inspection of the flow-based statistical data generated by CICFlowMeter, with six most popular machine learning classification models for Zero-Day attacks detection. The training dataset CIC-AWS-2018 Dataset contains fourteen types of intrusions, while the testing datasets contains eight different types of attacks. The six classification models are evaluated and cross validated on CIC-AWS-2018 Dataset for their accuracy in terms of false-positive rate, true-positive rate, and time overhead. Testing dataset, including eight novel (or Zero-Day) real-life attacks and benign traffic flows collected in real research production network are used to test the performance of the chosen decision tree classifier. Promising results are received with the accuracy as high as 100% and reasonable time overhead. We argue that with the statistical data collected from CICFlowMeter, simple machine learning models such as the decision tree classification could be able to take charge in detecting Zero-Day attacks.",

    "abstract": "Moving Target Defense (MTD) is an emerging game-changing defense strategy in cybersecurity with the goal of strengthening defenders and conversely puzzling adversaries in a network environment. The successful deployment of an MTD system can be affected by several factors including 1) the effectiveness of the employed technique, 2) the deployment strategy, 3) the cost of the MTD implementation, and 4) the impact yielded by the enforced security policies. Many research efforts have been spent on introducing a variety of MTD techniques which are often evaluated through simulations. Nevertheless, this line of research needs more attention. In particular, the determination of optimal cost and policy analysis and the selection of those policies in an MTD setting is still an open research question. To advance the state-of-the-art of this line of research, this paper introduces an approach based on control theory to model, analyze and select optimal security policies for Moving Target Defense (MTD) deployment strategies. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) scheme is presented to model states of the system from attacking point of view. The employed value iteration method is based on the Bellman optimality equation for optimal policy selection for each state defined in the system. The model is then utilized to analyze the impact of various costs on the optimal policy. The MDP model is then applied to two case studies to evaluate the performance of the model.",

It is widely used in organizations for configuration management and task automation but is also increasingly used by cybercriminals for launching cyberattacks against organizations, mainly because it is pre-installed on Windows machines and exposes strong functionality that may be leveraged by attackers. This makes the problem of detecting malicious PowerShell code both urgent and challenging. Microsoft's Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) allows defending systems to scan all the code passed to scripting engines such as PowerShell prior to its execution. In this work, we conduct the first study of malicious PowerShell code detection using the information made available by AMSI. We present several novel deep-learning based detectors of malicious PowerShell code that employ pretrained contextual embeddings of words from the PowerShell \"language\". A known problem in the cybersecurity domain is that labeled data is relatively scarce in comparison with unlabeled data, making it difficult to devise effective supervised detection of malicious activity of many types. This is also the case with PowerShell code. Our work shows that this problem can be mitigated by learning a pretrained contextual embedding based on unlabeled data. We trained and evaluated our models using real-world data, collected using AMSI from a large antimalware vendor. Our performance analysis establishes that the use of unlabeled data for the embedding significantly improved the performance of our detectors. Our best-performing model uses an architecture that enables the processing of textual signals from both the character and token levels and obtains a true positive rate of nearly 90% while maintaining a low false-positive rate of less than 0.1%.",

Examples include transaction sequences in financial networks, click streams of users in networks of cross-referenced documents, or travel itineraries in transportation networks. To reliably detect anomalies, we must account for the fact that such data contain a large number of independent observations of paths constrained by a graph topology. Moreover, the heterogeneity of real systems rules out frequency-based anomaly detection techniques, which do not account for highly skewed edge and degree statistics. To address this problem, we introduce HYPA, a novel framework for the unsupervised detection of anomalies in large corpora of variable-length temporal paths in a graph. HYPA provides an efficient analytical method to detect paths with anomalous frequencies that result from nodes being traversed in unexpected chronological order.",

Monte-Carlo simulations of the radiation doses map around the laser-foil interaction point are performed using Geant4 General Particle Source code and the particular geometry chosen for the experimental setup. We obtain the map of the radiation dose distribution for high-power laser - thin solid target experiments, considering a cubic geometry of the interaction chamber. The computed radiation dose distribution shows a good agreement with various, previously obtained experimental results, and could be a step towards simulating the radiation environment inside of a spacecraft. To characterize the laser-plasma accelerated protons, we introduce a new method to enhance the measurement resolution of the proton energy spectrum by employing a stack of thin solid detectors, preferably CR-39. Each detector is thinner than the Bragg peak region on the Bragg curve that characterizes the loss of kinetic energy as a function of the particle penetration depth in the detector material. The relevance of this method for space radiation characterization and cybersecurity insurance is highlighted.",

In a case study of real-time mobility data sharing, we demonstrate the performance of BSMD on a 370 nodes blockchain running on heterogeneous and geographically-separated devices communicating on a physical network. We also demonstrate how BSMD ensures the cybersecurity and privacy of individual by safeguarding against spoofing and message interception attacks and providing information access management control.",

    "abstract": "On the path to establishing a global cybersecurity framework where each enterprise shares information about malicious behavior, an important question arises. How can a machine learning representation characterizing a cyber attack on one network be used to detect similar attacks on other enterprise networks if each networks has wildly different distributions of benign and malicious traffic? We address this issue by comparing the results of naively transferring a model across network domains and using CORrelation ALignment, to our novel adversarial Siamese neural network. Our proposed model learns attack representations that are more invariant to each network's particularities via an adversarial approach. It uses a simple ranking loss that prioritizes the labeling of the most egregious malicious events correctly over average accuracy. This is appropriate for driving an alert triage workflow wherein an analyst only has time to inspect the top few events ranked highest by the model. In terms of accuracy, the other approaches fail completely to detect any malicious events when models were trained on one dataset are evaluated on another for the first 100 events. While, the method presented here retrieves sizable proportions of malicious events, at the expense of some training instabilities due in adversarial modeling. We evaluate these approaches using 2 publicly available networking datasets, and suggest areas for future research.",

    "abstract": "The interconnectivity of cyber and physical systems and Internet of things has created ubiquitous concerns of cyber threats for enterprise system managers. It is common that the asset owners and enterprise network operators need to work with cybersecurity professionals to manage the risk by remunerating them for their efforts that are not directly observable. In this paper, we use a principal-agent framework to capture the service relationships between the two parties, i.e., the asset owner (principal) and the cyber risk manager (agent). Specifically, we consider a dynamic systemic risk management problem with asymmetric information where the principal can only observe cyber risk outcomes of the enterprise network rather than directly the efforts that the manager expends on protecting the resources. Under this information pattern, the principal aims to minimize the systemic cyber risks by designing a dynamic contract that specifies the compensation flows and the anticipated efforts of the manager by taking into account his incentives and rational behaviors. We formulate a bi-level mechanism design problem for dynamic contract design within the framework of a class of stochastic differential games. We show that the principal has rational controllability of the systemic risk by designing an incentive compatible estimator of the agent's hidden efforts. We characterize the optimal solution by reformulating the problem as a stochastic optimal control program which can be solved using dynamic programming. We further investigate a benchmark scenario with complete information and identify conditions that yield zero information rent and lead to a new certainty equivalence principle for principal-agent problems. Finally, case studies over networked systems are carried out to illustrate the theoretical results obtained.",

    "abstract": "While the last few decades have witnessed a huge body of work devoted to inference and learning in distributed and decentralized setups, much of this work assumes a non-adversarial setting in which individual nodes---apart from occasional statistical failures---operate as intended within the algorithmic framework. In recent years, however, cybersecurity threats from malicious non-state actors and rogue entities have forced practitioners and researchers to rethink the robustness of distributed and decentralized algorithms against adversarial attacks. As a result, we now have a plethora of algorithmic approaches that guarantee robustness of distributed and/or decentralized inference and learning under different adversarial threat models. Driven in part by the world's growing appetite for data-driven decision making, however, securing of distributed/decentralized frameworks for inference and learning against adversarial threats remains a rapidly evolving research area. In this article, we provide an overview of some of the most recent developments in this area under the threat model of Byzantine attacks.",

    "abstract": "Malware imposes tremendous threats to computer users nowadays. Since signature-based malware detection methods are neither effective nor efficient to identify new malware, many machine learning-based methods have been proposed. A common disadvantage of existing machine learning methods is that they are not based on understanding the full semantic meaning of assembly code of an executable. They rather use short assembly code fragments, because assembly code is usually too long to be modelled in its entirety. Another disadvantage is that those methods have either inferior performance or bad interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Interpretable MAware Detector (I-MAD), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on static malware detection with excellent interpretability. It integrates a hierarchical Transformer network that can understand assembly code at the basic block, function, and executable level. It also integrates our novel interpretable feed-forward neural network to provide interpretations for its detection results by pointing out the impact of each feature with respect to the prediction. Experiment results show that our model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art static malware detection models and presents meaningful interpretations.",

Whether these social media campaigns of the so-called \"troll\" accounts were able to manipulate public opinion is still in question. Here we aim to quantify the influence of troll accounts and the impact they had on Twitter by analyzing 152.5 million tweets from 9.9 million users, including 822 troll accounts. The data collected during the US election campaign, contain original troll tweets before they were deleted by Twitter. From these data, we constructed a very large interaction graph; a directed graph of 9.3 million nodes and 169.9 million edges. Recently, Twitter released datasets on the misinformation campaigns of 8,275 state-sponsored accounts linked to Russia, Iran and Venezuela as part of the investigation on the foreign interference in the 2016 US election. These data serve as ground-truth identifier of troll users in our dataset. Using graph analysis techniques we qualify the diffusion cascades of web and media context that have been shared by the troll accounts. We present strong evidence that authentic users were the source of the viral cascades. Although the trolls were participating in the viral cascades, they did not have a leading role in them and only four troll accounts were truly influential.",

    "abstract": "A new cybersecurity attack,where an adversary illicitly runs crypto-mining software over the devices of unaware users, is emerging in both the literature and in the wild . This attack, known as cryptojacking, has proved to be very effective given the simplicity of running a crypto-client into a target device. Several countermeasures have recently been proposed, with different features and performance, but all characterized by a host-based architecture. This kind of solutions, designed to protect the individual user, are not suitable for efficiently protecting a corporate network, especially against insiders. In this paper, we propose a network-based approach to detect and identify crypto-clients activities by solely relying on the network traffic, even when encrypted. First, we provide a detailed analysis of the real network traces generated by three major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Monero, and Bytecoin, considering both the normal traffic and the one shaped by a VPN. Then, we propose Crypto-Aegis, a Machine Learning (ML) based framework built over the results of our investigation, aimed at detecting cryptocurrencies related activities, e.g., pool mining, solo mining, and active full nodes. Our solution achieves a striking 0.96 of F1-score and 0.99 of AUC for the ROC, while enjoying a few other properties, such as device and infrastructure independence. Given the extent and novelty of the addressed threat we believe that our approach, supported by its excellent results, pave the way for further research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are increasingly embraced around the world to advance smart mobility and more broadly, smart, and sustainable cities. Algorithms form the basis of decision-making in AVs, allowing them to perform driving tasks autonomously, efficiently, and more safely than human drivers and offering various economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, algorithmic decision-making in AVs can also introduce new issues that create new safety risks and perpetuate discrimination. We identify bias, ethics, and perverse incentives as key ethical issues in the AV algorithms' decision-making that can create new safety risks and discriminatory outcomes. Technical issues in the AVs' perception, decision-making and control algorithms, limitations of existing AV testing and verification methods, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities can also undermine the performance of the AV system. This article investigates the ethical and technical concerns surrounding algorithmic decision-making in AVs by exploring how driving decisions can perpetuate discrimination and create new safety risks for the public. We discuss steps taken to address these issues, highlight the existing research gaps and the need to mitigate these issues through the design of AV's algorithms and of policies and regulations to fully realise AVs' benefits for smart and sustainable cities.",

The following IoT devices were investigated: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and Raspberry Pi Zero W. The DS18B20 and INA219 sensors investigated and analyzed the dependence of FTP multimedia data transmission speed on wireless Wi-Fi network on the temperature of the switch processor, temperature. The environment and the current and voltage consumed by the switch. Advantages of sensors with GPIO interface over analog meters for this experiment are revealed. Much of the work is devoted to the development of automation of results from GPIO interfaces, which helped eliminate human error and get more accurate metrics. Measurement automation was developed using Python 3.7 programming language. Using the INA219 library we were able to obtain current and voltage indicators from the ina219 board. To get temperature indicators sufficiently built into Python libraries to read temperature files in Raspbian. The article focuses on the synchronicity of measurement results records for more accurate analysis. Therefore, an FTP client was developed that measures the download speed of the file from the FTP server and records the results simultaneously with temperature, current and voltage measurements. To this end, attention is drawn to the multithreading in Python programming language and the transmission of commands using TCP sockets in that language. As a result, the dependence of the measured factors was calculated using the Pearson correlation formula. These measurement factors affect the autonomy and energy consumption, which is very important for IoT devices, and therefore, among the devices tested, recommendations were made regarding their choice when used depending on the conditions.",

However, as certain variants of malware can provide highly lucrative opportunities for bad actors, significant resources are dedicated to innovations and improvements by vast criminal organisations. Among these forms of malware, ransomware has experienced a significant recent rise as it offers the perpetrators great financial incentive. Ransomware variants operate by removing system access from the user by either locking the system or encrypting some or all of the data, and subsequently demanding payment or ransom in exchange for returning system access or providing a decryption key to the victim. Due to the ubiquity of sensitive data in many aspects of modern life, many victims of such attacks, be they an individual home user or operators of a business, are forced to pay the ransom to regain access to their data, which in many cases does not happen as renormalisation of system operations is never guaranteed. As the problem of ransomware does not seem to be subsiding, it is very important to investigate the underlying forces driving and facilitating such attacks in order to create preventative measures. As such, in this paper, we discuss and provide further insight into variants of ransomware and their victims in order to understand how and why they have been targeted and what can be done to prevent or mitigate the effects of such attacks.",

The dramatic increase of such incidents in recent years and the incalculable damage committed by insiders must serve as a warning for all members of the cyber security community. It is no longer acceptable to continue to underestimate the problem of insider threats. Firms, organizations, institutions and governments need to lead and embrace a cultural change in their security posture. Through the adoption of an Insider Threat Program that engages all the strategic branches (including HR, Legal, Information Assurance, Cyber Security and Intelligence), coordinated by the chief information security officer and supported by c-level executive, it is possible to implement a framework that can prevent, detect, and respond to disloyal and/or unintentional insider threats. Hence, defending your enterprise from insider threats is a vital part of information security best practices. It is essential that your company highly valuable classified data and assets are protected from its greatest threat: the enemy within the gates.",

While datacenter networks can be protected using conventional cybersecurity measures, edge neural networks bring a host of new security challenges. Unlike classic IoT applications, edge neural networks are typically very compute and memory intensive, their execution is data-independent, and they are robust to noise and faults. Neural network models may be very expensive to develop, and can potentially reveal information about the private data they were trained on, requiring special care in distribution. The hidden states and outputs of the network can also be used in reconstructing user inputs, potentially violating users' privacy. Furthermore, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which may cause misclassifications and violate the integrity of the output. These properties add challenges when securing edge-deployed DNNs, requiring new considerations, threat models, priorities, and approaches in securely and privately deploying DNNs to the edge. In this work, we cover the landscape of attacks on, and defenses, of neural networks deployed in edge devices and provide a taxonomy of attacks and defenses targeting edge DNNs.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the buildings where we spend most part of our life are rapidly evolving. They are becoming fully automated environments where energy consumption, access control, heating and many other subsystems are all integrated within a single system commonly referred to as smart building (SB). To support the growing complexity of building operations, building automation systems (BAS) powering SBs are integrating consumer range Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as IP cameras alongside with operational technology (OT) controllers and actuators. However, these changes pose important cybersecurity concerns since the attack surface is larger, attack vectors are increasing and attacks can potentially harm building occupants. In this paper, we analyze the threat landscape of BASs by focusing on subsystems which are strongly affected by the advent of IoT devices such as video surveillance systems and smart lightning. We demonstrate how BAS operation can be disrupted by simple attacks to widely used network protocols. Furthermore, using both known and 0-day vulnerabilities reported in the paper and previously disclosed, we present the first (at our knowledge) BAS-specific malware which is able to persist within the BAS network by leveraging both OT and IoT devices connected to the BAS. Our research highlights how BAS networks can be considered as critical as industrial control systems and security concerns in BASs deserve more attention from both industrial and scientific communities. Even within a simulated environment, our proof-of-concept attacks were carried out with relative ease and a limited amount of budget and resources. Therefore, we believe that well-funded attack groups will increasingly shift their focus towards BASs with the potential of impacting the live of thousands of people.",

However, the related recommendations are typically the same for all organizations and their employees, regardless of the nature and the level of risk for different groups of users. Building upon an existing cybersecurity investment model, this paper presents a tool for optimal selection of cyber hygiene safeguards, which we refer as the Optimal Safeguards Tool. The model combines game theory and combinatorial optimization taking into account the probability of each user group to being attacked, the value of assets accessible by each group, and the efficacy of each control for a particular group. The model considers indirect cost as the time employees could require for learning and training against an implemented control. Utilizing a game-theoretic framework to support the Knapsack optimization problem permits us to optimally select safeguards' application levels minimizing the aggregated expected damage within a security investment budget. We evaluate OST in a healthcare domain use case.

We compare the strategies implemented by OST against alternative common-sense defending approaches for three different types of attackers: Nash, Weighted and Opportunistic. Nash defending strategies are consistently better than the competing strategies for all attacker types with a minor exception where the Nash defending strategy performs at least as good as other common-sense approaches.",

    "abstract": "In the Social Web scenario, large amounts of User-Generated Content (UGC) are diffused through social media often without almost any form of traditional trusted intermediaries. Therefore, the risk of running into misinformation is not negligible. For this reason, assessing and mining the credibility of online information constitutes nowadays a fundamental research issue. Credibility, also referred as believability, is a quality perceived by individuals, who are not always able to discern, with their own cognitive capacities, genuine information from fake one. Hence, in the last years, several approaches have been proposed to automatically assess credibility in social media. Many of them are based on data-driven models, i.e., they employ machine learning techniques to identify misinformation, but recently also model-driven approaches are emerging, as well as graph-based approaches focusing on credibility propagation, and knowledge-based ones exploiting Semantic Web technologies. Three of the main contexts in which the assessment of information credibility has been investigated concern: (i) the detection of opinion spam in review sites, (ii) the detection of fake news in microblogging, and (iii) the credibility assessment of online health-related information. In this article, the main issues connected to the evaluation of information credibility in the Social Web, which are shared by the above-mentioned contexts, are discussed. A concise survey of the approaches and methodologies that have been proposed in recent years to address these issues is also presented.",

ICSs are often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures, such as nuclear and thermal plants, water treatment facilities, power generation, heavy industries, and distribution systems. Though ICSs were kept isolated from the Internet for so long, significant achievable business benefits are driving a convergence between ICSs and the Internet as well as information technology (IT) environments, such as cloud computing. As a result, ICSs have been exposed to the attack vectors used in the majority of cyber-attacks. However, ICS devices are inherently much less secure against such advanced attack scenarios. A compromise to ICS can lead to enormous physical damage and danger to human lives. In this work, we have a close look at the shift of the ICS from stand-alone systems to cloud-based environments. Then we discuss the major works, from industry and academia towards the development of the secure ICSs, especially applicability of the machine learning techniques for the ICS cyber-security. The work may help to address the challenges of securing industrial processes, particularly while migrating them to the cloud environments.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, focus on the security and privacy aspects of implantable medical devices (IMDs) has intensified, driven by the multitude of cybersecurity vulnerabilities found in various existing devices. However, due to their strict computational, energy and physical constraints, conventional security protocols are not directly applicable to IMDs. Custom-tailored schemes have been proposed instead which, however, fail to cover the full spectrum of security features that modern IMDs and their ecosystems so critically require. In this paper we propose IMDfence, a security protocol for IMD ecosystems that provides a comprehensive yet practical security portfolio, which includes availability, non-repudiation, access control, entity authentication, remote monitoring and system scalability. The protocol also allows emergency access that results in the graceful degradation of offered services without compromising security and patient safety. The performance of the security protocol as well as its feasibility and impact on modern IMDs are extensively analyzed and evaluated. We find that IMDfence achieves the above security requirements at a mere less than 7% increase in total IMD energy consumption, and less than 14 ms and 9 kB increase in system delay and memory footprint, respectively.",

Microsoft uses telemetry to periodically collect information about Windows systems and to help improve user experience and fix potential issues. Windows telemetry service functions by creating RBS files on the local system to reliably transfer and manage the telemetry data, and these files can provide useful information in a digital forensic investigation. Combined with the information derived from traditional Windows forensics, investigators can have greater confidence in the evidence derived from various artifacts. It is possible to acquire information that can be confirmed only for live systems, such as the computer hardware serial number, the connection records for external storage devices, and traces of executed processes. This information is included in the RBS files that are created for use in Windows telemetry. In this paper, we introduced how to acquire RBS files telemetry and analyzed the data structure of these RBS files, which are able to determine the types of information that Windows OS have been collected. We also discussed the reliability and the novelty by comparing the conventional artifacts with the RBS files, which could be useful in digital forensic investigation.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, it is imperative to proactively understand the real-world cybersecurity threats posed to them. This paper describes our initial efforts towards building a honeypot ecosystem as a means to gathering and analyzing real attack data against IoT devices. A primary condition for a honeypot to yield useful insights is to let attackers believe they are real systems used by humans and organizations. IoT devices pose unique challenges in this respect, due to the large variety of device types and the physical-connectedness nature. We thus create a multiphased approach in building a honeypot ecosystem, where researchers can gradually increase a low-interaction honeypot's sophistication in emulating an IoT device by observing real-world attackers' behaviors. We deployed honeypots both on-premise and in the cloud, with associated analysis and vetting infrastructures to ensure these honeypots cannot be easily identified as such and appear to be real systems. In doing so we were able to attract increasingly sophisticated attack data. We present the design of this honeypot ecosystem and our observation on the attack data so far. Our data shows that real-world attackers are explicitly going after IoT devices, and some captured activities seem to involve direct human interaction (as opposed to scripted automatic activities). We also build a low interaction honeypot for IoT cameras, called Honeycamera, that present to attackers seemingly real videos. This is our first step towards building a more comprehensive honeypot ecosystem that will allow researchers to gain concrete understanding of what attackers are going after on IoT devices, so as to more proactively protect them.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation and application of machine learning based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have allowed for more flexibility and efficiency in the automated detection of cyber attacks in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). However, the introduction of such IDSs has also created an additional attack vector; the learning models may also be subject to cyber attacks, otherwise referred to as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). Such attacks may have severe consequences in ICS systems, as adversaries could potentially bypass the IDS. This could lead to delayed attack detection which may result in infrastructure damages, financial loss, and even loss of life. This paper explores how adversarial learning can be used to target supervised models by generating adversarial samples using the Jacobian-based Saliency Map attack and exploring classification behaviours. The analysis also includes the exploration of how such samples can support the robustness of supervised models using adversarial training. An authentic power system dataset was used to support the experiments presented herein. Overall, the classification performance of two widely used classifiers, Random Forest and J48, decreased by 16 and 20 percentage points when adversarial samples were present. Their performances improved following adversarial training, demonstrating their robustness towards such attacks.",

Our brains can \"effortlessly\" resolve the first question, but will definitely fail in the second one. Since many fine temporal scale gait patterns surely escape our eyes. Based on accelerometers' 3D gait time series databases, we link the answers toward both questions via multiscale structural dependency within gait dynamics of our musculoskeletal system. Two types of dependency manifestations are explored. We first develop simple algorithmic computing called Principle System-State Analysis (PSSA) for the coarse dependency in implicit forms. PSSA is shown to be able to efficiently classifying among many subjects. We then develop a multiscale Local-1st-Global-2nd (L1G2) Coding Algorithm and a landmark computing algorithm. With both algorithms, we can precisely dissect rhythmic gait cycles, and then decompose each cycle into a series of cyclic gait phases. With proper color-coding and stacking, we reconstruct and represent an individual's gait dynamics via a 3D cylinder to collectively reveal universal deterministic and stochastic structural patterns on centisecond (10 milliseconds) scale across all rhythmic cycles. This 3D cylinder can serve as \"passtensor\" for authentication purposes related to clinical diagnoses and cybersecurity.",

    "abstract": "Malicious domains are increasingly common and pose a severe cybersecurity threat. Specifically, many types of current cyber attacks use URLs for attack communications (e.g., C\\&C, phishing, and spear-phishing). Despite the continuous progress in detecting these attacks, many alarming problems remain open, such as the weak spots of the defense mechanisms. Since machine learning has become one of the most prominent methods of malware detection, A robust feature selection mechanism is proposed that results in malicious domain detection models that are resistant to evasion attacks. This mechanism exhibits high performance based on empirical data. This paper makes two main contributions: First, it provides an analysis of robust feature selection based on widely used features in the literature. Note that even though the feature set dimensional space is reduced by half (from nine to four features), the performance of the classifier is still improved (an increase in the model's F1-score from 92.92\\% to 95.81\\%). Second, it introduces novel features that are robust to the adversary's manipulation. Based on an extensive evaluation of the different feature sets and commonly used classification models, this paper shows that models that are based on robust features are resistant to malicious perturbations, and at the same time useful for classifying non-manipulated data.",

Medical image analysis (MedIA) systems have recently been argued to be particularly vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to strong financial incentives. In this paper, we study several previously unexplored factors affecting adversarial attack vulnerability of deep learning MedIA systems in three medical domains: ophthalmology, radiology and pathology. Firstly, we study the effect of varying the degree of adversarial perturbation on the attack performance and its visual perceptibility. Secondly, we study how pre-training on a public dataset (ImageNet) affects the models' vulnerability to attacks. Thirdly, we study the influence of data and model architecture disparity between target and attacker models. Our experiments show that the degree of perturbation significantly affects both performance and human perceptibility of attacks. Pre-training may dramatically increase the transfer of adversarial examples; the larger the performance gain achieved by pre-training, the larger the transfer. Finally, disparity in data and/or model architecture between target and attacker models substantially decreases the success of attacks. We believe that these factors should be considered when designing cybersecurity-critical MedIA systems, as well as kept in mind when evaluating their vulnerability to adversarial attacks.",

Assessments of the security of maritime shipping systems have focused on identifying risks but have not taken the critical (and expensive) next step of actually identifying vulnerabilities present in these systems. While such risk assessments are important, they have not provided the detailed identification of security issues in the systems that control these ports and their terminals.

We performed an analysis of the information flow involved in the maritime shipping process, and then executed an in-depth vulnerability assessment of the software that manages freight systems. In this paper, we show the flow of information involved in the freight shipping process and explain how we performed the in-depth assessment, summarizing our findings.

Facebook, Twitter, Reddit are among many other networks where users can have this freedom of information sharing. The abundance of information shared over these networks makes them an attractive area for investigating all aspects of human behavior on information dissemination. Among the many interesting behaviors, controversiality within social cascades is of high interest to us. It is known that controversiality is bound to happen within online discussions. The online social network platform Reddit has the feature to tag comments as controversial if the users have mixed opinions about that comment. The difference between this study and previous attempts at understanding controversiality on social networks is that we do not investigate topics that are known to be controversial. On the contrary, we examine typical cascades with comments that the readers deemed to be controversial concerning the matter discussed. This work asks whether controversially initiated information cascades have distinctive characteristics than those not controversial in Reddit. We used data collected from Reddit consisting of around 17 million posts and their corresponding comments related to cybersecurity issues to answer these emerging questions. From the comparative analyses conducted, controversial content travels faster and further from its origin. Understanding this phenomenon would shed light on how users or organization might use it to their help in controlling and spreading a specific beneficiary message.",

This is due to (a) the increased dependency on automated device, and (b) the inadequacy of general purpose Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to be deployed for special purpose networks usage. Numerous lightweight protocols are being proposed for IoT devices communication usage. One of the distinguishable IoT machine-to-machine communication protocols is Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. However, as per the authors best knowledge, there are no available IDS datasets that include MQTT benign or attack instances and thus, no IDS experimental results available. In this paper, the effectiveness of six Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect MQTT-based attacks is evaluated. Three abstraction levels of features are assessed, namely, packet-based, unidirectional flow, and bidirectional flow features. An MQTT simulated dataset is generated and used for the training and evaluation processes. The dataset is released with an open access licence to help the research community further analyse the accompanied challenges. The experimental results demonstrated the adequacy of the proposed ML models to suit MQTT-based networks IDS requirements. Moreover, the results emphasise on the importance of using flow-based features to discriminate MQTT-based attacks from benign traffic, while packet-based features are sufficient for traditional networking attacks.",

For the encapsulation of keys based on the SIDH algorithm, it is proposed to use isogeny of minimal odd degrees 3 and 5, which allows bypassing the problem of singular points of the 2nd and 4th orders, characteristic of 2-isogenies. A review of the main properties of the classes of complete, quadratic, and twisted Edwards curves over a simple field is given. Equations for the isogeny of odd degrees are reduced to a form adapted to curves in the form of Weierstrass. To do this, use the modified law of addition of curve points in the generalized Edwards form, which preserves the horizontal symmetry of the curve return points. Examples of the calculation of 3- and 5-isogenies of complete Edwards supersingular curves over small simple fields are given, and the properties of the isogeny composition for their calculation with large-order kernels are discussed. Equations are obtained for upper complexity estimates for computing isogeny of odd degrees 3 and 5 in the classes of complete and quadratic Edwards curves in projective coordinates; algorithms are constructed for calculating 3- and 5-isogenies of Edwards curves with complexity 6M + 4S and 12M + 5S, respectively.

At the same time, privacy and compliance regulations such as GDPR, the EU ePrivacy regulation, PCI, and the upcoming EU Cybersecurity Act raise the bar for secure processing and traceability of critical data. Especially the demand to provide information about existing data records of an individual and the ability to delete them on demand is central in privacy regulations. Common to these requirements is that cloud providers must be able to track data as it flows across the different services to ensure that it never moves outside of the legitimate realm, and it is known at all times where a specific copy of a record that belongs to a specific individual or business process is located. However, current cloud architectures do neither provide the means to holistically track data flows across different services nor to enforce policies on data flows. In this paper, we point out the deficits in the data flow tracking functionalities of major cloud providers by means of a set of practical experiments. We then generalize from these experiments introducing a generic architecture that aims at solving the problem of cloud-wide data flow tracking and show how it can be built in a Kubernetes-based prototype implementation.",

    "abstract": "The field of cybersecurity has mostly been a cat-and-mouse game with the discovery of new attacks leading the way. To take away an attacker's advantage of reconnaissance, researchers have proposed proactive defense methods such as Moving Target Defense (MTD). To find good movement strategies, researchers have modeled MTD as leader-follower games between the defender and a cyber-adversary. We argue that existing models are inadequate in sequential settings when there is incomplete information about a rational adversary and yield sub-optimal movement strategies. Further, while there exists an array of work on learning defense policies in sequential settings for cyber-security, they are either unpopular due to scalability issues arising out of incomplete information or tend to ignore the strategic nature of the adversary simplifying the scenario to use single-agent reinforcement learning techniques. To address these concerns, we propose (1) a unifying game-theoretic model, called the Bayesian Stackelberg Markov Games (BSMGs), that can model uncertainty over attacker types and the nuances of an MTD system and (2) a Bayesian Strong Stackelberg Q-learning (BSS-Q) approach that can, via interaction, learn the optimal movement policy for BSMGs within a reasonable time. We situate BSMGs in the landscape of incomplete-information Markov games and characterize the notion of Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) in them. We show that our learning approach converges to an SSE of a BSMG and then highlight that the learned movement policy (1) improves the state-of-the-art in MTD for web-application security and (2) converges to an optimal policy in MTD domains with incomplete information about adversaries even when prior information about rewards and transitions is absent.",

    "abstract": "Opacity is a security property formalizing the information leakage of a system to an external observer, namely intruder. The conventional opacity that has been studied in the Discrete Event System (DES) literature usually assumes passive intruders, who only observe the behavior of the system. However, in many cybersecurity concerns, such as web service, active intruders, who are capable of influencing the system's behavior beyond passive observations, need to be considered and defended against. We are therefore motivated to extend the opacity notions to handle active intruders. For this, we model the system as a non-deterministic finite-state transducer. It is assumed that the intruder has a full knowledge of the system structure and is capable of interacting with the system by injecting different inputs and observing its responses. In this setup, we first introduce reactive current-state opacity (RCSO) notion characterizing a property that the system does not leak its secret state regardless of how the intruder manipulates the system behavior. We furthermore extend this notion to language-based and initial-state reactive opacity notions, and study the relationship among them. It turns out that all the proposed reactive opacity notions are equivalent to RCSO. We therefore focus on RCSO and study its verification problem. It is shown that the RCSO can be verified by constructing an observer automaton.",

In particular, DNNs can be designed to have backdoors in which an adversary can easily and reliably fool a classifier by adding to any image a pattern of pixels called a trigger. Since DNNs are black-box algorithms, it is generally difficult to detect a backdoor or any other type of structural malware. To efficiently provide a reliable signal for the absence/presence of backdoors, we propose a rapid feature-generation step in which we study how DNNs respond to noise-infused images with varying noise intensity. This results in titration curves, which are a type of `fingerprinting' for DNNs. We find that DNNs with backdoors are more sensitive to input noise and respond in a characteristic way that reveals the backdoor and where it leads (i.e,. its target). Our empirical results demonstrate that we can accurately detect a backdoor with high confidence orders-of-magnitude faster than existing approaches (i.e., seconds versus hours). Our method also yields a titration-score that can automate the detection of compromised DNNs, whereas existing backdoor-detection strategies are not automated.",

    "abstract": "In the current network-based computing world, where the number of interconnected devices grows exponentially, their diversity, malfunctions, and cybersecurity threats are increasing at the same rate. To guarantee the correct functioning and performance of novel environments such as Smart Cities, Industry 4.0, or crowdsensing, it is crucial to identify the capabilities of their devices (e.g., sensors, actuators) and detect potential misbehavior that may arise due to cyberattacks, system faults, or misconfigurations. With this goal in mind, a promising research field emerged focusing on creating and managing fingerprints that model the behavior of both the device actions and its components. The article at hand studies the recent growth of the device behavior fingerprinting field in terms of application scenarios, behavioral sources, and processing and evaluation techniques. First, it performs a comprehensive review of the device types, behavioral data, and processing and evaluation techniques used by the most recent and representative research works dealing with two major scenarios: device identification and device misbehavior detection. After that, each work is deeply analyzed and compared, emphasizing its characteristics, advantages, and limitations. This article also provides researchers with a review of the most relevant characteristics of existing datasets as most of the novel processing techniques are based on machine learning and deep learning. Finally, it studies the evolution of these two scenarios in recent years, providing lessons learned, current trends, and future research challenges to guide new solutions in the area.",

    "abstract": "Attack graphs are one of the main techniques used to automate the risk assessment process. In order to derive a relevant attack graph, up-to-date information on known attack techniques should be represented as interaction rules. Designing and creating new interaction rules is not a trivial task and currently performed manually by security experts. However, since the number of new security vulnerabilities and attack techniques continuously and rapidly grows, there is a need to frequently update the rule set of attack graph tools with new attack techniques to ensure that the set of interaction rules is always up-to-date. We present a novel, end-to-end, automated framework for modeling new attack techniques from textual description of a security vulnerability. Given a description of a security vulnerability, the proposed framework first extracts the relevant attack entities required to model the attack, completes missing information on the vulnerability, and derives a new interaction rule that models the attack; this new rule is integrated within MulVAL attack graph tool. The proposed framework implements a novel pipeline that includes a dedicated cybersecurity linguistic model trained on the the NVD repository, a recurrent neural network model used for attack entity extraction, a logistic regression model used for completing the missing information, and a novel machine learning-based approach for automatically modeling the attacks as MulVAL's interaction rule. We evaluated the performance of each of the individual algorithms, as well as the complete framework and demonstrated its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19's impact has surpassed from personal and global health to our social life. In terms of digital presence, it is speculated that during pandemic, there has been a significant rise in cyberbullying. In this paper, we have examined the hypothesis of whether cyberbullying and reporting of such incidents have increased in recent times. To evaluate the speculations, we collected cyberbullying related public tweets (N=454,046) posted between January 1st, 2020 -- June 7th, 2020. A simple visual frequentist analysis ignores serial correlation and does not depict changepoints as such. To address correlation and a relatively small number of time points, Bayesian estimation of the trends is proposed for the collected data via an autoregressive Poisson model. We show that this new Bayesian method detailed in this paper can clearly show the upward trend on cyberbullying-related tweets since mid-March 2020. However, this evidence itself does not signify a rise in cyberbullying but shows a correlation of the crisis with the discussion of such incidents by individuals. Our work emphasizes a critical issue of cyberbullying and how a global crisis impacts social media abuse and provides a trend analysis model that can be utilized for social media data analysis in general.",

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity of discrete event systems (DES) has been gaining more and more attention recently, due to its high relevance to the so-called 4th industrial revolution that heavily relies on data communication among networked systems. One key challenge is how to ensure system resilience to sensor and/or actuator attacks, which may tamper data integrity and service availability. In this paper we focus on some key decidability issues related to smart sensor attacks. We first present a sufficient and necessary condition that ensures the existence of a smart sensor attack, which reveals a novel demand-supply relationship between an attacker and a controlled plant, represented as a set of risky pairs. Each risky pair consists of a damage string desired by the attacker and an observable sequence feasible in the supervisor such that the latter induces a sequence of control patterns, which allows the damage string to happen. It turns out that each risky pair can induce a smart weak sensor attack. Next, we show that, when the plant, supervisor and damage language are regular, it is computationally feasible to remove all such risky pairs from the plant behaviour, via a genuine encoding scheme, upon which we are able to establish our key result that the existence of a nonblocking supervisor resilient to smart sensor attacks is decidable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind in the DES literature on cyber attacks. The proposed decision process renders a specific synthesis procedure that guarantees to compute a resilient supervisor whenever it exists, which so far has not been achieved in the literature.",

Developing high-quality Yara rules to detect a malware family of interest can be labor- and time-intensive, even for expert users. Few tools exist and relatively little work has been done on how to automate the generation of Yara rules for specific families. In this paper, we leverage large n-grams ($n \\geq 8$) combined with a new biclustering algorithm to construct simple Yara rules more effectively than currently available software. Our method, AutoYara, is fast, allowing for deployment on low-resource equipment for teams that deploy to remote networks. Our results demonstrate that AutoYara can help reduce analyst workload by producing rules with useful true-positive rates while maintaining low false-positive rates, sometimes matching or even outperforming human analysts. In addition, real-world testing by malware analysts indicates AutoYara could reduce analyst time spent constructing Yara rules by 44-86%, allowing them to spend their time on the more advanced malware that current tools can't handle.

    "abstract": "From an operational and planning perspective, it is important to quantify the impact of increasing penetration of photovoltaics on the distribution system. Most existing impact assessment studies are scenario-based where derived results are scenario specific and not generalizable. Moreover, stochasticity in the temporal behavior of spatially distributed PVs requires a large number of scenarios that increase with the size of the network and the level of penetration. Therefore, we propose a new computationally efficient analytical framework of voltage sensitivity analysis that allows for stochastic analysis of voltage change due to random changes in PV generation. We first derive an analytical approximation for voltage change at any node of the network due to change in power at other nodes in an unbalanced distribution network. The quality of this approximation is reinforced via bounds on the approximation error. Then, we derive the probability distribution of voltage change at a certain node due to random changes in power injections/consumptions at multiple locations of the network. The accuracy of the proposed PVSA is illustrated using a modified version of the IEEE 37 bus test system. The proposed PVSA can serve as a powerful tool for proactive monitoring/control and ease the computational burden associated with perturbation based cybersecurity mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) regression tasks are common in many real-world data mining applications including finance, cybersecurity, energy, healthcare, prognostics, and many others. Due to the tremendous success of deep learning (DL) algorithms in various domains including image recognition and computer vision, researchers started adopting these techniques for solving MTS data mining problems, many of which are targeted for safety-critical and cost-critical applications. Unfortunately, DL algorithms are known for their susceptibility to adversarial examples which also makes the DL regression models for MTS forecasting also vulnerable to those attacks. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has explored the vulnerability of DL MTS regression models to adversarial time series examples, which is an important step, specifically when the forecasting from such models is used in safety-critical and cost-critical applications. In this work, we leverage existing adversarial attack generation techniques from the image classification domain and craft adversarial multivariate time series examples for three state-of-the-art deep learning regression models, specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We evaluate our study using Google stock and household power consumption dataset. The obtained results show that all the evaluated DL regression models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, transferable, and thus can lead to catastrophic consequences in safety-critical and cost-critical domains, such as energy and finance.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have achieved great success in recent years. However, large amounts of data are typically required to train such models. While some types of data, such as images, videos, and text, are easier to find, data in certain domains is difficult to obtain. For instance, cybersecurity applications routinely use network traffic data which organizations are reluctant to share, even internally, due to privacy reasons. An alternative is to use synthetically generated data; however, most existing data generating methods lack the ability to capture complex dependency structures that are usually prevalent in real data by assuming independence either temporally or between attributes. This paper presents our approach called STAN, Synthetic Network Traffic Generation using Autoregressive Neural models, to generate realistic synthetic network traffic data. Our novel autoregressive neural architecture captures both temporal dependence and dependence between attributes at any given time. It integrates convolutional neural layers (CNN) with mixture density layers (MDN) and softmax layers to model both continuous and discrete variables. We evaluate performance of STAN by training it on both a simulated dataset and a real network traffic data set. Multiple metrics are used to compare the generated data with real data and with data generated via several baseline methods. Finally, to answer the question -- can real network traffic data be substituted with synthetic data to train models of comparable accuracy -- we consider two commonly used models for anomaly detection in such data, and compare F1/MSE measures of models trained on real data and those on increasing proportions of generated data. The results show only a small decline in accuracy of models trained solely on synthetic data.",

    "abstract": "The growing demand for computer security and the cyberization trend are hallmarks of the 21st century. The rise in cyber-crime, digital currency, e-governance, and more, is well met by a corresponding recent jump in investment in new technology for securing computers around the globe. Recently, business and government sectors have begun to focus efforts on comprehensive cyber security solutions. With this growth has emerged the need for greater methods of collabo-ration and measurement of security. Despite all these efforts, this need has not been met, and there is still too little cross-disciplinary collaboration in the realm of computer security. This paper reviews the new trends in cyber security research, their contributions, and some identifiable limitations. We argue that these limitations are due largely to the absence of co-operation required to address a problem that is clearly multifaceted. We then identify a need for further standardization of terminology in computer security and propose guidelines for the global Internet multistakeholder community to consider when crafting such standards. We also assess the viability of some specific terms, including whether cyber should be used as a separate word when it is a descriptor (e.g. cyber security or cybersecurity), and conclude with recommendations for writing future papers on cyber security or the broader new field of all things relating to cyberspace, which has recently been dubbed Cybermatics, a term we also examine and propose alternatives to, like Cyber or Cybernomics. By furthering the effort of standardizing cyber security terminology, this paper lays groundwork for cross-disciplinary collaboration, agreement between technical and nontechnical stakeholders, and the drafting of universal Internet governance laws.",

    "abstract": "The work reported here addresses the capacity of psychophysiological sensors and measures using Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) to detect levels of trust for humans using AI-supported Human-Machine Interaction (HMI). Improvements to the analysis of EEG and GSR data may create models that perform as well, or better than, traditional tools. A challenge to analyzing the EEG and GSR data is the large amount of training data required due to a large number of variables in the measurements. Researchers have routinely used standard machine-learning classifiers like artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). Traditionally, these have provided few insights into which features of the EEG and GSR data facilitate the more and least accurate predictions - thus making it harder to improve the HMI and human-machine trust relationship. A key ingredient to applying trust-sensor research results to practical situations and monitoring trust in work environments is the understanding of which key features are contributing to trust and then reducing the amount of data needed for practical applications. We used the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) model as a process to reduce the volume of data required to monitor and enhance trust in HMI systems - a technology that could be valuable for governmental and public sector applications. Explainable AI can make HMI systems transparent and promote trust. From customer service in government agencies and community-level non-profit public service organizations to national military and cybersecurity institutions, many public sector organizations are increasingly concerned to have effective and ethical HMI with services that are trustworthy, unbiased, and free of unintended negative consequences.",

    "abstract": "Unit Commitment (UC) is a fundamental problem in power system operations. When coupled with generation maintenance, the joint optimization problem poses significant computational challenges due to coupling constraints linking maintenance and UC decisions. Obviously, these challenges grow with the size of the network. With the introduction of sensors for monitoring generator health and condition-based maintenance(CBM), these challenges have been magnified. ADMM-based decentralized methods have shown promise in solving large-scale UC problems, especially in vertically integrated power systems. However, in their current form, these methods fail to deliver similar computational performance and scalability when considering the joint UC and CBM problem. This paper provides a novel decentralized optimization framework for solving large-scale, joint UC and CBM problems. Our approach relies on the novel use of the subgradient method to temporally decouple various subproblems of the ADMM-based formulation of the joint problem along the maintenance horizon. By effectively utilizing multithreading along with the decentralized subgradient formulation, our approach delivers superior computational performance. Our approach does not require transfer of sensor data from its source thereby alleviating cybersecurity concerns. Using experiments on large scale test cases, we show that our framework delivers significantly faster solutions compared to centralized techniques without compromising solution quality.",

    "abstract": "Today arbitrary synthetic DNA can be ordered online and delivered within several days. In order to regulate both intentional and unintentional generation of dangerous substances, most synthetic gene providers screen DNA orders. A weakness in the Screening Framework Guidance for Providers of Synthetic Double-Stranded DNA allows screening protocols based on this guidance to be circumvented using a generic obfuscation procedure inspired by early malware obfuscation techniques. Furthermore, accessibility and automation of the synthetic gene engineering workflow, combined with insufficient cybersecurity controls, allow malware to interfere with biological processes within the victim's lab, closing the loop with the possibility of an exploit written into a DNA molecule presented by Ney et al. in USENIX Security'17. Here we present an end-to-end cyberbiological attack, in which unwitting biologists may be tricked into generating dangerous substances within their labs. Consequently, despite common biosecurity assumptions, the attacker does not need to have physical contact with the generated substance. The most challenging part of the attack, decoding of the obfuscated DNA, is executed within living cells while using primitive biological operations commonly employed by biologists during in-vivo gene editing. This attack scenario underlines the need to harden the synthetic DNA supply chain with protections against cyberbiological threats. To address these threats we propose an improved screening protocol that takes into account in-vivo gene editing.",

Cyber-security researchers are often overloaded with a variety of cyber-alerts on a daily basis many of which turn out to be false positives. In this paper, we use machine learning and natural language processing techniques to predict the consequences of cyberattacks. The idea is to enable security researchers to have tools at their disposal that makes it easier to communicate the attack consequences with various stakeholders who may have little to no cybersecurity expertise. Additionally, with the proposed approach researchers' cognitive load can be reduced by automatically predicting the consequences of attacks in case new attacks are discovered. We compare the performance through various machine learning models employing word vectors obtained using both tf-idf and Doc2Vec models. In our experiments, an accuracy of 60% was obtained using tf-idf features and 57% using Doc2Vec method for models based on LinearSVC model.",

    "abstract": "Intrusion detection into computer networks has become one of the most important issues in cybersecurity. Attackers keep on researching and coding to discover new vulnerabilities to penetrate information security system. In consequence computer systems must be daily upgraded using up-to-date techniques to keep hackers at bay. This paper focuses on the design and implementation of an intrusion detection system based on Deep Learning architectures. As a first step, a shallow network is trained with labelled log-in [into a computer network] data taken from the Dataset CICIDS2017. The internal behaviour of this network is carefully tracked and tuned by using plotting and exploring codes until it reaches a functional peak in intrusion prediction accuracy. As a second step, an autoencoder, trained with big unlabelled data, is used as a middle processor which feeds compressed information and abstract representation to the original shallow network. It is proven that the resultant deep architecture has a better performance than any version of the shallow network alone. The resultant functional code scripts, written in MATLAB, represent a re-trainable system which has been proved using real data, producing good precision and fast response.",

It is important to systematically review and synthesize the ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures for building a body of knowledge on this important topic. Objective: This paper aims at systematically reviewing ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures to identify and classify ML approaches, feature engineering techniques, evaluation datasets, and performance metrics used for these countermeasures. This review also aims at identifying gaps in research on ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures. Method: We used a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to select and review {92} papers. Results: The review has enabled us to (a) classify the ML approaches used in the countermeasures into data-driven, and behaviour-driven approaches, (b) categorize features into six types: behavioural, content-based, statistical, syntactical, spatial and temporal, (c) classify the evaluation datasets into simulated, synthesized, and real datasets and (d) identify 11 performance measures used by these studies. Conclusion: We conclude that: (i) the integration of data-driven and behaviour-driven approaches should be explored; (ii) There is a need of developing high quality and large size evaluation datasets; (iii) Incremental ML model training should be incorporated in countermeasures; (iv) resilience to adversarial learning should be considered and explored during the development of countermeasures to avoid poisoning attacks; and (v) the use of automated feature engineering should be encouraged for efficiently detecting data exfiltration attacks.",

    "abstract": "Recent works within machine learning have been tackling inputs of ever-increasing size, with cybersecurity presenting sequence classification problems of particularly extreme lengths. In the case of Windows executable malware detection, inputs may exceed $100$ MB, which corresponds to a time series with $T=100,000,000$ steps. To date, the closest approach to handling such a task is MalConv, a convolutional neural network capable of processing up to $T=2,000,000$ steps. The $\\mathcal{O}(T)$ memory of CNNs has prevented further application of CNNs to malware. In this work, we develop a new approach to temporal max pooling that makes the required memory invariant to the sequence length $T$. This makes MalConv $116\\times$ more memory efficient, and up to $25.8\\times$ faster to train on its original dataset, while removing the input length restrictions to MalConv. We re-invest these gains into improving the MalConv architecture by developing a new Global Channel Gating design, giving us an attention mechanism capable of learning feature interactions across 100 million time steps in an efficient manner, a capability lacked by the original MalConv CNN. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/NeuromorphicComputationResearchProgram/MalConv2",

    "abstract": "The cybersecurity breaches render surveillance systems vulnerable to video forgery attacks, under which authentic live video streams are tampered to conceal illegal human activities under surveillance cameras. Traditional video forensics approaches can detect and localize forgery traces in each video frame using computationally-expensive spatial-temporal analysis, while falling short in real-time verification of live video feeds. The recent work correlates time-series camera and wireless signals to recognize replayed surveillance videos using event-level timing information but it cannot realize fine-grained forgery detection and localization on each frame. To fill this gap, this paper proposes Secure-Pose, a novel cross-modal forgery detection and localization system for live surveillance videos using WiFi signals near the camera spot. We observe that coexisting camera and WiFi signals convey common human semantic information and the presence of forgery attacks on video frames will decouple such information correspondence. Secure-Pose extracts effective human pose features from synchronized multi-modal signals and detects and localizes forgery traces under both inter-frame and intra-frame attacks in each frame. We implement Secure-Pose using a commercial camera and two Intel 5300 NICs and evaluate it in real-world environments. Secure-Pose achieves a high detection accuracy of 95.1% and can effectively localize tampered objects under different forgery attacks.",

    "abstract": "According to a recent survey with more than 4000 software developers, less than half of developers can spot security holes. As a result, software products present a low-security quality expressed by vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber-criminals. This lack of quality and security is particularly dangerous if the software which contains the vulnerabilities is deployed in critical infrastructures. Serious games, and in particular, Capture-the-Flag(CTF) events, have shown promising results in improving secure coding awareness of software developers in the industry. The challenges in the CTF event, to be useful, must be adequately designed to address the target group. This paper presents novel contributions by investigating which challenge types are adequate to improve software developers' ability to write secure code in an industrial context. We propose 1) six challenge types usable in the industry context, and 2) a structure for the CTF challenges. Our investigation also presents results on 3) how to include hints and penalties into the cyber-security challenges. We evaluated our work through a survey with security experts.

Anadroid exploits two techniques to soundly raise precision: (1) it uses a pushdown system to precisely model dynamically dispatched interprocedural and exception-driven control-flow; (2) it uses Entry-Point Saturation (EPS) to soundly approximate all possible interleavings of asynchronous entry points in Android applications. (It also integrates static taint-flow analysis and least permissions analysis to expand the class of malicious behaviors which it can catch.) Anadroid provides rich user interface support for human analysts which must ultimately rule on the \"maliciousness\" of a behavior. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Anadroid's malware analysis, we had teams of analysts analyze a challenge suite of 52 Android applications released as part of the Auto- mated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) DARPA program. The first team analyzed the apps using a ver- sion of Anadroid that uses traditional (finite-state-machine-based) control-flow-analysis found in existing malware analysis tools; the second team analyzed the apps using a version of Anadroid that uses our enhanced pushdown-based control-flow-analysis. We measured machine analysis time, human analyst time, and their accuracy in flagging malicious applications. With pushdown analysis, we found statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreases in time: from 85 minutes per app to 35 minutes per app in human plus machine analysis time; and statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in accuracy with the pushdown-driven analyzer: from 71% correct identification to 95% correct identification.",

    "abstract": "Beyond its highly publicized victories in Go, there have been numerous successful applications of deep learning in information retrieval, computer vision and speech recognition. In cybersecurity, an increasing number of companies have become excited about the potential of deep learning, and have started to use it for various security incidents, the most popular being malware detection. These companies assert that deep learning (DL) could help turn the tide in the battle against malware infections. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial samples, a flaw that plagues most if not all statistical learning models. Recent research has demonstrated that those with malicious intent can easily circumvent deep learning-powered malware detection by exploiting this flaw. In order to address this problem, previous work has developed various defense mechanisms that either augmenting training data or enhance model's complexity. However, after a thorough analysis of the fundamental flaw in DNNs, we discover that the effectiveness of current defenses is limited and, more importantly, cannot provide theoretical guarantees as to their robustness against adversarial sampled-based attacks. As such, we propose a new adversary resistant technique that obstructs attackers from constructing impactful adversarial samples by randomly nullifying features within samples. In this work, we evaluate our proposed technique against a real world dataset with 14,679 malware variants and 17,399 benign programs. We theoretically validate the robustness of our technique, and empirically show that our technique significantly boosts DNN robustness to adversarial samples while maintaining high accuracy in classification. To demonstrate the general applicability of our proposed method, we also conduct experiments using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, generally used in image recognition research.",

    "abstract": "There have been extensive efforts in government, academia, and industry to anticipate, forecast, and mitigate cyber attacks. A common approach is time-series forecasting of cyber attacks based on data from network telescopes, honeypots, and automated intrusion detection/prevention systems. This research has uncovered key insights such as systematicity in cyber attacks. Here, we propose an alternate perspective of this problem by performing forecasting of attacks that are analyst-detected and -verified occurrences of malware. We call these instances of malware cyber event data. Specifically, our dataset was analyst-detected incidents from a large operational Computer Security Service Provider (CSSP) for the U.S. Department of Defense, which rarely relies only on automated systems. Our data set consists of weekly counts of cyber events over approximately seven years. Since all cyber events were validated by analysts, our dataset is unlikely to have false positives which are often endemic in other sources of data. Further, the higher-quality data could be used for a number for resource allocation, estimation of security resources, and the development of effective risk-management strategies. We used a Bayesian State Space Model for forecasting and found that events one week ahead could be predicted. To quantify bursts, we used a Markov model. Our findings of systematicity in analyst-detected cyber attacks are consistent with previous work using other sources. The advanced information provided by a forecast may help with threat awareness by providing a probable value and range for future cyber events one week ahead. Other potential applications for cyber event forecasting include proactive allocation of resources and capabilities for cyber defense (e.g., analyst staffing and sensor configuration) in CSSPs. Enhanced threat awareness may improve cybersecurity.",

    "abstract": "Massive power-law graphs drive many fields: metagenomics, brain mapping, Internet-of-things, cybersecurity, and sparse machine learning. The development of novel algorithms and systems to process these data requires the design, generation, and validation of enormous graphs with exactly known properties. Such graphs accelerate the proper testing of new algorithms and systems and are a prerequisite for success on real applications. Many random graph generators currently exist that require realizing a graph in order to know its exact properties: number of vertices, number of edges, degree distribution, and number of triangles. Designing graphs using these random graph generators is a time-consuming trial-and-error process. This paper presents a novel approach that uses Kronecker products to allow the exact computation of graph properties prior to graph generation. In addition, when a real graph is desired, it can be generated quickly in memory on a parallel computer with no-interprocessor communication. To test this approach, graphs with $10^{12}$ edges are generated on a 40,000+ core supercomputer in 1 second and exactly agree with those predicted by the theory. In addition, to demonstrate the extensibility of this approach, decetta-scale graphs with up to $10^{30}$ edges are simulated in a few minutes on a laptop.",

    "abstract": "Operating in a dynamic real world environment requires a forward thinking and adversarial aware design for classifiers, beyond fitting the model to the training data. In such scenarios, it is necessary to make classifiers - a) harder to evade, b) easier to detect changes in the data distribution over time, and c) be able to retrain and recover from model degradation. While most works in the security of machine learning has concentrated on the evasion resistance (a) problem, there is little work in the areas of reacting to attacks (b and c). Additionally, while streaming data research concentrates on the ability to react to changes to the data distribution, they often take an adversarial agnostic view of the security problem. This makes them vulnerable to adversarial activity, which is aimed towards evading the concept drift detection mechanism itself. In this paper, we analyze the security of machine learning, from a dynamic and adversarial aware perspective. The existing techniques of Restrictive one class classifier models, Complex learning models and Randomization based ensembles, are shown to be myopic as they approach security as a static task. These methodologies are ill suited for a dynamic environment, as they leak excessive information to an adversary, who can subsequently launch attacks which are indistinguishable from the benign data. Based on empirical vulnerability analysis against a sophisticated adversary, a novel feature importance hiding approach for classifier design, is proposed. The proposed design ensures that future attacks on classifiers can be detected and recovered from. The proposed work presents motivation, by serving as a blueprint, for future work in the area of Dynamic-Adversarial mining, which combines lessons learned from Streaming data mining, Adversarial learning and Cybersecurity.",

    "abstract": "Active Traffic Management (ATM) systems have been introduced by transportation agencies to manage recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. ATM systems rely on the interconnectivity of components made possible by wired and/or wireless networks. Unfortunately, this connectivity that supports ATM systems also provides potential system access points that results in vulnerability to cyberattacks. This is becoming more pronounced as ATM systems begin to integrate internet of things (IoT) devices. Hence, there is a need to rigorously evaluate ATM systems for cyberattack vulnerabilities, and explore design concepts that provide stability and graceful degradation in the face of cyberattacks. In this research, a prototype ATM system along with a real-time cyberattack monitoring system were developed for a 1.5-mile section of I-66 in Northern Virginia. The monitoring system detects deviation from expected operation of an ATM system by comparing lane control states generated by the ATM system with lane control states deemed most likely by the monitoring system. In case of any deviation between two sets of states, the monitoring system displays the lane control states generated by the back-up data source. In a simulation experiment, the prototype ATM system and cyberattack monitoring system were subject to emulated cyberattacks. The evaluation results showed that when subject to cyberattack, the mean speed reduced by 15% compared to the case with the ATM system and was similar to the baseline case. This illustrates that the effectiveness of the ATM system was negated by cyberattacks. The monitoring system however, allowed the ATM system to revert to an expected safe state and reduced the negative impact of cyberattacks. These results illustrate the need to revisit ATM system design concepts as a means to protect against cyberattacks in addition to traditional system intrusion prevention approaches.",

    "abstract": "We present a practical methodology for securing the password-based authentication scheme. We propose a solution based on the well-known (k,n) threshold scheme of Shamir for sharing a secret, where in our case the secret is the password itself and (k,n) threshold scheme means that n password-derived secrets (shares) are created and k less than n shares are necessary and sufficient for reconstructing the password, while k-1 are not sufficient. The scheme is information-theoretic secure. Since each of the n shares is stored on a different host (shareholder), an attacker will need to compromise k different shareholders for obtaining an amount of data sufficient for reconstructing the secret. Furthermore, in order to be resistant to the compromising of the server (dealer) coordinating the shareholders we define a variant of the classic Shamir, where the Shamir's abscissae are unknown to dealer and shareholders, making the reconstruction impossible even in the case of dealer and shareholders compromised. In addition we use the Pedersen technique for allowing the verification of shares. For the described scenario we have designed two protocols: the registration (user's sign-up, to be carried out once), and authentication (user's login). We analyse several scenarios where dealer and/or shareholders are partially/totally compromised and confirm that none of them is enabling the attacker to break the authentication. Furthermore we focus on cases where one or more byzantine servers are presented, analysing the impact on the framework and show the adopted mechanisms to be safe against these kinds of attacks. We have developed a prototype demonstrating that our framework works correctly, effectively and efficiently. It provides a first feasibility study that will provide a base for structured and engineered cloud-based implementations aiming at providing an authentication-as-a-service.",

Next-generation audio-visual (lip-reading driven) hearing-aids stand as a major enabler to realise more intelligible audio. However, high data rate, low latency, low computational complexity, and privacy are some of the major bottlenecks to the successful deployment of such advanced hearing aids. To address these challenges, we envision an integration of 5G Cloud-Radio Access Network, Internet of Things (IoT), and strong privacy algorithms to fully benefit from the possibilities these technologies have to offer. The envisioned 5G IoT enabled secure audio-visual (AV) hearing-aid transmits the encrypted compressed AV information and receives encrypted enhanced reconstructed speech in real-time which fully addresses cybersecurity attacks such as location privacy and eavesdropping. For security implementation, a real-time lightweight AV encryption is utilized. For speech enhancement, the received AV information in the cloud is used to filter noisy audio using both deep learning and analytical acoustic modelling (filtering based approach). To offload the computational complexity and real-time optimization issues, the framework runs deep learning and big data optimization processes in the background on the cloud. Specifically, in this work, three key contributions are reported: (1) 5G IoT enabled secure audio-visual hearing-aid framework that aims to achieve a round-trip latency up to 5ms with 100 Mbps datarate (2) Real-time lightweight audio-visual encryption (3) Lip-reading driven deep learning approach for speech enhancement in the cloud. The critical analysis in terms of both speech enhancement and AV encryption demonstrate the potential of the envisioned technology in acquiring high-quality speech reconstruction and secure mobile AV hearing aid communication.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, machine learning techniques have revolutionized how research is done, from designing new materials and predicting their properties to assisting drug discovery to advancing cybersecurity. Recently, we added to this list by showing how a machine learning algorithm (a so-called learner) combined with an optimization routine can assist experimental efforts in the realm of tuning semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices. Among other applications, semiconductor QDs are a candidate system for building quantum computers. The present-day tuning techniques for bringing the QD devices into a desirable configuration suitable for quantum computing that rely on heuristics do not scale with the increasing size of the quantum dot arrays required for even near-term quantum computing demonstrations. Establishing a reliable protocol for tuning that does not rely on the gross-scale heuristics developed by experimentalists is thus of great importance. To implement the machine learning-based approach, we constructed a dataset of simulated QD device characteristics, such as the conductance and the charge sensor response versus the applied electrostatic gate voltages. Here, we describe the methodology for generating the dataset, as well as its validation in training convolutional neural networks. We show that the learner's accuracy in recognizing the state of a device is ~96.5 % in both current- and charge-sensor-based training. We also introduce a tool that enables other researchers to use this approach for further research: QFlow lite - a Python-based mini-software suite that uses the dataset to train neural networks to recognize the state of a device and differentiate between states in experimental data. This work gives the definitive reference for the new dataset that will help enable researchers to use it in their experiments or to develop new machine learning approaches and concepts.",

    "abstract": "May 30-June 2, 2017, Scholarship for Service (SFS) scholars at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) analyzed the security of a targeted aspect of the UMBC computer systems. During this hands-on study, with complete access to source code, students identified vulnerabilities, devised and implemented exploits, and suggested mitigations. As part of a pioneering program at UMBC to extend SFS scholarships to community colleges, the study helped initiate six students from two nearby community colleges, who transferred to UMBC in fall 2017 to complete their four-year degrees in computer science and information systems. The study examined the security of a set of \"NetAdmin\" custom scripts that enable UMBC faculty and staff to open the UMBC firewall to allow external access to machines they control for research purposes. Students discovered vulnerabilities stemming from weak architectural design, record overflow, and failure to sanitize inputs properly. For example, they implemented a record-overflow and code-injection exploit that exfiltrated the vital API key of the UMBC firewall. This report summarizes student activities and findings, and reflects on lessons learned for students, educators, and system administrators. Our students found the collaborative experience inspirational, students and educators appreciated the authentic case study, and IT administrators gained access to future employees and received free recommendations for improving the security of their systems. We hope that other universities can benefit from our motivational and educational strategy of teaming educators and system administrators to engage students in active project-based learning centering on focused questions about their university computer systems.",

    "abstract": "The article presents a study using attacks such as a fake access point and a phishing page. The previous publications on social engineering have been reviewed, statistics of break-ups are analyzed and directions and mechanism of realization of attacks having elements of social engineering are analyzed. The data from the research in three different places were collected and analyzed and the content statistics were provided. For comparison, three categories of higher education institutions were chosen: technical, humanitarian and mixed profiles. Since the research was conducted in educational institutions during the week, most students in the experiment and graduate students took part in the experiment. For each educational institution, a registration form template was created that mimicked the design of the main pages. Examples of hardware and software implementation of a typical stand for attack, data collection and analysis are given. In order to construct a test stand, widely available components were chosen to show how easy it is to carry out attacks of this kind without significant initial costs and special skills. The article provides statistics on the number of connections, permission to use the address of the e-mail and password, as well as permission to automatically transfer service data to the browser (cookies). The statistics are processed using specially written algorithms. The proposed approaches to solving the problem of socio-technical attacks can be used and implemented for operation on any objects of information activity. As a result of the experiments, it is clear that the awareness of users of even technical specialties is not enough, so one needs to pay particular attention to the development of methods for raising awareness of users and reducing the number of potential attacks on objects of information activity.",

    "abstract": "To date, there is a need for the development of efficient data and device exchange protocols that this exchange will provide, since standard protocols used in traditional networks can not fully meet the needs of a new type of network. The article describes the process of development and implementation of a full-scale model of noise-resistant and sensor network breaks. The stability of this network is achieved by building a distributed network, in which all nodes send messages to all available nodes. Wireless mobile peer-to-peer network (MANET) can be configured automatically, so the nodes in it can move freely. Wireless networks do not have the complexity of infrastructure and management, which allows devices to create and join on-the-go networks - anywhere, anytime. In this paper, the theoretical part of the functioning of such networks and the field of their use is considered. After that, an initial analysis of the available equipment used for constructing such hardware solutions was conducted. The software for developing such solutions is considered in detail, as well as examples of finished models that implement the investigated functional. After that, several variants of the model of network nodes, as well as the test device for creating a payload on the network, are collected. For this purpose, third-party open solutions were used in conjunction with their own developments. The system received a series of tests that made it possible to understand the weak and strong points of such a network and draw conclusions for the further development of the project and the creation of an improved working prototype. The article presents the basic electrical circuits of devices, the list of used equipment and software used and the photographic material of prototypes of the created system.",

    "abstract": "The research literature on cybersecurity incident detection & response is very rich in automatic detection methodologies, in particular those based on the anomaly detection paradigm. However, very little attention has been devoted to the diagnosis ability of the methods, aimed to provide useful information on the causes of a given detected anomaly. This information is of utmost importance for the security team to reduce the time from detection to response. In this paper, we present Multivariate Big Data Analysis (MBDA), a complete intrusion detection approach based on 5 steps to effectively handle massive amounts of disparate data sources. The approach has been designed to deal with the main characteristics of Big Data, that is, the high volume, velocity and variety. The core of the approach is the Multivariate Statistical Network Monitoring (MSNM) technique proposed in a recent paper. Unlike in state of the art machine learning methodologies applied to the intrusion detection problem, when an anomaly is identified in MBDA the output of the system includes the detail of the logs of raw information associated to this anomaly, so that the security team can use this information to elucidate its root causes. MBDA is based in two open software packages available in Github: the MEDA Toolbox and the FCParser. We illustrate our approach with two case studies. The first one demonstrates the application of MBDA to semistructured sources of information, using the data from the VAST 2012 mini challenge 2. This complete case study is supplied in a virtual machine available for download. In the second case study we show the Big Data capabilities of the approach in data collected from a real network with labeled attacks.",

    "abstract": "The widespread use of wireless technologies leads to an ever-increasing number of users and permanently functioning devices. However, the growth of the number of wireless users in a limited space and a limited frequency range leads to an increase in their mutual influence, which ultimately affects the throughput of wireless channels and even the performance of the system as a whole. The article presents the statistics and tendencies of the distribution of wireless networks of the IEEE 802.11 standard systems, as well as analyzes the main problems that arise during the expansion of their use. Substantiation and choice of ways to overcome these difficulties largely depends on the objective control of radiation parameters of access points and subscriber funds in a particular environment. The review of the state control facilities provided by the developers of the equipment is presented, and author's variants of experimental measuring complexes are offered, allowing to control signal and information parameters of Wi-Fi systems. The experimental results obtained with the use of the indicated means, obtained using the accelerating metal-plate lens as an additional autonomous element for focusing the field, including for MIMO systems, the effect of the accelerating metal-plate lens on the spatial distribution of the field, on the spectral structure of the signal are presented. In addition, polarization effects were investigated. Possible ways to further increase the availability, integrity of information and energy efficiency of wireless access systems are discussed. The authors propose simpler and less costly options for increasing the direction of radiation on the basis of an accelerating metal-plate lens, experimentally tested, as well as the use of zone zoning on the path of the computer.",

    "abstract": "Subjective Logic (SL) is one of well-known belief models that can explicitly deal with uncertain opinions and infer unknown opinions based on a rich set of operators of fusing multiple opinions. Due to high simplicity and applicability, SL has been substantially applied in a variety of decision making in the area of cybersecurity, opinion models, trust models, and/or social network analysis. However, SL and its variants have exposed limitations in predicting uncertain opinions in real-world dynamic network data mainly in three-fold: (1) a lack of scalability to deal with a large-scale network; (2) limited capability to handle heterogeneous topological and temporal dependencies among node-level opinions; and (3) a high sensitivity with conflicting evidence that may generate counterintuitive opinions derived from the evidence. In this work, we proposed a novel deep learning (DL)-based dynamic opinion inference model while node-level opinions are still formalized based on SL meaning that an opinion has a dimension of uncertainty in addition to belief and disbelief in a binomial opinion (i.e., agree or disagree). The proposed DL-based dynamic opinion inference model overcomes the above three limitations by integrating the following techniques: (1) state-of-the-art DL techniques, such as the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and the Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for modeling the topological and temporal heterogeneous dependency information of a given dynamic network; (2) modeling conflicting opinions based on robust statistics; and (3) a highly scalable inference algorithm to predict dynamic, uncertain opinions in a linear computation time. We validated the outperformance of our proposed DL-based algorithm (i.e., GCN-GRU-opinion model) via extensive comparative performance analysis based on four real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a key cybersecurity tool for network administrators as it identifies malicious traffic and cyberattacks. With the recent successes of machine learning techniques such as deep learning, more and more IDS are now using machine learning algorithms to detect attacks faster. However, these systems lack robustness when facing previously unseen types of attacks. With the increasing number of new attacks, especially against Internet of Things devices, having a robust IDS able to spot unusual and new attacks becomes necessary. This work explores the possibility of leveraging generative adversarial models to improve the robustness of machine learning based IDS. More specifically, we propose a new method named SIGMA, that leverages adversarial examples to strengthen IDS against new types of attacks. Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and metaheuristics, SIGMA %Our method consists in generates adversarial examples, iteratively, and uses it to retrain a machine learning-based IDS, until a convergence of the detection rate (i.e. until the detection system is not improving anymore). A round of improvement consists of a generative phase, in which we use GANs and metaheuristics to generate instances ; an evaluation phase in which we calculate the detection rate of those newly generated attacks ; and a training phase, in which we train the IDS with those attacks. We have evaluated the SIGMA method for four standard machine learning classification algorithms acting as IDS, with a combination of GAN and a hybrid local-search and genetic algorithm, to generate new datasets of attacks. Our results show that SIGMA can successfully generate adversarial attacks against different machine learning based IDS. Also, using SIGMA, we can improve the performance of an IDS to up to 100\\% after as little as two rounds of improvement.",

The proposed approaches can be used in the development, implementation and operation of wireless enterprise, industrial, and personal systems. Possible areas of development for this work are related to research on improving encryption algorithms (increasing key length, using asymmetric ciphers, etc.), comparing their performance, and implementing a complete data exchange protocol. During the work there were problems in the implementation of encryption algorithms on low-power processors. During the work, a number of issues were resolved regarding type reduction, addressing, memory space, buffer overflow, and more. Issues resolved with reconciliation of receiver and transmitter operation. Examples of hardware and software implementation of encryption and decryption of different devices based on Pololu Wixel are given in the paper. The basic task of building a secure communication channel by encrypting data in the channel was solved and firmware and application software were obtained to fully validate the devices. In addition, this work has great application potential, since the implementation of encryption in existing systems will have a small impact on implementation and will not affect the project budget, but will dramatically improve the security of data transmission in these networks. The proposed approaches can be used in the development, implementation and operation of wireless enterprise, industrial, and personal systems. Continuing this work may be to test the performance of other protocols on this and similar hardware for systems that may be embedded in short-range wireless communication projects of short-range standards.",

The question that we address in this article pertains to designing these CPS systems to be resilient-from-the-ground-up, and through progressive learning, resilient-by-reaction. An optimally designed system is resilient to both unique attacks and recurrent attacks, the latter with a lower overhead. Overall, the notion of resilience can be thought of in the light of three main sources of lack of resilience, as follows: exogenous factors, such as natural variations and attack scenarios; mismatch between engineered designs and exogenous factors ranging from DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks or other cybersecurity nightmares, so called \"black swan\" events, disabling critical services of the municipal electrical grids and other connected infrastructures, data breaches, and network failures; and the fragility of engineered designs themselves encompassing bugs, human-computer interactions (HCI), and the overall complexity of real-world systems.

    "abstract": "Contemporary fuzz testing techniques focus on identifying memory corruption vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to achieve either remote code execution or information disclosure. Meanwhile, Algorithmic Complexity (AC)vulnerabilities, which are a common attack vector for denial-of-service attacks, remain an understudied threat. In this paper, we present HotFuzz, a framework for automatically discovering AC vulnerabilities in Java libraries. HotFuzz uses micro-fuzzing, a genetic algorithm that evolves arbitrary Java objects in order to trigger the worst-case performance for a method under test. We define Small Recursive Instantiation (SRI) as a technique to derive seed inputs represented as Java objects to micro-fuzzing. After micro-fuzzing, HotFuzz synthesizes test cases that triggered AC vulnerabilities into Java programs and monitors their execution in order to reproduce vulnerabilities outside the fuzzing framework. HotFuzz outputs those programs that exhibit high CPU utilization as witnesses for AC vulnerabilities in a Java library. We evaluate HotFuzz over the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the 100 most popular Java libraries on Maven, and challenges contained in the DARPA Space and Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program. We evaluate SRI's effectiveness by comparing the performance of micro-fuzzing with SRI, measured by the number of AC vulnerabilities detected, to simply using empty values as seed inputs. In this evaluation, we verified known AC vulnerabilities, discovered previously unknown AC vulnerabilities that we responsibly reported to vendors, and received confirmation from both IBM and Oracle. Our results demonstrate that micro-fuzzing finds AC vulnerabilities in real-world software, and that micro-fuzzing with SRI-derived seed inputs outperforms using empty values.",

Manufacturers of passenger vehicles hold secret their mappings of CAN data to vehicle signals, and these definitions vary per make, model, and year. Without these mappings, the wealth of real-time vehicle information hidden in CAN packets is uninterpretable-- severely impeding vehicle-related research including CAN cybersecurity, after-market tuning, efficiency and performance monitoring, and fault diagnosis. Guided by the four-part CAN signal definition, we present CAN-D (CAN Decoder), a modular, four-step pipeline for identifying each signal's boundaries (start bit and length), endianness (byte ordering), signedness (bit-to-integer encoding), and meaningful, physical interpretation (label, unit, scaling factors). En route to CAN-D, we provide a comprehensive review of the CAN signal reverse engineering research. All previous methods ignore endianness and signedness, rendering them simply incapable of decoding many standard CAN signal definitions. We formulate and provide an efficient solution to an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of signal boundaries and byte orderings. In addition, we provide two novel, state-of-the-art signal boundary classifiers (both superior to previous approaches in precision and recall) and the first signedness classification algorithm, which exhibits > 97% F-score. Overall, CAN-D is the only solution with the potential to extract any CAN signal and is the state of the art. In evaluation on ten vehicles of different makes, CAN-D's average $\\ell^1$ error is 5 times better than all preceding methods and exhibits lower average error even when considering only signals that meet prior methods' assumptions. Finally, CAN-D is implemented in lightweight hardware allowing OBD-II plugin for real-time in-vehicle CAN decoding.",

    "abstract": "Homoglyph attacks are a common technique used by hackers to conduct phishing. Domain names or links that are visually similar to actual ones are created via punycode to obfuscate the attack, making the victim more susceptible to phishing. For example, victims may mistake \"|inkedin.com\" for \"linkedin.com\" and in the process, divulge personal details to the fake website. Current State of The Art (SOTA) typically make use of string comparison algorithms (e.g. Levenshtein Distance), which are computationally heavy. One reason for this is the lack of publicly available datasets thus hindering the training of more advanced Machine Learning (ML) models. Furthermore, no one font is able to render all types of punycode correctly, posing a significant challenge to the creation of a dataset that is unbiased toward any particular font. This coupled with the vast number of internet domains pose a challenge in creating a dataset that can capture all possible variations. Here, we show how a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), PhishGAN, can be used to generate images of hieroglyphs, conditioned on non-homoglpyh input text images. Practical changes to current SOTA were required to facilitate the generation of more varied homoglyph text-based images. We also demonstrate a workflow of how PhishGAN together with a Homoglyph Identifier (HI) model can be used to identify the domain the homoglyph was trying to imitate. Furthermore, we demonstrate how PhishGAN's ability to generate datasets on the fly facilitate the quick adaptation of cybersecurity systems to detect new threats as they emerge.",

    "abstract": "The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global lockdown with severe health and economical consequences. As a result, authorities around the globe have expressed their needs for better tools to monitor the spread of the virus and to support human labor. Researchers and technology companies such as Google and Apple have offered to develop such tools in the form of contact tracing applications. The goal of these applications is to continuously track people's proximity and to make the smartphone users aware if they have ever been in contact with positively diagnosed people, so that they could self-quarantine and possibly have an infection test. A fundamental challenge with these smartphone-based contact tracing technologies is to ensure the security and privacy of their users. Moving from manual to smartphone-based contact tracing creates new cyber risks that could suddenly affect the entire population. Major risks include for example the abuse of the people's private data by companies and/or authorities, or the spreading of wrong alerts by malicious users in order to force individuals to go into quarantine. In April 2020, the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) was announced with the goal to develop and evaluate secure solutions for European countries. However, after a while, several team members left this consortium and created DP-3T which has led to an international debate among the experts. At this time, it is confusing for the non-expert to follow this debate; this report aims to shed light on the various proposed technologies by providing an objective assessment of the cybersecurity and privacy risks. We first review the state-of-the-art in digital contact tracing technologies and then explore the risk-utility trade-offs of the techniques proposed for COVID-19. We focus specifically on the technologies that are already adopted by certain countries.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are remote-controlled vehicles capable of flight and are present in a variety of environments from military operations to domestic enjoyment. These vehicles are great assets, but just as their pilot can control them remotely, cyberattacks can be executed in a similar manner. Cyber attacks on UAVs can bring a plethora of issues to physical and virtual systems. Such malfunctions are capable of giving an attacker the ability to steal data, incapacitate the UAV, or hijack the UAV. To mitigate such attacks, it is necessary to identify and patch vulnerabilities that may be maliciously exploited. In this paper, a new UAV vulnerability is explored with related UAV security practices identified for possible exploitation using large streams of data sent at specific ports. The more in-depth model involves strings of data involving FTP-specific keywords sent to the UAV's FTP port in the form of a fuzzing test and launching thousands of packets at other ports on the UAV as well. During these tests, virtual and physical systems are monitored extensively to identify specific patterns and vulnerabilities. This model is applied to a Parrot Bebop 2, which accurately portrays a UAV that had their network compromised by an attacker and portrays many lower-end UAV models for domestic use. During testings, the Parrot Bebop 2 is monitored for degradation in GPS performance, video speed, the UAV's reactivity to the pilot, motor function, and the accuracy of the UAV's sensor data. All these points of monitoring give a comprehensive view of the UAV's reaction to each individual test. In this paper, countermeasures to combat the exploitation of this vulnerability will be discussed as well as possible attacks that can branch from the fuzzing tests.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Being connected to a network exposes surgical robots to cyberattacks, which can damage the patient or the operator. These injuries are normally caused by safety failures, such as accidents with industrial robots, but cyberattacks are caused by security failures instead. Surgical robots are increasingly sold and used in the European Union, so we decide to uncover whether this change has been considered by EU law, and which legal remedies and actions a patient or manufacturer would have in a single national legal system in the union. We first conduct a case study, where we analyse which legal remedies a patient can make use of, if they are injured by a surgical robot caused by a cyberattack in the national legal system. We also explore whether cybersecurity and cyberattacks are considered by the upcoming Medical Device Regulation of the EU. We show that the selected national legal system is adequate. This is because of its flexibility and in a certain approach even to ignore the distinction between safety and security to the benefit of the patient, and in one situation to remove liability from the manufacturer by erasing its status as party. Otherwise, unless the operator or other parties have made the cyberattack more likely to occur, the manufacturer is liable. We find that the regulation does not directly consider security defects, requiring interpretation and use of guidance to show it. Due to the risk cyberattacks pose on medical equipment, we find this to not be adequate. We further find that the regulators of medical devices, including surgical robots, will not necessarily have adequate staff or rules of enforcement, as this has been left to the member states to solve. But, we also find, due to the comprehensive number of rules that can be applied cumulatively, together with the possibility for further rules and compliance later on, that these issues could be solved in the future.",

    "abstract": "The cloud model allows many enterprises able to outsource computing resources at an affordable price without having to commit the expense upfront. Although the cloud providers are responsible for the security of the cloud, there are still many security concerns due to inherently complex model the cloud providers operate on (e.g.,multi-tenancy). In addition, the enterprises whose services have migrated into the cloud have a preference for their own cybersecurity situation awareness capability on top of the security mechanisms provided by the cloud providers. In this way, the enterprises can monitor the performance of the security offerings of the cloud and have a choice to decide and select potential response strategies more appropriate to the enterprise in the presence of the attack where the defense provided by the cloud doesn't work for them. However, some response strategies, such as Moving Target Defense (MTD) techniques shown to be effective to secure cloud, cannot be deployed by the enterprise themselves. In this paper, we propose a framework that enables better collaboration between enterprises and cloud providers. Our proposed framework, which offers more in-depth security analysis based on the set of most advanced security metrics, allows the security experts of the enterprise to obtain better situational awareness in the cloud. With better and more effective situation awareness of cloud security, our framework can support better decision making and further allows to deploy more appropriate threat responses to protect the outsourced resources. We also propose a secure protocol which can facilitate more secure communication between the enterprises and cloud provider. Using our proposed secure protocol, which is based on authentication and key exchange mechanism, the enterprises can send a secure request to the cloud provider to perform a selected defensive strategy.",

    "abstract": "Electrical energy is a vital part of modern life, and expectations for grid resilience to allow a continuous and reliable energy supply has tremendously increased even during adverse events (e.g., Ukraine cyber-attack, Hurricane Maria). The global pandemic COVID-19 has raised the electric energy reliability risk due to potential workforce disruptions, supply chain interruptions, and increased possible cybersecurity threats. The pandemic introduces a significant degree of uncertainly to the grid operation in the presence of other extreme events like natural disasters, unprecedented outages, aging power grids, high proliferation of distributed generation, and cyber-attacks. This situation increases the need for measures for the resiliency of power grids to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic as well as simultaneous extreme events. Solutions to manage such an adverse scenario will be multi-fold: a) emergency planning and organizational support, b) following safety protocol, c) utilizing enhanced automation and sensing for situational awareness, and d) integration of advanced technologies and data points for ML-driven enhanced decision support. Enhanced digitalization and automation resulted in better network visibility at various levels, including generation, transmission, and distribution. These data or information can be utilized to take advantage of advanced machine learning techniques for automation and increased power grid resilience. In this paper, a) we review the impact of COVID-19 on power grid operations and actions taken by operators/organizations to minimize the impact of COVID-19, and b) we have presented the recently developed tool and concepts using natural language processing (NLP) in the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence that can be used for increasing resiliency of power systems in normal and in extreme scenarios such as COVID-19 pandemics.",

    "abstract": "In order to withstand the ever-increasing invasion of privacy by CCTV cameras and technologies, on par CCTV-aware solutions must exist that provide privacy, safety, and cybersecurity features. We argue that a first important step towards such CCTV-aware solutions must be a mapping system that provides both privacy and safety routing and navigation options. To the best of our knowledge, there are no mapping nor navigation systems that support privacy and safety routing options. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a CCTV-aware routing and navigation solution. The aim of this feasibility exploration is to understand what are the main impacts of CCTV on privacy, and what are the challenges and benefits to building such technology. We evaluate our approach on seven (7) pedestrian walking routes within the downtown area of the city of Jyvaskyla, Finland. We first map a total of 450 CCTV cameras, and then experiment with routing and navigation under several different configurations to coarsely model the possible cameras' parameters and coverage from the real-world. We report two main results. First, our preliminary findings support the overall feasibility of our approach. Second, the results also reveal a data-driven worrying reality for persons wishing to preserve their privacy/anonymity as their main living choice. When modelling cameras at their low performance end, a privacy-preserving route has on average a 1.5x distance increase when compared to generic routing. When modelling cameras at their medium-to-high performance end, a privacy-preserving route has on average a 5.0x distance increase, while in some cases there are no privacy-preserving routes possible at all. These results further support and encourage both global mapping of CCTV cameras and refinements to camera modelling and underlying technology.",

    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are increasingly being deployed across multiple functionalities, ranging from healthcare devices and wearables to critical infrastructures, e.g., nuclear power plants, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and smart homes. These devices are inherently not secure across their comprehensive software, hardware, and network stacks, thus presenting a large attack surface that can be exploited by hackers. In this article, we present an innovative technique for detecting unknown system vulnerabilities, managing these vulnerabilities, and improving incident response when such vulnerabilities are exploited. The novelty of this approach lies in extracting intelligence from known real-world CPS/IoT attacks, representing them in the form of regular expressions, and employing machine learning (ML) techniques on this ensemble of regular expressions to generate new attack vectors and security vulnerabilities. Our results show that 10 new attack vectors and 122 new vulnerability exploits can be successfully generated that have the potential to exploit a CPS or an IoT ecosystem. The ML methodology achieves an accuracy of 97.4% and enables us to predict these attacks efficiently with an 87.2% reduction in the search space. We demonstrate the application of our method to the hacking of the in-vehicle network of a connected car. To defend against the known attacks and possible novel exploits, we discuss a defense-in-depth mechanism for various classes of attacks and the classification of data targeted by such attacks. This defense mechanism optimizes the cost of security measures based on the sensitivity of the protected resource, thus incentivizing its adoption in real-world CPS/IoT by cybersecurity practitioners.",
