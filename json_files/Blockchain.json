    "abstract": "The suitability of a particular blockchain for a given use case depends mainly on the blockchain's functional and non-functional properties. Such properties may vary over time, and thus, a selected blockchain may become unsuitable for a given use case. This uncertainty may hinder the widespread adoption of blockchain technologies in general. To mitigate the impact of volatile blockchain properties, we propose a framework that monitors several blockchains, allows the user to define functional and non-functional requirements, determines the most appropriate blockchain, and enables the switchover to that chain at runtime. Our evaluation using a reference implementation shows that switching to another blockchain can save cost and enable users to benefit from better performance and a higher level of trust.",

In particular, solutions enabling blockchains to verify the existence of data on other blockchains are either very costly or are not fully decentralized. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Testimonium, a novel blockchain relay scheme that applies a validation-on-demand pattern and the on-chain execution of Simplified Payment Verifications to enable the verification of data across blockchains while remaining fully decentralized. Evaluating the scheme for Ethereum-based blockchains shows that Testimonium achieves a cost reduction of up to 92% over existing solutions. As such, the scheme lays a strong foundation for generic blockchain interoperability. For instance, it enables the development of an atomic-commit protocol for distributed transactions across blockchains.",

In public blockchain systems, users usually connect to third-party peers or run a peer to join the P2P blockchain network. However, connecting to unreliable blockchain peers will make users waste resources and even lose millions of dollars of cryptocurrencies. In order to select the reliable blockchain peers, it is urgently needed to evaluate and predict the reliability of them. Faced with this problem, we propose H-BRP, Hybrid Blockchain Reliability Prediction model to extract the blockchain reliability factors then make personalized prediction for each user. Large-scale real-world experiments are conducted on 100 blockchain requesters and 200 blockchain peers. The implement and dataset of 2,000,000 test cases are released. The experimental results show that the proposed model obtains better accuracy than other approaches.",

We identify common primitive elements of both and use them to construct a framework for explicitly articulating what characterizes blockchain networks. The framework consists of a set of questions that every blockchain initiative should address at the very outset. It is intended to help one decide whether or not blockchain is an appropriate approach to a particular application, and if it is, to assist in its initial design stage.",

    "abstract": "The fast developing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies provide a promising opportunity to build large-scale systems to connect numerous heterogeneous devices into the Internet. Most existing IIoT infrastructures are based on a centralized architecture, which is easier for management but cannot effectively support immutable and verifiable services among multiple parties. Blockchain technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT infrastructures, such as decentralization, trustworthiness, trackability, and immutability. This paper presents a blockchain-based IIoT architecture to support immutable and verifiable services. However, when applying blockchain technology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant challenge to resource-constrained IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain storage structure, \\textit{ChainSplitter}. Specially, the proposed architecture features a hierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored in the clouds, while the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network of the individual IIoT networks. The proposed architecture seamlessly binds local IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud infrastructure together through two connectors, the \\textit{blockchain connector} and the \\textit{cloud connector}, to construct the hierarchical blockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the overlay network builds blocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud connector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay network and the clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical blockchain storage in a practical Industrial IoT case.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain's evolution during the past decade is astonishing: from bitcoin to over 2.000 altcoins, and from decentralised electronic payments to transactions programmable by smart contracts and complex tokens governed by decentralised organisations. While the new generation of blockchain applications is still evolving, blockchain's technical characteristics are also advancing. Yet, immutability, a hitherto indisputable property according to which blockchain data cannot be edited nor deleted, remains the cornerstone of blockchain's security. Nevertheless, blockchain's immutability is being called into question lately in the light of the new erasing requirements imposed by the GDPR's ``\\textit{Right to be Forgotten (RtbF)}'' provision. As the RtbF obliges blockchain data to be editable in order restricted content redactions, modifications or deletions to be applied when requested, blockchains compliance with the regulation is indeed challenging, if not impracticable. Towards resolving this contradiction, various methods and techniques for mutable blockchains have been proposed in an effort to satisfy regulatory erasing requirements while preserving blockchains' security. To this end, this work aims to provide a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art research approaches, technical workarounds and advanced cryptographic techniques that have been put forward to resolve this conflict and to discuss their potentials, constraints and limitations when applied in the wild to either permissioned or permissionless blockchains.",

However, the performance of permissionless blockchains restricts the widespread of cryptocurrency. Recently, Libra was proposed by Facebook based on a permissioned blockchain, i.e. the Libra blockchain. The vision of Libra is to become a global currency supporting financial applications, but it is doubted whether the performance of the Libra blockchain is able to support frequent micropayment scenarios. In this paper, we propose a methodology to evaluate the performance of blockchain platforms and conducted an experimental study on the Libra blockchain. The results show that the Libra blockchain can only process about one thousand transactions per second at most, and the performance drops significantly as the number of validators increases. Although it outperforms permissionless blockchain platforms, the performance of the Libra blockchain is still unsatisfactory compared to other permissioned blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric and needs to make effective improvements in order to support global micropayment in the future.",

This paper proposes a new distributed commit protocol, namely \\textit{cross-blockchain transaction} (CBT), for conducting transactions across an arbitrary number of blockchains without any centralized component. The key idea of CBT is to extend the two-phase commit protocol with a heartbeat mechanism to ensure the liveness of CBT without introducing additional nodes or blockchains. We have implemented CBT and compared it to the state-of-the-art protocols, demonstrating CBT's low overhead (3.6\\% between two blockchains, less than $1\\%$ among 32 or more blockchains) and high scalability (linear scalability on up to 64-blockchain transactions). In addition, we developed a graphic user interface for users to virtually monitor the status of the cross-blockchain transactions.",

The current blockchain technology faces scalability issues, which include two aspects: low transaction throughput and high storage capacity costs. This paper studies the blockchain structure based on state sharding technology, and mainly solves the problem of non-scalability of block chain storage. This paper designs and implements the blockchain state sharding scheme, proposes a specific state sharding data structure and algorithm implementation, and realizes a complete blockchain structure so that the blockchain has the advantages of high throughput, processing a large number of transactions and saving storage costs. Experimental results show that a blockchain network with more than 100,000 nodes can be divided into 1024 shards. A blockchain network with this structure can process 500,000 transactions in about 5 seconds. If the consensus time of the blockchain is about 10 seconds, and the block generation time of the blockchain system of the sharding mechanism is 15 seconds, the transaction throughput can reach 33,000 tx/sec. Experimental results show that the throughput of the proposed protocol increases with the increase of the network node size. This confirms the scalability of the blockchain structure based on sharding technology.",

In such blockchains, new currency units are generated through the mining process and are used in addition to transaction fees to incentivize miners to maintain the blockchain. Although it is clear how currency units are generated and transacted on, it is unclear how to use the infrastructure of permissionless blockchains to manage other assets than the blockchain's currency units (e.g., cars, houses, etc). In this paper, we propose a global asset management system by unifying permissioned and permissionless blockchains. A governmental permissioned blockchain authenticates the registration of end-user assets through smart contract deployments on a permissionless blockchain. Afterwards, end-users can transact on their assets through smart contract function calls (e.g., sell a car, rent a room in a house, etc). In return, end-users get paid in currency units of the same blockchain or other blockchains through atomic cross-chain transactions and governmental offices receive taxes on these transactions in cryptocurrency units.",

In this paper, we propose segment blockchain, an approach that segmentises blockchain and enables nodes to only store a copy of one blockchain segment. We use \\emph{PoW} as a membership threshold to limit the number of nodes taken by an Adversary---the Adversary can only gain at most $n/2$ of nodes in a network of $n$ nodes when it has $50\\%$ of the calculation power in the system (the Nakamoto blockchain security threshold). A segment blockchain system fails when an Adversary stores all copies of a segment, because the Adversary can then leave the system, causing a permanent loss of the segment. We theoretically prove that segment blockchain can sustain a $(AD/n)^m$ failure probability when the Adversary has no more than $AD$ number of nodes and every segment is stored by $m$ number of nodes. The storage requirement is mostly shrunken compared to the traditional design and therefore making the blockchain more suitable for data-heavy applications.",

In this paper, we present a cross-blockchain asset transfer protocol that supports arbitrary assets, is adaptable to different means of cross-blockchain communication, and adheres to requirements such as finality. The ability to freely transfer assets between blockchains may increase transaction throughput and provide developers with more flexibility by allowing them to design digital assets that leverage the capacities and capabilities of multiple blockchains.",

    "abstract": "Public blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin provide transparency and accountability, and have strong non-repudiation properties, but fall far short of enterprise privacy requirements for business processes. Consequently consortiums are exploring private blockchains to keep their membership and transactions private. However, private blockchains do not provide adequate protection against potential collusion by consortium members to revert the state of the blockchain. To countenance this, the private blockchain state may be \"pinned\" to a tamper resistant public blockchain. Existing solutions offering pinning to the public blockchain would reveal the transaction rate of the private blockchain, and do not provide a mechanism to contest the validity of a pin. Moreover, they require that all transactions and members of the private blockchain be revealed. These challenges are hampering the wider adoption of private blockchain technology. We describe the primary author's `Anonymous State Pinning approach', which overcomes these limitations and present a security proof to demonstrate pins can be challenged without compromising these properties. We perform a gas cost analysis of the implementation to estimate the operating cost of this technology, which shows that pinning a private blockchain at the rate of one pin per hour would cost US$508 per year. A hierarchical pinning approach is proposed which would allow many private blockchains to pin to a management blockchain which would then pin to Ethereum MainNet. This approach saves money, but at the cost of increased finality times.",

    "abstract": "A Coordination Blockchain is a blockchain with the task of coordinating activities of multiple private blockchains. This paper discusses the pros and cons of using Ethereum MainNet, the public Ethereum blockchain, as a Coordination Blockchain. The requirements Ethereum MainNet needs to fulfil to perform this role are discussed within the context of Ethereum Private Sidechains, a private blockchain technology which allows many blockchains to be operated in parallel, and allows atomic crosschain transactions to execute across blockchains. Ethereum MainNet is a permissionless network which aims to offer strong authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation properties, that incentivises good behaviour using crypto economics. This paper demonstrates that Ethereum MainNet does deliver these properties. It then provides a comprehensive review of the features of Ethereum Private Sidechains, with a focus on the potential usage of Coordination Blockchains for these features. Finally, the merits of using Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain are assessed. For Ethereum Private Sidechains, we found that Ethereum MainNet is best suited to storing long term static data that needs to be widely available, such as the Ethereum Registration Authority information. However, due to Ethereum MainNet's probabilistic finality, it is not well suited to information that needs to be available and acted upon immediately, such as the Sidechain Public Keys and Atomic Crosschain Transaction state information that need to be accessible prior to the first atomic crosschain transaction being issued on a sidechain. Although this paper examined the use of Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain within reference to Ethereum Private Sidechains, the discussions and observations of the typical tasks a Coordination blockchain may be expected to perform are applicable more widely to any multi-blockchain system.",

However, in the case of popular blockchains, which each weigh several hundreds of GB, the large amount of data to be stored can incite new or low-capacity nodes to run lightweight clients. Such nodes do not participate to the global storage effort and can result in a centralization of the blockchain by very few nodes, which is contrary to the basic concepts of a blockchain. To avoid this problem, we propose new low storage nodes that store a reduced amount of data generated from the blockchain by using erasure codes. The properties of this technique ensure that any block of the chain can be easily rebuild from a small number of such nodes. This system should encourage low storage nodes to contribute to the storage of the blockchain and to maintain decentralization despite of a globally increasing size of the blockchain. This system paves the way to new types of blockchains which would only be managed by low capacity nodes.",

We further show that basic approaches to improving blockchain privacy also rely on embedding metadata. This paper identifies and classifies real-life blockchain transactions embedding metadata of a number of major protocols running essentially over the bitcoin blockchain. The empirical analysis here presents the evolution of metadata utilization in the recent years, and the discussion suggests steps towards preventing criminal use. Metadata are relevant to any blockchain, and our analysis considers primarily bitcoin as a case study. The paper concludes that simultaneously with both expanding legitimate utilization of embedded metadata and expanding blockchain functionality, the applied research on improving anonymity and security must also attempt to protect against blockchain abuse.",

We believe that if this complementarity is to be achieved blockchain and ontologies must co-evolve. In this paper, we focus on what and how to engineer models, methods, designs, and implementations for this co-evolution. As a first step in this co-evolution, we propose a conceptual design of a governance ontology represented as meta-data tags to be embedded and instantiated in a smart contract at the blockchain protocol level. We develop this design by examining and analyzing smart contracts from the infamous The DAO experiment on the Ethereum blockchain. We believe there are two contributions of this paper: it serves to inform and implore the blockchain and ontology communities to recognize and collaborate with each other; and it outlines a roadmap for engineering artifacts to bridge the gap between blockchain community focus on protocol-level blockchain interoperability and the ontology community focus on semantic-level interoperability.",

In this paper, we present HyperService, the first platform that delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of HyperService in about 35,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality.

The cross-blockchain protocol can be used to develop services where end-users decide for themselves their most preferred blockchain. The invention solves problems of duplication of tokens in the result of hardforks, issues with scalability, digital identity and even the \"problem\" of immutability (enforceability). A cross-blockchain DB means a consistent non-conflicting key-value database across a bunch of defined blockchains. It is not a new blockchain, but a protocol for developing databases on existing blockchains.

    "abstract": "Consensus protocols are currently the bottlenecks that prevent blockchain systems from scaling. However, we argue that transaction execution is also important to the performance and security of blockchains. In other words, there are ample opportunities to speed up and further secure blockchains by reducing the cost of transaction execution. Our goal is to understand how much we can speed up blockchains by exploiting transaction concurrency available in blockchain workloads. To this end, we first analyze historical data of seven major public blockchains, namely Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Zilliqa. We consider two metrics for concurrency, namely the single-transaction conflict rate per block, and the group conflict rate per block. We find that there is more concurrency in UTXO-based blockchains than in account-based ones, although the amount of concurrency in the former is lower than expected. Another interesting finding is that some blockchains with larger blocks have more concurrency than blockchains with smaller blocks. Next, we propose an analytical model for estimating the transaction execution speed-up given an amount of concurrency. Using results from our empirical analysis, the model estimates that 6x speed-ups in Ethereum can be achieved if all available concurrency is exploited.",

This paper presents a technique to allow blockchain interoperability. The core idea is to provide a primitive operation to developers so that contracts and objects can switch from one blockchain to another, without breaking consistency and violating key blockchain properties. To validate our ideas, we implemented our protocol in two popular blockchain clients that use the Ethereum virtual machine. We discuss how to build applications using the proposed protocol and show examples of applications based on real use cases that can move across blockchains.

    "abstract": "The long-standing impossibility of reaching agreement restricts the lifespan of blockchains. In fact, the consensus on a block to be appended to any blockchain succeeds either with some probability or at the condition that two thirds of the $n$ replicas are not Byzantine. In the former case, the probability that the blockchain fails grows exponentially with the number of newly appended blocks. In the latter case, the blockchain fails as soon as a coalition bribes $f=n/3$ replicas. As a result, one may wonder whether blockchains are doomed to fail. In this paper, we answer this question in the negative by proposing the first Longlasting Blockchain system, \\emph{LLB}. LLB builds upon the observation that blockchains are rarely subject to benign faults. As opposed to probabilistic blockchains, LLB solves consensus deterministically when $f<n/3$. As opposed to Byzantine fault tolerant blockchains, it resolves a series of disagreements by reducing eventually the number of deceitful replicas from $n/3\\leq f<2n/3$ to $f'<n'/3$ among a new set of $n'$ replicas. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we implement two coalition attacks and a zero loss payment application that forces replicas that misbehave to reimburse conflicting transactions. Finally, LLB outperforms the raw state machine replication at the heart of Facebook's Libra and achieves performance comparable to a scalable blockchain that cannot tolerate $n/3$ failures.",

In this paper, we offer a simple method of constructing redactable blockchains inspired by the ideas underlying the well-known RSA encryption scheme. Notably, our method can be used in conjunction with any reasonable hash function that is used to build a blockchain. Public immutability of a blockchain in our construction is based on the computational hardness of the RSA problem and not on properties of the underlying hash function. Corruption resistance is based on the computational hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.",

Blockchain Layer 2 technologies such as the one described in this paper require no such changes. They operate on top of the infrastructure provided by the blockchain platform software. This paper introduces the protocol and a more scalable variant, provides an initial safety and liveness analysis, and presents the expected overhead of using this technology when compared to using multiple non-atomic single blockchain transactions. The overhead is analysed for three scenarios involving multiple blockchains: the Hotel and Train problem, Supply Chain with Provenance, and an Oracle. The protocol is shown to provide 93.8 or 186 cross-blockchain function calls per second for the Hotel and Train scenario when there are many travel agencies, for the standard and scalable variant of the protocol respectively, given the Ethereum client, Hyperledger Besu's performance of 375 tps, assuming a block period of one second, and assuming all transactions take the same amount of time to execute as the benchmark transactions.",

Beyond mere academic curiosity, a positive response would raise concerns about the likelihood of Bitcoin/blockchain entering a 2010-Flash-Crash-type of chaotic regime, with catastrophic consequences for financial systems based on it. The paper starts by highlighting the relevant details of the Bitcoin/blockchain ecosystem formed by the blockchain itself, bitcoin end users (payers and payees), capital gains seekers, miners, full nodes maintainers, and developers, and their interactions. Then the Information Theory of Complex Systems is briefly discussed for later use. Finally, the blockchain is investigated with the help of Crutchfield's Statistical Complexity measure. The low non-null statistical complexity value obtained suggests that the blockchain may be considered algorithmically complicated but hardly a complex system and unlikely to enter a chaotic regime.",

    "abstract": "Open-access blockchains based on proof-of-work protocols have gained tremendous popularity for their capabilities of providing decentralized tamper-proof ledgers and platforms for data-driven autonomous organization. Nevertheless, the proof-of-work based consensus protocols are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as double-spending. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of cyber risk management for blockchain-based service. In particular, we adopt the cyber-insurance as an economic tool for neutralizing cyber risks due to attacks in blockchain networks. We consider a blockchain service market, which is composed of the infrastructure provider, the blockchain provider, the cyber-insurer, and the users. The blockchain provider purchases from the infrastructure provider, e.g., a cloud, the computing resources to maintain the blockchain consensus, and then offers blockchain services to the users. The blockchain provider strategizes its investment in the infrastructure and the service price charged to the users, in order to improve the security of the blockchain and thus optimize its profit. Meanwhile, the blockchain provider also purchases a cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer to protect itself from the potential damage due to the attacks. In return, the cyber-insurer adjusts the insurance premium according to the perceived risk level of the blockchain service. Based on the assumption of rationality for the market entities, we model the interaction among the blockchain provider, the users, and the cyber-insurer as a two-level Stackelberg game. Namely, the blockchain provider and the cyber-insurer lead to set their pricing/investment strategies, and then the users follow to determine their demand of the blockchain service. Specifically, we consider the scenario of double-spending attacks and provide a series of analytical results about the Stackelberg equilibrium in the market game.",

Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a promising solution to improve the productivity of blockchain application development. However, existing BaaS deployment solutions are mostly vendor-locked: they are either bound to a cloud provider or a blockchain platform. In addition to deployment, design and implementation of blockchain-based applications is a hard task requiring deep expertise. Therefore, this paper presents a unified blockchain as a service platform (uBaaS) to support both design and deployment of blockchain-based applications. The services in uBaaS include deployment as a service, design pattern as a service and auxiliary services. In uBaaS, deployment as a service is platform agnostic, which can avoid lock-in to specific cloud platforms, while design pattern as a service applies design patterns for data management and smart contract design to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain. The proposed solutions are evaluated using a real-world quality tracing use case in terms of feasibility and scalability.",

We accomplish this goal by using grounded theory (a structured approach to gathering and analyzing qualitative data) to thoroughly analyze a large corpus of literature on Blockchain technology. This method enables us to answer the above questions while limiting researcher bias, separating thought leadership from peddled hype and identifying open research questions related to Blockchain technology.

As enterprises begin to adopt blockchain technology to solve business problems, there are valid concerns if blockchain applications can support the transactional demands of production systems. In fact, the multiple distributed components and protocols that underlie blockchain applications makes performance optimization a non-trivial task. Blockchain performance optimization and scalability require a methodology to reduce complexity and cost. Furthermore, existing performance results often lack the requirements, load, and infrastructure of a production application. In this paper, we first develop a methodical approach to performance tuning enterprise blockchain applications to increase performance and transaction capacity. The methodology is applied to an enterprise blockchain-based application (leveraging Hyperledger Fabric) for performance tuning and optimization with the goal of bridging the gap between laboratory and production deployed system performance. We then present extensive results and analysis of our performance testing for on-premise and cloud deployments, in which we were able to scale the application from 30 to 3000 TPS without forking the Hyperledger Fabric source code and maintaining a reasonable infrastructure footprint. We also provide blockchain application and platform recommendations for performance improvement.",

While some effort has recently been made to developing hierarchically distributed commit protocols to make multi-party transactions progress, there is no systematic method to reason about the transaction outcome. This paper tackles this problem from a perspective of point-set topology. We construct multiple topological spaces for the transactions and blockchain forks, and show that these spaces are internally related through either homeomorphism or continuous functions. Combined together, these tools allow us to reason about the cross-blockchain transactions through the growing-fork topology, an intuitive representation of blockchains.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger with wide applications. Due to the increasing storage requirement for blockchains, the computation can be afforded by only a few miners. Sharding has been proposed to scale blockchains so that storage and transaction efficiency of the blockchain improves at the cost of security guarantee. This paper aims to consider a new protocol, Secure-Repair-Blockchain (SRB), which aims to decrease the storage cost at the miners. In addition, SRB also decreases the bootstrapping cost, which allows for new miners to easily join a sharded blockchain. In order to reduce storage, coding-theoretic techniques are used in SRB. In order to decrease the amount of data that is transferred to the new node joining a shard, the concept of exact repair secure regenerating codes is used. The proposed blockchain protocol achieves lower storage than those that do not use coding, and achieves lower bootstrapping cost as compared to the different baselines.",

    "abstract": "Services computing can offer a high-level abstraction to support diverse applications via encapsulating various computing infrastructures. Though services computing has greatly boosted the productivity of developers, it is faced with three main challenges: privacy and security risks, information silo, and pricing mechanisms and incentives. The recent advances of blockchain bring opportunities to address the challenges of services computing due to its build-in encryption as well as digital signature schemes, decentralization feature, and intrinsic incentive mechanisms. In this paper, we present a survey to investigate the integration of blockchain with services computing. The integration of blockchain with services computing mainly exhibits merits in two aspects: i) blockchain can potentially address key challenges of services computing and ii) services computing can also promote blockchain development. In particular, we categorize the current literature of services computing based on blockchain into five types: services creation, services discovery, services recommendation, services composition, and services arbitration. Moreover, we generalize Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) architecture and summarize the representative BaaS platforms. In addition, we also outline open issues of blockchain-based services computing and BaaS.",

    "abstract": "The constantly growing size of blockchains becomes a challenge with the increasing usage. Especially the storage of unwanted data in a blockchain is an issue, because it cannot be removed naturally. In order to counteract this problem, we present the first concept for the selective deletion of single entries in a blockchain. For this purpose, the general consensus algorithm is extended by the functionality of regularly creating summary blocks. Previous data of the chain are summarized and stored again in a new block, leaving out unwanted information. With a shifting marker of the Genesis Block, data can be deleted from the beginning of a blockchain. In this way, the technology of the blockchain becomes fully transactional. The concept is independent of a specific block structure, network structure, or consensus algorithm. Moreover, this functionality can be adapted to current blockchains to solve multiple problems related to scalability. This approach enables the transfer of blockchain technology to further fields of application, among others in the area of Industry 4.0 and Product Life-cycle Management.",

Such transactions allow not only funds to be transferred from one blockchain to another (as done in atomic swaps), but also a blockchain to verify the inclusion of any event on another blockchain. Cross-chain bridges are protocols that allow on-chain exchange of cryptocurrencies, on-chain transfer of assets to sidechains, and cross-shard verification of events in sharded blockchains, many of which rely on Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) for scalability. Unfortunately, existing bridge protocols that can transfer funds from a BFT blockchain incur significant computation overhead on the destination blockchain, resulting in a high gas cost for smart contract verification of events. In this paper, we propose Horizon, a gas-efficient, cross-chain bridge protocol to transfer assets from a BFT blockchain to another blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) that supports basic smart contract execution.",

    "abstract": "Modern blockchain systems are a fresh look at the paradigm of distributed computing, applied under assumptions of large-scale public networks. They can be used to store and share information without a trusted central party. There has been much effort to develop blockchain systems for a myriad of uses, ranging from cryptocurrencies to identity control, supply chain management, etc. None of this work has directly studied the fundamental database issues that arise when using blockchains as the underlying infrastructure to manage data. The key difference between using blockchains to store data and centrally controlled databases is that transactions are accepted to a blockchain via a consensus mechanism. Hence, once a user has issued a transaction, she cannot be certain if it will be accepted. Moreover, a yet unaccepted transaction cannot be retracted by the user, and may be appended to the blockchain in the future. This causes difficulties as the user may wish to reissue a transaction, if it was not accepted. Yet this data may then become appended twice to the blockchain. In this paper we present a database perspective on blockchains by introducing formal foundations for blockchains as a storage layer that underlies a database. The main issue that we tackle is uncertainty in transaction appending that is a result of the consensus mechanism. We study two flavors of transaction appending problems: (1) the complexity of determining whether it is possible for a denial constraint to be contradicted, given the state of the blockchain, pending transactions, and integrity constraints and (2) the complexity of generating transactions that are mutually (in)consistent with given subsets of pending transactions. Solving these problems is critical to ensure that users can issue transactions consistent with their intentions. Finally, we chart important directions for future work.",

    "abstract": "Governments across the world are testing different uses of the blockchain for the delivery of their public services. Blockchain hashing - or the insertion of data in the blockchain - is one of the potential applications of the blockchain in this space. With this method, users can apply special scripts to add their data to blockchain transactions, ensuring both immutability and publicity. Blockchain hashing also secures the integrity of the original data stored on central governmental databases. The paper starts by analysing possible scenarios of hashing on the blockchain and assesses in which cases it may work and in which it is less likely to add value to a public administration. Second, the paper also compares this method with traditional digital signatures using PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and discusses standardisation in each domain. Third, it also addresses issues related to concepts such as distributed ledger technology and permissioned blockchains. Finally, it raises the question of whether blockchain hashing is an effective solution for electronic governance, and concludes that its value is controversial, even if it is improved by PKI and other security measures. In this regard, we claim that governments need first to identify pain points in governance, and then consider the trade-offs of the blockchain as a potential solution versus other alternatives.",

Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin like online transactions. Then we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques and systems.",

Blockchain works over the principle of distributed, secured, and shared ledger, which is used to record, and track data within a decentralized network. This technology has successfully replaced certain systems of economic transactions in organizations and has the potential to overtake various industrial business models in future. Blockchain works over peer-to-peer (P2P) phenomenon for its operation and does not require any trusted-third party authorization for data tracking and storage. The information stored in blockchain is distributed throughout the decentralized network and is usually protected using cryptographic hash functions. Since the beginning of blockchain technology, its use in different applications is increasing exponentially, but this increased use has also raised some questions regarding privacy and security of data being stored in it. Protecting privacy of blockchain data using data perturbation strategy such as differential privacy could be a novel approach to overcome privacy issues in blockchain. In this article, we cover the topic of integration of differential privacy in each layer of blockchain and in certain blockchain based scenarios. Moreover, we highlight some future challenges and application scenarios in which integration of differential privacy in blockchain can produce fruitful results.",

    "abstract": "Transactions represent a fundamental component in blockchains as they are the primary means for users to change the blockchain state. Current blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum require users to constantly observe the state changes of interest or the events taking place in a blockchain and requires the user to explicitly release the required transactions to respond to the observed events in the blockchain. This paper proposes EventWarden, a decentralized event-driven proxy service for users to outsource transactions in Ethereum-like blockchains. EventWarden employs a novel combination of smart contracts and blockchain logs. EventWarden allows a user to create a proxy smart contract that specifies an interested event and also reserves an arbitrary transaction to release. Upon observing the occurrence of the prescribed event, anyone in the Blockchain network can call the proxy contract to earn the service fee reserved in the contract by proving to the contract that the event has been recorded into blockchain logs, which then automatically triggers the proxy contract to release the reserved transaction. We show that the reserved transaction can only get released from the proxy contract when the prescribed event has taken place. We also demonstrate that as long as a single member in the Blockchain network is incentivized by the service fee to call the proxy contract after the prescribed event has taken place, the reserved transaction is guaranteed to get released. We implement EventWarden over the Ethereum official test network. The results demonstrate that EventWarden is effective and is ready-to-use in practice.",

Despite the interest in using blockchain for healthcare interoperability, however, little information is available on the concrete architectural styles and patterns for applying blockchain to healthcare apps. This paper provides an initial step in filling this gap by showing: (1) the features and implementation challenges in healthcare interoperability, (2) an end-to-end case study of a blockchain-based healthcare app we are developing, and (3) how applying foundational software patterns can help address common interoperability challenges faced by blockchain-based healthcare apps.",

A ledger comprises series of blocks, which in turns contains a series of transactions. An identical copy of the ledger is stored on all nodes in a blockchain network. Maintaining ledger integrity and security is one of the crucial design aspects of any blockchain platform. Thus, there are typically built-in validation mechanisms leveraging cryptography to ensure the validity of incoming blocks before committing them into the ledger. However, a blockchain node may run over an extended period of time, during which the blocks on the disk can may become corrupted due to software or hardware failures, or due to malicious activity. This paper proposes LedgerGuard, a tool to maintain ledger integrity by detecting corrupted blocks and recovering these blocks by synchronizing with rest of the network.

To this end, we list important properties of the Ethereum public blockchain topology, we deploy VMs with constrained CPU quantum to mimic the top-10 mining pools of Ethereum and we develop full-fledged attacks, that first partition the network through BGP hijacking or ARP spoofing before issuing a Balance Attack to steal coins. Our results demonstrate that attacking Ethereum is remarkably devastating in a consortium or private context as the adversary can multiply her digital assets by 200, 000x in 10 hours through BGP hijacking whereas it would be almost impossible in a public context.",

Although blockchain has been widely adopted in many applications, e.g., finance, healthcare, and logistics, its application in mobile services is still limited. This is due to the fact that blockchain users need to solve preset proof-of-work puzzles to add new data, i.e., a block, to the blockchain. Solving the proof-of-work, however, consumes substantial resources in terms of CPU time and energy, which is not suitable for resource-limited mobile devices. To facilitate blockchain applications in future mobile Internet of Things systems, multiple access mobile edge computing appears to be an auspicious solution to solve the proof-of-work puzzles for mobile users. We first introduce a novel concept of edge computing for mobile blockchain. Then, we introduce an economic approach for edge computing resource management.

    "abstract": "Many studies have been done to improve the performance of centrally controlled business processes and enhance the integration between different parties of these collaborations. However, the most serious issues of collaborative business processes remained unsolved in these studies, lack of trust and divided data on various confidential ledgers. Blockchain technology has enormous potential to become a new substantial integration method for untrusted collaborative businesses. Using the governing consensus mechanism, blockchain eliminates the necessity of the trusted third party. It provides a distributed shared ledger which facilitates the job of the process monitoring for the parties. The smart contract, as a crucial tool, is used to define the guaranteed autonomous programs. In addition, the privacy of the data can be ensured by using a permissioned blockchain that handles the access control because in this way, only verifiable participants can have access to the state of the business process and its related information. In this study, the applicability of execution of a real-word untrusted business process on the permissioned blockchain is investigated. Moreover, we determine the advantages of using the permissioned access-controller blockchain as the infrastructure for the collaborative business processes, through implementing the process of Order Processing on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a random network model for blockchains, a distributed hierarchical data structure of blocks that has found several applications in various industries. The model is parametric on two probability distribution functions governing block production and communication delay, which are key to capture the complexity of the mechanism used to synchronize the many distributed local copies of a blockchain. The proposed model is equipped with simulation algorithms for both bounded and unbounded number of distributed copies of the blockchain. They are used to study fast blockchain systems, i.e., blockchains in which the average time of block production can match the average time of message broadcasting used for blockchain synchronization. In particular, the model and the algorithms are useful to understand efficiency criteria associated with fast blockchains for identifying, e.g., when increasing the block production will have negative impact on the stability of the distributed data structure given the network's broadcast delay.",

    "abstract": "To implement a blockchain, the trend is now to integrate a non-trivial Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm instead of the seminal idea of waiting to receive blocks to decide upon the longest branch. After a decade of existence, blockchains trade now large amounts of valuable assets and a simple disagreement could lead to disastrous losses. Unfortunately, Byzantine consensus solutions used in blockchains are at best proved correct \"by hand\" as we are not aware of any of them having been formally verified. In this paper, we propose two contributions: (i) we illustrate the severity of the problem by listing six vulnerabilities of blockchain consensus including two new counter-examples; (ii) we then formally verify two Byzantine fault tolerant components of Red Belly Blockchain using the ByMC model checker. First, we specify a simple broadcast primitive in 116 lines of code that is verified in 40 seconds on a 2-core Intel machine. Then, we specify a blockchain consensus algorithm in 276 lines of code that is verified in 17 minutes on a 64-core AMD machine using MPI. To conclude, we argue that it has now become both relatively simple and crucial to formally verify the correctness of blockchain consensus protocols.",

In this paper, we describe our vision of interoperable blockchains. We argue that supporting interaction among different blockchains requires overcoming challenges that go beyond data standardization. The underlying problem is to allow smart contracts running in different blockchains to communicate. We discuss three open problems: access control, general cross-chain transactions, and cross-chain communication. We describe partial solutions to some of these problems in the literature. Finally, we propose a novel design to overcome these challenges.",

They provide strong consistency (no fork) under classical assumptions, and avoid using energy-consuming mechanisms to add new blocks in the blockchain. For each block, these blockchains use a committee that executes Byzantine-fault tolerant distributed consensus to decide the next block they will add in the blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin, where there is only one creator per block with high probability, in committee-based blockchain any block is cooperatively created. In order to incentivize committee members to participate to the creation of new blocks rewarding schemes have to be designed. In this paper, we study the fairness of rewarding in committee-based blockchains and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the system communication under which it is possible to have a fair reward mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Despite the popularity and practical applicability of blockchains, there is very limited work on the theoretical foundation of blockchains: The lack of rigorous theory and analysis behind the curtain of blockchains has severely staggered its broader applications. This paper attempts to lay out a theoretical foundation for a specific type of blockchains---the ones requiring basic authenticity from the participants, also called \\textit{permissioned blockchain}. We formulate permissioned blockchain systems and operations into a game-theoretical problem by incorporating constraints implied by the wisdom from distributed computing and Byzantine systems. We show that in a noncooperative blockchain game (NBG), a Nash equilibrium can be efficiently found in a closed-form even though the game involves more than two players. Somewhat surprisingly, the simulation results of the Nash equilibrium implies that the game can reach a stable status regardless of the number of Byzantine nodes and trustworthy players. We then study a harder problem where players are allowed to form coalitions: the coalitional blockchain game (CBG). We show that although the Shapley value for a CBG can be expressed in a more succinct form, its core is empty.",

This paper quantifies the scalability issues and bottlenecks related to current blockchains and puts into perspective the limitations blockchains have with supporting healthcare systems. Particularly we show that well known blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and IOTA cannot support transactions of a large scale hospital system such as the University of Kentucky HealthCare system and leave over 7.5M unsealed transactions per day. We then discuss how bottlenecks of blockchains can be relieved with sidechains, enabling well-known blockchains to support even larger hospital systems of over 30M transactions per day. We then introduce the Patient-Healthchain architecture to provide future direction on how scaling blockchains for EHR systems with sidechains can be achieved.",

To improve certain aspects, e.g., energy consumption and latency, of traditional blockchains, different architectures, algorithms, and data management methods have been recently proposed. For example, appendable-block blockchain uses a different data structure designed to reduce latency in block and transaction insertion. It is especially applicable in domains such as Internet of Things (IoT), where both latency and energy are key concerns. However, the lack of some features available to other blockchains, such as Smart Contracts, limits the application of this model. To solve this, in this work, we propose the use of Smart Contracts in appendable-block blockchain through a new model called context-based appendable-block blockchain. This model also allows the execution of multiple smart contracts in parallel, featuring high performance in parallel computing scenarios. Furthermore, we present an implementation for the context-based appendable-block blockchain using an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Finally, we execute this implementation in four different testbed. The results demonstrated a performance improvement for parallel processing of smart contracts when using the proposed model.",

So each media recording has its own unique blockchain, with each block holding information describing the media segment. The problem of verifying the integrity of the media is recast to traversing the blockchain, block-by-block, and segment-by-segment of the media.

The protocol operates on existing Ethereum blockchains without modification. It works for both public permissioned and consortium blockchains. Additionally, the protocol is expected to work across heterogeneous blockchains other than Ethereum. The protocol has been analysed in terms of Gas usage and Finalised Block Periods for three scenarios: reading a value from one blockchain to another, writing a value from one blockchain to another, and a trade finance system involving five contracts on five blockchains with a complex call graph. The initial security analysis of the protocol shows that the protocol has Safety and Liveness properties. The high gas costs and the latency of the current implementation provide a base line upon which implementation improvements of this protocol and future protocols can be measured.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized blockchain platforms have enabled the secure exchange of crypto-assets without the intermediation of trusted authorities. To this purpose, these platforms rely on a peer-to-peer network of byzantine nodes, which collaboratively maintain an append-only ledger of transactions, called blockchain. Transactions represent the actions required by users, e.g. the transfer of some units of crypto-currency to another user, or the invocation of a smart contract which distributes some crypto-assets according to a complex logic. Part of the nodes of the peer-to-peer network append blocks of transactions to the blockchain. To do so, they group the transactions sent by users into blocks, and update their view of the blockchain state by executing these transactions in the chosen order. Once a block of transactions is appended to the blockchain, the other nodes validate it, re-executing the transactions in the same order. The serial execution of transactions does not take advantage of the multi-core architecture of modern processors, so contributing to limit the throughput. In this paper we develop a theory of transaction parallelism for blockchains, which exploits static analysis of transactions and smart contracts to improve the performance of blockchain platforms.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a relatively new technology that can be seen as a decentralised database. Blockchain systems heavily rely on cryptographic hash functions to store their data, which makes it difficult to tamper with any data stored in the system. A topic that was researched along with blockchain is image authentication. Image authentication focuses on investigating and maintaining the integrity of images. As a blockchain system can be useful for maintaining data integrity, image authentication has the potential to be enhanced by blockchain. There are many techniques that can be used to authenticate images; the technique investigated by this work is image hashing. Image hashing is a technique used to calculate how similar two different images are. This is done by converting the images into hashes and then comparing them using a distance formula. To investigate the topic, an experiment involving a simulated blockchain was created. The blockchain acted as a database for images. This blockchain was made up of devices which contained their own unique image hashing algorithms. The blockchain was tested by creating modified copies of the images contained in the database, and then submitting them to the blockchain to see if it will return the original image. Through this experiment it was discovered that it is plausible to create an image authentication system using blockchain and image hashing. However, the design proposed by this work requires refinement, as it appears to struggle in some situations. This work shows that blockchain can be a suitable approach for authenticating images, particularly via image hashing. Other observations include that using multiple image hash algorithms at the same time can increase performance in some cases, as well as that each type of test done to the blockchain has its own unique pattern to its data.",

To understand how sharding would affect Ethereum, we model Ethereum blockchain as a graph and evaluate five methods to partition the graph.

    "abstract": "Decentralization, which has backed the hyper growth of many blockchains, comes at the cost of scalability. To understand this fundamental limitation, this paper proposes a quantitative measure of blockchain decentralization, and discusses its implications to various trust models and consensus algorithms. Further, we identify the major challenges in blockchain decentralization. Our key findings are that true decentralization is hard to achieve due to the skewed mining power and that a fully decentralized blockchain inherently limits scalability as it incurs a throughput upper bound and prevents scaling smart contract execution. To address these challenges, we outline three research directions to explore the trade-offs between decentralization and scalability.",

However, these data on nodes are uncoded (transparent). Thus, the proposed algorithm not only keeps decentralization and security, but also has good scalability in independency and recovery.",

In this paper, we formalize metatransactions, review existing ideas, and describe novel metatransaction design approaches. Under the assumption of sufficient market liquidity, we argue that metatransactions do not lower the security of cryptocurrency platforms.

This allows for instantaneous detection of erroneous fragments and thus avoids decoding with wrong data.

    "abstract": "A smart contract on a blockchain cannot keep a secret because its data is replicated on all nodes in a network. To remedy this problem, it has been suggested to combine blockchains with trusted execution environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX, for executing applications that demand privacy. Untrusted blockchain nodes cannot get access to the data and computations inside the TEE. This paper first explores some pitfalls that arise from the combination of TEEs with blockchains. Since TEEs are, in principle, stateless they are susceptible to rollback attacks, which should be prevented to maintain privacy for the application. However, in blockchains with non-final consensus protocols, such as the proof-of-work in Ethereum and others, the contract execution must handle rollbacks by design. This implies that TEEs for securing blockchain execution cannot be directly used for such blockchains; this approach works only when the consensus decisions are final. Second, this work introduces an architecture and a prototype for smart-contract execution within Intel SGX technology for Hyperledger Fabric, a prominent platform for enterprise blockchain applications. Our system resolves difficulties posed by the execute-order-validate architecture of Fabric and prevents rollback attacks on TEE-based execution as far as possible. For increasing security, our design encapsulates each application on the blockchain within its own enclave that shields it from the host system. An evaluation shows that the overhead moving execution into SGX is within 10%-20% for a sealed-bid auction application.",

The Blockchain-based eHealth system becomes popular because of its unique distributed tamper-resistant and privacy-preserving features. However, due to the security issues of the blockchain system, there are many security risks in eHealth systems utilizing the blockchain technology. i.e. 51% attacks can destroy blockchain-based systems. Besides, trivial transactions and frequent calls of smart contracts in the blockchain system bring additional costs and security risks to blockchain-based eHealth systems. Worse still, electronic medical records (EMRs) are controlled by medical institutions rather than patients, which causes privacy leakage issues. In this paper, we propose a medical data Sharing and Privacy-preserving eHealth system based on blockChain technology (SPChain). We combine RepuCoin with the SNARKs-based chameleon hash function to resist underlying blockchain attacks, and design a new chain structure to make microblocks contribute to the weight of blockchain. The system allows patients to share their EMRs among different medical institutions in a privacy-preserving way. Besides, authorized medical institutions can label wrong EMRs with the patients' permissions in the case of misdiagnosis. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed system can provide a strong security guarantee with a high efficiency.",

However, there are some challenges in the implementation of blockchain technology. This chapter first explains the concept of blockchain technology and the data that we can store therein. The main advantage of blockchain is the security services that it provides. This section continues by describing these services.. The challenges of blockchain; blockchain anomalies, energy consumption, speed, scalability, interoperability, privacy and cryptology in the age of quantum computing are described. Selected solutions for these challenges are given. Remarkable derivatives of blockchain, which use different solutions (directed acyclic graph, distributed hash table, gossip consensus protocol) to solve some of these challenges are described. Then the data storage in blockchain and evolving data solutions are explained. The comparison of decentralized solutions with the lcentralized database systems is given. A multi-platform interoperable scalable architecture (MPISA) is proposed. In the conclusion we include the evolution assumptions of data storage in a decentralized world.",

The significantly high prices of digital currencies and initial coin offerings as the new funding approach has fostered the public perception of blockchain as a cure-all and driven the hype even further. In this evolution, a clear view of the reasonable application of blockchain technology is not given and therefore, the purposeful use of traditional technologies is undermined. To clarify this situation, we derive a novel decision model for evaluating the applicability of blockchain technology that considers two key factors: the remediation of central governance and the management of digital objects. Based on these key factors, we closely analyse the domain of identity management for conscious blockchain application. Finally, we examine uPort, Sovrin, and ShoCard as distinct projects in this scope with regard to the inevitable necessity to implement a blockchain by using our decision model.",

    "abstract": "Recently, decentralised (on-blockchain) platforms have emerged to complement centralised (off-blockchain) platforms for the implementation of automated, digital (smart) contracts. However, neither alternative can individually satisfy the requirements of a large class of applications. On-blockchain platforms suffer from scalability, performance, transaction costs and other limitations. Off-blockchain platforms are afflicted by drawbacks due to their dependence on single trusted third parties. We argue that in several application areas, hybrid platforms composed from the integration of on- and off-blockchain platforms are more able to support smart contracts that deliver the desired quality of service (QoS). Hybrid architectures are largely unexplored. To help cover the gap, in this paper we discuss the implementation of smart contracts on hybrid architectures. As a proof of concept, we show how a smart contract can be split and executed partially on an off-blockchain contract compliance checker and partially on the Rinkeby Ethereum network. To test the solution, we expose it to sequences of contractual operations generated mechanically by a contract validator tool.",

    "abstract": "The rise of blockchain technologies has given a boost to social good projects, which are trying to exploit various characteristic features of blockchains: the quick and inexpensive transfer of cryptocurrency, the transparency of transactions, the ability to tokenize any kind of assets, and the increase in trustworthiness due to decentralization. However, the swift pace of innovation in blockchain technologies, and the hype that has surrounded their \"disruptive potential\", make it difficult to understand whether these technologies are applied correctly, and what one should expect when trying to apply them to social good projects. This paper addresses these issues, by systematically analysing a collection of 120 blockchain-enabled social good projects. Focussing on measurable and objective aspects, we try to answer various relevant questions: which features of blockchains are most commonly used? Do projects have success in fund raising? Are they making appropriate choices on the blockchain architecture? How many projects are released to the public, and how many are eventually abandoned?",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the most extensive evaluation of blockchain system to date. To achieve scalability across servers in more than 10 countries located on 4 different continents, we drastically revisited Byzantine fault tolerant blockchains and verification of signatures. The resulting blockchain, called the Red Belly Blockchain (RBBC), commits more than a hundred thousand transactions issued by permissionless nodes. These transactions are grouped into blocks within few seconds through a partially synchronous consensus run by permissioned nodes. It prevents double spending by guaranteeing that a unique block is decided at any given index of the chain in a deterministic way by all participants. We compared the performance of RBBC against traditional Byzantine fault tolerant alternatives and more recent randomized solutions. In the same geo-distributed environment with low-end machines, we noticed two interesting comparisons: (i) the RBBC throughput scales to hundreds of machines whereas the classic 3-step leader-based BFT state machine used by consortium blockchains cannot scale to 40 identically configured nodes; (ii) RBBC guarantees transaction finality in 3 seconds and experiences a third of the latency that randomized-based solutions like HoneyBadgerBFT can offer. This empirical evaluation demonstrates that blockchain scalability can be achieved without sacrificing security.",

Unlike the existing simulators, SimBlock can easily change behavior of node, so that it enables to investigate the influence of nodes' behavior on blockchains. We compared some simulation results with the measured values in actual blockchains to demonstrate the validity of this simulator. Furthermore, to show practical usage, we conducted two experiments which clarify the influence of neighbor node selection algorithms and relay networks on the block propagation time. The simulator could depict the effects of the two techniques on block propagation time. The simulator will be publicly available in a few months.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of blockchain technologies, the idea of decentralized applications has gained traction. Smart contracts permit the implementation of application logic to foster distributed systems that are capable of removing intermediaries. Hereby, lock in effects originating from isolated data storage and central authorities are mitigated. Yet, smart contracts deployed to a ledger generate dependencies on the underlying blockchain. Over time, requirements regarding contract execution may detach from the utilized chain due to contradicting incentives and security or performance issues. To avoid a novel form of lock in effect towards a host blockchain, we introduce a concept for smart contract portability that permits any user to migrate contract logic and state between blockchains in a flexible and verifiable manner. As the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is supported by a multitude of blockchain implementations, it poses a common execution environment for smart contracts. We provide a toolbox that facilitates smart contract portability between EVM-compatible blockchains without trust requirements in the entity executing the migration process. To prove the concept's soundness, we transfer token contracts based on the ERC20 standard as well as applications containing dependencies to other smart contracts. Our evaluation shows the validity of ported applications including their current states.",

    "abstract": "We define and examine the shutdown problem for blockchain systems: how to gracefully end the system's operation at the end of its useful life. A particular focus is those blockchain systems that hold archival data of long-lived interest. We outline what it means to achieve a successful shutdown, and compare those criteria to likely end-of-life conditions in a generic blockchain system. We conclude that the decentralized nature of blockchain systems makes shutdown difficult, particularly if the system uses an unstable consensus like the Nakamoto consensus of Bitcoin. Accordingly, we recommend against using blockchain with unstable consensus for any data whose value is likely to persist beyond the life of the blockchain system. For any such systems that are already in operation, we recommend considering a hard fork to implement stable consensus. Such consideration needs to happen well in advance of the system's end of life.",

Consensus nodes enforce access control to the shared permissioned blockchain by a simple look-up to a (read-only) list of anonymous members' public-keys. ChainAnchor also provides unlinkability of transactions belonging to an entity on the blockchain. This allows for an entity to optionally disclose their identity when a transaction is called into question (e.g. regulatory or compliance requirements), but without affecting the anonymity and unlinkability of their remaining transactions.",

Also, the machine learning process is difficult to automate. This paper proposes building a trustable machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts are used to automate the machine learning process. This paper makes three contributions. First, it establishes a link between machine learning technology and blockchain technology. Previously, machine learning and blockchain have been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second, it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with blockchain by using a unified approach. The paper uses association rule mining as an example to demonstrate how trustable machine learning can be implemented with blockchain, and it shows how this approach can be used to analyze opioid prescriptions to help combat the opioid crisis.",

In a robotics environment, the old information is useful for human evaluation, or oracles interfacing with the blockchain but it is not useful for the robots that require only current information in order to continue their work. This causes a storage problem in blockchain nodes that have limited storage capacity, such as in the case of nodes attached to robots that are usually built around embedded solutions. This paper presents a time-segmentation solution for devices with limited storage capacity, integrated in a particular robot-directed blockchain called RobotChain. Results are presented regarding the proposed solution that show that the goal of restricting each node's capacity is reached without compromising all the benefits that arise from the use of blockchains in these contexts, and on the contrary, it allows for cheap nodes to use this blockchain, reduces storage costs and allows faster deployment of new nodes.",

Governments across the globe have responded to this promising but nascent technology differently - from being apathetic or adopting a wait-and-watch approach: letting the systems shape themselves, to creating regulatory sandboxes and sponsoring capacity building, or in some instances (arguably) over-regulating and attempting to put the blockchain genie back in the bottle. Possible government role spans across a spectrum: regulating crypto-currencies and initial coin offerings (ICO), formulating regulatory frameworks for managing the adoption of blockchains, particularly in critical infrastructure industries, facilitating capacity building, and finally, embracing blockchain technology in conducting the activities of the government itself - be it internally, or in using them to deliver public services.

Within the architecture, a blockchain-based controller manages identity and access control policies and serves as a tamper-proof log of access events. In addition, off-chain edge nodes store the EHR data and apply policies specified in Abbreviated Language For Authorization (ALFA) to enforce attribute-based access control on EHR data in collaboration with the blockchain-based access control logs.

Governments, financial institutions, banks, industrial supply chains, service companies, and even educational institutions and hospitals are investing in a substantial manner in the hope of improving business efficiency and operational robustness through deployment of blockchain technology. This thesis work is concerned with designing trustworthy business-to-business (B2B) market platforms drawing upon blockchain technology and game theory. The proposed platform is built upon three key ideas. First, we use permissioned blockchains with smart contracts as a technically sound approach for building the B2B platform. The blockchain deploys smart contracts that govern the interactions of enterprise buyers and sellers. Second, the smart contracts are designed using a rigorous analysis of a repeated game model of the strategic interactions between buyers and sellers. We show that such smart contracts induce honest behavior from buyers and sellers.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in the blockchain research have been made in two important directions. One is refined resilience analysis utilizing game theory to study the consequences of selfish behaviors of users (miners), and the other is the extension from a linear (chain) structure to a non-linear (graphical) structure for performance improvements, such as IOTA and Graphcoin. The first question that comes to people's minds is what improvements that a blockchain system would see by leveraging these new advances. In this paper, we consider three major metrics for a blockchain system: full verification, scalability, and finality-duration. We { establish a formal framework and} prove that no blockchain system can achieve full verification, high scalability, and low finality-duration simultaneously. We observe that classical blockchain systems like Bitcoin achieves full verification and low finality-duration, Harmony and Ethereum 2.0 achieve low finality-duration and high scalability. As a complementary, we design a non-linear blockchain system that achieves full verification and scalability. We also establish, for the first time, the trade-off between scalability and finality-duration.",

    "abstract": "Envisioned to be the future of secured distributed systems, blockchain networks have received increasing attention from both the industry and academia in recent years. However, blockchain mining processes demand high hardware costs and consume a vast amount of energy (studies have shown that the amount of energy consumed in Bitcoin mining is almost the same as the electricity used in Ireland). To address the high mining cost problem of blockchain networks, in this paper, we propose a blockchain mining resources allocation algorithm to reduce the mining cost in PoW-based (proof-of-work-based) blockchain networks. We first propose an analytical queueing model for general blockchain networks. In our queueing model, transactions arrive randomly to the queue and are served in a batch manner with unknown service rate probability distribution and agnostic to any priority mechanism. Then, we leverage the Lyapunov optimization techniques to propose a dynamic mining resources allocation algorithm (DMRA), which is parameterized by a tuning parameter $K>0$. We show that our algorithm achieves an $[O(1/K), O(K)]$ cost-optimality-gap-vs-delay tradeoff. Our simulation results also demonstrate the effectiveness of DMRA in reducing mining costs.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has received much attention recently, due to its promises of verifiable, permanent, decentralized, and efficient data handling. In 2017-2019 blockchain and associated technologies such as smart contracts has progressed beyond cryptocurrencies, and has been adopted in banking, retail, healthcare, and other fields. This study critically examines recent applications of blockchain in science, touching upon different stages of research cycle, from data management to publishing, peer review, research evaluation and funding. The paper is based upon a review of blockchain projects, relevant literature, a set of interviews and focus groups with startup founders, scholars, librarians, IT experts from the EU, USA, Russia, and Belarus. Proponents of blockchain for science present this technology as a tool to make science free from bias, red tape, data fraud, as well as provide innovative means to secure financial backing for new ideas. However, these projects face a set of challenges. One issue concerns introducing crypto economy, with its financial incentives, into science, a field that emphasizes disinterested and non-pecuniary pursuit of truth. Another source of concern relates to the ongoing conflict between the principle of decentralization inherent to blockchain and the practice of forcing it from above, by the state and other centralized entities.",

E-government is amongst the systems that stores sensitive information about citizens, businesses and other affiliates, and therefore becomes the target of cyber attackers. The existing e-government systems are centralised and thus subject to single point of failure. This paper proposes a secure and decentralised e-government system based on the consortium blockchain technology, which is a semi-public and decentralised blockchain system consisting of a group of pre-selected entities or organisations in charge of consensus and decisions making for the benefit of the whole network of peers. In addition, a number of e-government nodes are pre-selected to perform the tasks of user and transaction validation before being added to the blockchain network. Accordingly, e-government users of the consortium blockchain network are given the rights to create, submit, access, and review transactions. Performance evaluation on single transaction time and transactions processed per second demonstrate the practicability of the proposed consortium blockchain-based e-government system for secure information sharing amongst all stakeholders.",

The result of these tasks will peg to all other blockchains through the blockchain's terminated branch transferred in a gossip network.

To facilitate this, there have been several survey papers, however, none of them covers the aspect of blockchain-cloud integration from a service-oriented perspective.

In this paper, we first survey the state of the art, focusing on private blockchains (in which parties are authenticated). We analyze both in-production and research systems in four dimensions: distributed ledger, cryptography, consensus protocol and smart contract. We then present BLOCKBENCH, a benchmarking framework for understanding performance of private blockchains against data processing workloads. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of three major blockchain systems based on BLOCKBENCH, namely Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate several trade-offs in the design space, as well as big performance gaps between blockchain and database systems. Drawing from design principles of database systems, we discuss several research directions for bringing blockchain performance closer to the realm of databases.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum execute payment transactions securely, but their performance is limited by the need for global consensus. Payment networks overcome this limitation through off-chain transactions. Instead of writing to the blockchain for each transaction, they only settle the final payment balances with the underlying blockchain. When executing off-chain transactions in current payment networks, parties must access the blockchain within bounded time to detect misbehaving parties that deviate from the protocol. This opens a window for attacks in which a malicious party can steal funds by deliberately delaying other parties' blockchain access and prevents parties from using payment networks when disconnected from the blockchain. We present Teechain, the first layer-two payment network that executes off-chain transactions asynchronously with respect to the underlying blockchain. To prevent parties from misbehaving, Teechain uses treasuries, protected by hardware trusted execution environments (TEEs), to establish off-chain payment channels between parties. Treasuries maintain collateral funds and can exchange transactions efficiently and securely, without interacting with the underlying blockchain. To mitigate against treasury failures and to avoid having to trust all TEEs, Teechain replicates the state of treasuries using committee chains, a new variant of chain replication with threshold secret sharing. Teechain achieves at least a 33x higher transaction throughput than the state-of-the-art Lightning payment network. A 30-machine Teechain deployment can handle over 1 million Bitcoin transactions per second.",

The main advantages of blockchain for its potential use in other domains are its inherent security mechanisms and immunity to different attacks. A blockchain relies on a consensus method for agreeing on any new data. Most of the consensus methods which are currently used for the blockchain of different cryptocurrencies require high computational power and thus are not apt for resource-constrained systems. In this article, we discuss and survey the various blockchain based consensus methods that are applicable to resource constrained IoT devices and networks. A typical IoT network consists of several devices which have limited computational and communications capabilities. Most often, these devices cannot perform intensive computations and are starved for bandwidth. Therefore, we discuss the possible measures that can be taken to reduce the computational power and convergence time for the underlying consensus methods. We also talk about some of the alternatives to the public blockchain like private blockchain and tangle, along with their potential adoption for IoT networks. Furthermore, we review the existing consensus methods that have been implemented and explore the possibility of utilizing them to realize a blockchain based IoT network.

To streamline the diagnosis and treatment process, healthcare professionals are now adopting the wearable technology.

One solution to protect privacy in healthcare is the use of blockchain technology. However, one of the primary problems with blockchain is its highly limited scalability. In this work here, we propose the utilization of a blockchain based protocol to provide secure management and analysis of data. In this paper we use recently introduced PoW based protocol GHOSTDAG, that generalizes Satoshi's blockchain to a direct acyclic graph of blocks (blockDAG) and provides high throughput while also avoiding the security-scalability problem. We use two blockchains based on the original GHOSTDAG protocol, one that is private and one that is public. Using a private blockchain, we create a system where we use smart contracts to analyze patient health data. If the smart contract for any reason issues an alert for an abnormal reading then the system makes the record of that event to the public blockchain. This would resolve the privacy and security vulnerabilities associated with remote patient monitoring and also the limited scalability problem of Satoshi's original blockchain.",

At the micro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and prototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers. The high-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between them and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic, environmental, and governmental. The system level analysis helps us highlight interesting inconsistencies between well-known blockchain applicability decision rules and the approaches taken by the literature.

We review the strategies that some key players in the blockchain ecosystem have implemented, or are proposing to develop, to satisfy this increasing demand for cross-chain communication and transactions between sidechains. Interoperability presents a complex and challenging stumbling block to the wider uptake of blockchain technology.

    "abstract": "Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment system proposed by Nakamoto in 2008. Properties of the bitcoin backbone protocol have been investigated in some depth: the blockchain growth property quantifies the number of blocks added to the blockchain during any time intervals; the blockchain quality property ensures the honest miners always contribute at least a certain fraction of the blockchain; the common prefix property ensures if a block is deep enough, it will eventually be adopted by all honest miners with high probability. Following the spirit of decoupling various functionalities of the blockchain, the Prism protocol is proposed to dramatically improve the throughput while maintaining the same level of security. Prior analyses of the bitcoin and Prism backbone protocols assume the lifespan of blockchain is finite. This paper presents a streamlined and strengthened analysis without the finite horizon assumption. Specifically, the results include a blockchain growth property, a blockchain quality property, and a common prefix property of the bitcoin backbone protocol, as well as the liveness and persistence of the Prism backbone protocol regardless of whether the blockchains have a infinite lifespan. We also express the properties of bitcoin and Prism backbone protocols in explicit expressions rather than order optimal results, which lead to tighter bounds and practical references for public transaction ledger protocol design.",

    "abstract": "The world-changing blockchain technique provides a novel method to establish a secure, trusted and decentralized system for solving the security and personal privacy problems in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. The mining process in blockchain requires miners to solve a proof-of-work puzzle, which requires high computational power. However, the lightweight IIoT devices cannot directly participate in the mining process due to the limitation of power and computational resources. The edge computing service makes it possible for IIoT applications to build a blockchain network, in which IIoT devices purchase computational resources from edge servers and thus can offload their computational tasks. The amount of computational resource purchased by IIoT devices depends on how many profits they can get in the mining process, and will directly affect the security of the blockchain network. In this paper, we investigate the incentive mechanism for the blockchain platform to attract IIoT devices to purchase more computational power from edge servers to participate in the mining process, thereby building a more secure blockchain network. We model the interaction between the blockchain platform and IIoT devices as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the blockchain platform act as the leader, and IIoT devices act as followers. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium, and propose an efficient algorithm to compute the Stackelberg equilibrium point. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm through extensive simulations, and analyze the strategies of blockchain platform and IIoT devices under different situations.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain interoperability is emerging as one of the crucial features of blockchain technology, but the knowledge necessary for achieving it is fragmented. This fact makes it challenging for academics and the industry to seamlessly achieve interoperability among blockchains. Given the novelty and potential of this new domain, we conduct a literature review on blockchain interoperability, by collecting 262 papers, and 70 grey literature documents, constituting a corpus of 332 documents. From those 332 documents, we systematically analyzed and discussed 80 documents, including both peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Our review classifies studies in three categories: Cryptocurrency-directed interoperability approaches, Blockchain Engines, and Blockchain Connectors. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on defined criteria. We discuss not only studies within each category and subcategory but also across categories, providing a holistic overview of blockchain interoperability, paving the way for systematic research in this domain. Our findings show that blockchain interoperability has a much broader spectrum than cryptocurrencies. The present survey leverages an interesting approach: we systematically contacted the authors of grey literature papers and industry solutions to obtain an updated view of their work. Finally, this paper discusses supporting technologies, standards, use cases, open challenges, and provides several future research directions.",

While data can be retained in blockchains, the stored values can be deleted or updated. From a user viewpoint that searches for the data, it is unclear whether the discovered data from the blockchain storage is relevant for real-time decision-making process for blockchain-based application. The data freshness issue serves as a critical factor especially in dynamic networks handling real-time information. In general, transactions to renew the data require additional processing time inside the blockchain network, which is called ledger-commitment latency. Due to this problem, some users may receive outdated data. As a result, it is important to investigate if blockchain is suitable for providing real-time data services. In this article, we first describe blockchain-enabled (BCE) networks with Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Then, we define age of information (AoI) of BCE networks and investigate the influential factors in this AoI. Analysis and experiments are conducted to support our proposed framework. Lastly, we conclude by discussing some future challenges.",

The expansive growth of cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry outlines the need and opportunity for addressing oracle consensus in a manner both technologically and economically efficient as well as futureproof. Blockchain-agnosticism is inherently limited if proposing a technological solution involves adding one more architectural layer. As such, Gravity protocol is designed to be a truly blockchain-agnostic protocol. By ensuring parity through direct integration and by leveraging the stability and security of the respective interconnected ecosystems, Gravity circumvents the need for a dedicated, public blockchain and a native token. Ultimately, Gravity protocol intends to address scalability challenges by providing a solid infrastructure for the creation of gateways, cross-chain applications, and sidechains. This paper introduces and defines the concept of Oracle Consensus and its implementation in the Gravity protocol named the Pulse Consensus algorithm. The proposed consensus architecture allows Gravity to be considered a singular decentralized blockchain-agnostic oracle.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Role-based access control (RBAC) policies represent the rights of subjects in terms of roles to access resources. This research proposes a scalable, flexible and auditable RBAC system using the EOS blockchain platform to meet the security requirements of organizations. The EOS blockchain platform for developing smart contract and decentralized applications (DAPPs) aims to address the scalability problem found in existing blockchain platforms. This smart contract platform aims to eliminate transaction fees while conducting millions of transactions per second. In our proposed approach, the EOS blockchain transparently stores RBAC policies. Administrative roles control access to resources at a higher level according to the way organisations perform operations. An organisation creates roles, role hierarchies and constraints to regulate user actions. Therefore, once an RBAC framework is established, the administrative user (issuer) only needs to grant and revoke roles to support changes in the organisational structure. Our proposed blockchain-based RBAC supports delegation capabilities using gaseless transactions which makes it adoptable and appealing in a large number of application scenarios. Our proposed solution is application-agnostic and well-suited for diverse use cases. Existing state-of-the art security frameworks are not suitable due to the difficulty of scale, higher cost and single point of failure. Consequently, organisations demand a scalable, cost-effective and lightweight access control solution which can better protect their privacy as well. A proof of concept implementation is developed based on the EOS blockchain. Our experimental results and analysis clearly show that our EOS blockchain-based RBAC outperforms existing blockchain platforms in terms of cost, latency, block generation time, contract execution time and throughput.",

    "abstract": "Known for its decentralized and tamper-aware properties, blockchain is attractive to enhance the infrastructure of systems that have been constrained by traditionally centralized and vendor-locked environments. Although blockchain has commonly been used as the operational model behind cryptocurrency, it has far more foreseeable utilities in domains like healthcare, where efficient data flow is highly demanded. Particularly, blockchain and related technologies have been touted as foundational technologies for addressing healthcare interoperability challenges, such as promoting effective communications and securing data exchanges across various healthcare systems. Despite the increasing interests in leveraging blockchain technology to improve healthcare infrastructures, a major gap in literature is the lack of available recommendations for concrete architectural styles and design considerations for creating blockchain-based apps and systems with a healthcare focus. This research provides two contributions to bridge the gap in existing research. First, we introduce a pattern sequence for designing blockchain-based healthcare systems focused on secure and at-scale data exchange. Our approach adapts traditional software patterns and proposes novel patterns that take into account both the technical requirements specific to healthcare systems and the implications of these requirements on naive blockchain-based solutions. Second, we provide a pattern-oriented reference architecture using an example application of the pattern sequence for guiding software developers to design interoperable (on the technical level) healthcare IT systems atop blockchain-based infrastructures. The reference architecture focuses on minimizing storage requirements on-chain, preserving the privacy of sensitive information, facilitating scalable communications, and maximizing evolvability of the system.",

This paper focuses on using Blockchain to provide a robust and secure decentralized computing system. The paper conducts a literature review on Blockchain-based methods capable for the decentralization of the future Internet. To achieve that decentralization, two research aspects of Blockchain have been investigated that are highly relevant in realizing the decentralized Internet. The first aspect is the consensus algorithms, which are vital components for decentralization of Blockchain. We have identified three consensus algorithms being PoP, Paxos, and PoAH to be more adequate for reaching consensus in Blockchain-enabled Internet architecture. The second aspect that we investigated is the impact of future Internet technologies on Blockchain, where their combinations with Blockchain would help to make it overcome its established flaws and be more optimized and applicable for Internet decentralization.",

    "abstract": "Owing to some special characteristics and features, blockchain is a very useful technique that can securely organize diverse devices in a smart city. It finds wide applications, especially in distributed environments, where entities such as wireless sensors need to be certain of the authenticity of the server. As contemporary blockchain techniques that address post-quantum concerns have not been designed, in this study, we investigate a blockchain in the post-quantum setting and seek to discover how it can resist attacks from quantum computing. In addition, traditional proof of work (PoW)-based consensus protocols such as Bitcoin cannot supply memory mining, and the transaction capacity of each block in a blockchain is limited and needs to be expanded. Thus, a new post-quantum proof of work (post-quantum PoW) consensus algorithm for security and privacy of smart city applications is proposed. It can be used to not only protect a blockchain under a quantum computing attack compared to existing classical hash-based PoW algorithms but also to supply memory mining. Meanwhile, an identity-based post-quantum signature is embedded into a transaction process to construct lightweight transactions. Subsequently, we provide a detailed description on the execution of the post-quantum lightweight transaction in a blockchain. Overall, this work can help enrich the research on future post-quantum blockchain and support the construction or architecture of emerging blockchain-based smart cities.",

By providing a basis for consensus, blockchain promises to upend business models that presuppose a central authority. However, blockchain suffers from major shortcomings arising from an over-regimented way of organizing computation that limits its prospects. We propose a sociotechnical, yet computational, perspective that avoids those shortcomings. A centerpiece of our vision is the notion of a declarative, violable contract in contradistinction to smart contracts. This new way of thinking enables flexible governance, by formalizing organizational structures; verification of correctness without obstructing autonomy; and a meaningful basis for trust.",

It must motivate users to maintain the system while preventing a minority of these users from colluding and gaining disproportionate control.

Mining rewards cause centralization in \"proof of work\" chains such as Bitcoin. Validator rewards and punishments invite attacks in \"proof of stake\" chains. This paper argues why these incentive schemes are detrimental to blockchain. It considers a range of other systems---some of which incorporate monetary incentives, some of which do not---to confirm that monetary incentives are neither necessary nor sufficient for good user behavior.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain Sharding is a blockchain performance enhancement approach. By splitting a blockchain into several parallel-run committees (shards), it helps increase transaction throughput, reduce resources required, and increase reward expectation for participants. Recently, several flexible sharding methods that can tolerate up to $n/2$ Byzantine nodes ($n/2$ security level) have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from two main drawbacks. First, in a non-sharding blockchain, nodes can have different weight (power or stake) to create a consensus. So an adversary needs to control half of the overall weight of the system in order for a piece of faulty information to be accepted into the blockchain ($p/2$ security level). In blockchain sharding, all nodes carry the same weight. Thus, it is only under the assumption that the honest participants are creating as many nodes as they can that a $n/2$ security level blockchain sharding reaches the $p/2$ security level. Secondly, when some nodes leave the system, other nodes need to be reassigned, frequently, from shard to shard in order to maintain the security level of the system. In this paper, we present Multichain MWPoW, a $p/2$ security level blockchain sharding architecture that does not require honest participants to create multiple nodes and requires less node reassignment when some nodes leave the system. It combines the Multiple Winners Proof of Work consensus protocol (MWPoW) with the flexibility of $n/2$ blockchain sharding. Our experiments show that Multichain MWPoW outperforms existing blockchain sharding approaches in terms of security, transaction throughput and flexibility.",

    "abstract": "During the normal operation of a Cloud solution, no one pays attention to the logs except the system reliability engineers, who may periodically check them to ensure that the Cloud platform's performance conforms to the Service Level Agreements (SLA). However, the moment a component fails, or a customer complains about a breach of SLA, the importance of logs increases significantly. All departments, including management, customer support, and even the actual customer, may turn to logs to determine the cause and timeline of the issue and to find the party responsible for the issue. The party at fault may be motivated to tamper with the logs to hide their role. Given the number and volume of logs generated by the Cloud platforms, many tampering opportunities exist. We argue that the critical nature of logs calls for immutability and verification mechanism without the presence of a single trusted party. This paper proposes such a mechanism by describing a blockchain-based log system, called Logchain, which can be integrated with existing private and public blockchain solutions. Logchain uses the immutability feature of blockchain to provide a tamper-resistance storage platform for log storage. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical structure to combine the hash-binding of two blockchains to address blockchains' scalability issues. To validate the mechanism, we integrate Logchain into two different types of blockchains. We choose Ethereum as a public, permission-less blockchain and IBM Blockchain as a private, permission-based one. We show that the solution is scalable on both the private and public blockchains. Additionally, we perform the analysis of the cost of ownership for private and public blockchains implementations to help a reader selecting an implementation that would be applicable to their needs.",

Various systems, like the Web PKI (X.509) and PGP's Web of Trust are used to manage trust in this setting. In recent years, blockchain technology has been introduced as a panacea to our security problems, including that of authentication, without sufficient reasoning, as to its merits.In this work, we investigate the merits of using open distributed ledgers (ODLs), such as the one implemented by blockchain technology, for securing TM systems for authentication. We formally model such systems, and explore how blockchain can help mitigate attacks against them. After formal argumentation, we conclude that in the context of Trust Management for authentication, blockchain technology, and ODLs in general, can offer considerable advantages compared to previous approaches. Our analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to formally model and argue about the security of TM systems for authentication, based on blockchain technology. To achieve this result, we first provide an abstract model for TM systems for authentication. Then, we show how this model can be conceptually encoded in a blockchain, by expressing it as a series of state transitions. As a next step, we examine five prevalent attacks on TM systems, and provide evidence that blockchain-based solutions can be beneficial to the security of such systems, by mitigating, or completely negating such attacks.",

    "abstract": "From its early days the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved into a decentralized system of cooperating smart objects with the requirement, among others, of achieving distributed consensus. Yet, current IoT platform solutions are centralized cloud based computing infrastructures, manifesting a number of significant disadvantages, such as, among others, high cloud server maintenance costs, weakness for supporting time-critical IoT applications, security and trust issues. Enabling blockchain technology into IoT can help to achieve a proper distributed consensus based IoT system that overcomes those disadvantages. While this is an ideal match, it is still a challenging endeavor. In this paper we take a first step towards that goal by designing Hybrid-IoT, a hybrid blockchain architecture for IoT. In Hybrid-IoT, subgroups of IoT devices form PoW blockchains, referred to as PoW sub-blockchains. Then, the connection among the PoW sub-blockchains employs a BFT inter-connector framework, such as Polkadot or Cosmos. In this paper we focus on the PoW sub-blockchains formation, guided by a set of guidelines based on a set of dimensions, metrics and bounds. In order to prove the validity of the approach we carry a performance and security evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are applications that execute on blockchains. Today they manage billions of dollars in value and motivate visionary plans for pervasive blockchain deployment. While smart contracts inherit the availability and other security assurances of blockchains, however, they are impeded by blockchains' lack of confidentiality and poor performance. We present Ekiden, a system that addresses these critical gaps by combining blockchains with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Ekiden leverages a novel architecture that separates consensus from execution, enabling efficient TEE-backed confidentiality-preserving smart-contracts and high scalability. Our prototype (with Tendermint as the consensus layer) achieves example performance of 600x more throughput and 400x less latency at 1000x less cost than the Ethereum mainnet. Another contribution of this paper is that we systematically identify and treat the pitfalls arising from harmonizing TEEs and blockchains. Treated separately, both TEEs and blockchains provide powerful guarantees, but hybridized, though, they engender new attacks. For example, in naive designs, privacy in TEE-backed contracts can be jeopardized by forgery of blocks, a seemingly unrelated attack vector. We believe the insights learned from Ekiden will prove to be of broad importance in hybridized TEE-blockchain systems.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has many benefits including decentralization, availability, persistency, consistency, anonymity, auditability and accountability, and it also covers a wide spectrum of applications ranging from cryptocurrency, financial services, reputation system, Internet of Things, sharing economy to public and social services. Not only may blockchain be regarded as a by-product of Bitcoin cryptocurrency systems, but also it is a type of distributed ledger technology through using a trustworthy, decentralized log of totally ordered transactions. By summarizing the literature of blockchain, it is found that more papers focus on engineering implementation and realization, while little work has been done on basic theory, for example, mathematical models (Markov processes, queueing theory and game models), performance analysis and optimization of blockchain systems. In this paper, we develop queueing theory of blockchain systems and provide system performance evaluation. To do this, we design a Markovian batch-service queueing system with two different service stages, while the two stages are suitable to well express the mining process in the miners pool and the building of a new blockchain. By using the matrix-geometric solution, we obtain a system stable condition and express three key performance measures: (a) The number of transactions in the queue, (b) the number of transactions in a block, and (c) the transaction-confirmation time. Finally, We use numerical examples to verify computability of our theoretical results. Although our queueing model is simple under exponential or Poisson assumptions, our analytic method will open a series of potentially promising research in queueing theory of blockchain systems.",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies and their foundation technology, the Blockchain, are reshaping finance and economics, allowing a decentralized approach enabling trusted applications with no trusted counterpart. More recently, the Blockchain and the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more and more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications. Some people have come to the point of saying that the \"Blockchain revolution\" can be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a result, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried software development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis which does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of software engineering are taken into account. This paper tries to cope with this issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement, analyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process is based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and incremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more formal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the system, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain development. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to show how it works.",

    "abstract": "Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009 we have seen a great push towards public and private blockchains. In order to avoid fragmentation, a global network connecting all these blockchains is envisioned. Just like the Internet facilitates communication and the transfer of information, we propose a system, similar in size and reach for payments and transactions: A cryptographically-secure off-chain multi-asset instant transaction network (COMIT) can connect and exchange any asset on any blockchain to any other blockchain using a cross-chain routing protocol (CRP). COMIT is a super blockchain network that allows for instant transactions which are enforced using off-chain smart contracts. It leverages Payment Channels and Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLC) across chains to solve the problem of double spending attacks without requiring a settlement onto the underlying blockchains. COMIT's connectivity is provided by Liquidity Providers (LP), who operate on one or more blockchains, acting as payment hubs and nodes on a single chain and market makers in a decentralized network for cross-chain asset conversions. This paper lays out how COMIT works, the benefits for Users, Liquidity Providers and Businesses; and how this does not only accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology, but furthermore allows for an integration with the traditional banking system.",

    "abstract": "With the development of decentralized consensus protocols, permissionless blockchains have been envisioned as a promising enabler for the general-purpose transaction-driven, autonomous systems. However, most of the prevalent blockchain networks are built upon the consensus protocols under the crypto-puzzle framework known as proof-of-work. Such protocols face the inherent problem of transaction-processing bottleneck, as the networks achieve the decentralized consensus for transaction confirmation at the cost of very high latency. In this paper, we study the problem of consensus formation in a system of multiple throughput-scalable blockchains with sharded consensus. Specifically, the protocol design of sharded consensus not only enables parallelizing the process of transaction validation with sub-groups of processors, but also introduces the Byzantine consensus protocols for accelerating the consensus processes. By allowing different blockchains to impose different levels of processing fees and to have different transaction-generating rate, we aim to simulate the multi-service provision eco-systems based on blockchains in real world. We focus on the dynamics of blockchain-selection in the condition of a large population of consensus processors. Hence, we model the evolution of blockchain selection by the individual processors as an evolutionary game. Both the theoretical and the numerical analysis are provided regarding the evolutionary equilibria and the stability of the processors' strategies in a general case.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a disruptive technology intended at implementing secure decentralized distributed systems, in which transactional data can be shared, stored and verified by participants of a system using cryptographic and consensus mechanisms, elevating the need for a central authentication/verification authority. Contrary to the belief, blockchain-based systems are not inherently secure by design; it is crucial for security software engineers to be aware of the various blockchain specific architectural design decisions and choices and their consequences on the dependability of the software system. We argue that sub-optimal and ill-informed design decisions and choices of blockchain components and their configurations including smart contracts, key management, cryptographic and consensus mechanisms, on-chain vs. off chain storage choices can introduce security technical debt into the system. The technical debt metaphor can serve as a powerful tool for early, preventive and transparent evaluation of the security design of blockchain-based systems by making the potential security technical debt visible to security software engineers. We review the core architectural components of blockchain-based systems and we show how the ill-choice or sub-optimal design decisions and configuration of these components can manifest into security technical debt. We contribute to a taxonomy that classifies the blockchain specific design decisions and choices and we describe their connection to potential debts. The taxonomy can help architects of this category of systems avoid potential security risks by visualising the security technical debts and raising its visibility. We use examples from two case studies to discuss the taxonomy and its application.",

Among various core components, consensus protocol is the defining technology behind the security and performance of blockchain. From incremental modifications of Nakamoto consensus protocol to innovative alternative consensus mechanisms, many consensus protocols have been proposed to improve the performance of the blockchain network itself or to accommodate other specific application needs. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols. To facilitate the discussion of our analysis, we first introduce the key definitions and relevant results in the classic theory of fault tolerance which help to lay the foundation for further discussion. We identify five core components of a blockchain consensus protocol, namely, block proposal, block validation, information propagation, block finalization, and incentive mechanism. A wide spectrum of blockchain consensus protocols are then carefully reviewed accompanied by algorithmic abstractions and vulnerability analyses. The surveyed consensus protocols are analyzed using the five-component framework and compared with respect to different performance metrics. These analyses and comparisons provide us new insights in the fundamental differences of various proposals in terms of their suitable application scenarios, key assumptions, expected fault tolerance, scalability, drawbacks and trade-offs. We believe this survey will provide blockchain developers and researchers a comprehensive view on the state-of-the-art consensus protocols and facilitate the process of designing future protocols.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) bears unprecedented security and scalability challenges due to the magnitude of data produced and exchanged by IoT devices and platforms. Some of those challenges are currently being addressed by coupling IoT applications with blockchains. However, current blockchain-backed IoT systems simply use the blockchain to store access control policies, thereby underutilizing the power of blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Sash that couples IoT platforms with blockchain that provides a number of advantages compared to state of the art. In Sash, the blockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control decisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are correctly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a ``data marketplace'' by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle financial transaction and providing ``by design'' remuneration to data producers. Finally, we exploit a special flavor of identity-based encryption to cater for cryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to distribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source IoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end. We also evaluate the performance of our prototype and show that it incurs tolerable overhead in realistic deployment settings.",

As blockchain evolves into another data management system, the natural question is how it compares against distributed database systems. Existing works on this comparison focus on high-level properties, such as security and throughput. They stop short of showing how the underlying design choices contribute to the overall differences. Our work fills this important gap and provides a principled framework for analyzing the emerging trend of blockchain-database fusion. We perform a twin study of blockchains and distributed database systems as two types of transactional systems. We propose a taxonomy that illustrates the dichotomy across four dimensions, namely replication, concurrency, storage, and sharding. Within each dimension, we discuss how the design choices are driven by two goals: security for blockchains, and performance for distributed databases. To expose the impact of different design choices on the overall performance, we conduct an in-depth performance analysis of two blockchains, namely Quorum and Hyperledger Fabric, and two distributed databases, namely TiDB, and etcd. Lastly, we propose a framework for back-of-the-envelope performance forecast of blockchain-database hybrids.",

However, despite their increasing popularity and adoption, there is a lack of standardized models that study blockchain-related security threats. To fill this gap, the main focus of our work is to systematize and extend the knowledge about the security and privacy aspects of blockchains and contribute to the standardization of this domain. We propose the security reference architecture (SRA) for blockchains, which adopts a stacked model (similar to the ISO/OSI) describing the nature and hierarchy of various security and privacy aspects. The SRA contains four layers: (1) the network layer, (2) the consensus layer, (3) the replicated state machine layer, and (4) the application layer. At each of these layers, we identify known security threats, their origin, and countermeasures, while we also analyze several cross-layer dependencies. Next, to enable better reasoning about security aspects of blockchains by the practitioners, we propose a blockchain-specific version of the threat-risk assessment standard ISO/IEC 15408 by embedding the stacked model into this standard. Finally, we provide designers of blockchain platforms and applications with a design methodology following the model of SRA and its hierarchy.",

However, initial blockchain applications (like Bitcoin) attain very low throughput, which has promoted the design of permissioned blockchain systems. These permissioned blockchain systems employ classical Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols to reach consensus. However, existing permissioned blockchain systems still attain low throughputs (of the order 10K txns/s). As a result, existing works blame this low throughput on the associated BFT protocol and expend resources in developing optimized protocols. We believe such blames only depict a one-sided story. In specific, we raise a simple question: can a well-crafted system based on a classical BFT protocol outperform a modern protocol? We show that designing such a well-crafted system is possible and illustrate that even if such a system employs a three-phase protocol, it can outperform another system utilizing a single-phase protocol. This endeavor requires us to dissect a permissioned blockchain system and highlight different factors that affect its performance. Based on our insights, we present the design of our enterprise-grade, high-throughput yielding permissioned blockchain system, ResilientDB, that employs multi-threaded deep pipelines, to balance tasks at a replica, and provides guidelines for future designs.",

The centralized cloud-based IoT service architecture has serious limitations in terms of security, availability, and scalability, and is subject to single points of failure (SPOF).

However, blockchain's shortcomings of high cost, low throughput, and long latency make it unsuitable for IoT applications. In this paper, we take a retrospection of existing blockchain-based IoT solutions and propose a framework for efficient blockchain and IoT integration. Following the framework, we design a novel blockchain-assisted decentralized IoT remote accessing system, RS-IoT, which has the advantage of defending IoT devices against zero-day attacks without relying on any trusted third-party. By introducing incentives and penalties enforced by smart contracts, our work enables \"an economic approach\" to thwarting the majority of attackers who aim to achieve monetary gains. Our work presents an example of how blockchain can be used to ensure the fairness of service trading in a decentralized environment and punish misbehaviors objectively. We show the security of RS-IoT via detailed security analyses.

    "abstract": "Recently, blockchain has gained momentum in the academic community thanks to its decentralization, immutability, transparency and security. As an emerging paradigm, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has been widely used to provide computation and storage resources to mobile user equipments (UE) at the edge of the network for improving the performance of mobile applications. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based MEC architecture where UEs can offload their computation tasks to the MEC servers. In particular, a blockchain network is deployed and hosted on the MEC platform as Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) that supports smart contract-based resource trading and transaction mining services for mobile task offloading. To enhance the performance of the blockchain-empowered MEC system, we propose a joint scheme of computation offloading and blockchain mining. Accordingly, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize edge service revenue and blockchain mining reward while minimizing the service computation latency with respect to constraints of user service demands and hash power resource. We then propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach using a double deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm to solve the proposed problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the other baseline methods in terms of better system utility with computational efficiency. Experiment results also verify that the trading contract design is efficient with low operation cost, showing the feasibility of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has emerged as a decentralized and distributed framework that enables tamper-resilience and, thus, practical immutability for stored data. This immutability property is important in scenarios where auditability is desired, such as in maintaining access logs for sensitive healthcare and biomedical data.However, the underlying data structure of blockchain, by default, does not provide capabilities to efficiently query the stored data. In this investigation, we show that it is possible to efficiently run complex audit queries over the access log data stored on blockchains by using additional key-value stores. This paper specifically reports on the approach we designed for the blockchain track of iDASH Privacy & Security Workshop 2018 competition.Particularly, we implemented our solution and compared its loading and query-response performance with SQLite, a commonly used relational database, using the data provided by the iDASH 2018 organizers. Depending on the query type and the data size, the run time difference between blockchain based query-response and SQLite based query-response ranged from 0.2 seconds to 6 seconds. A deeper inspection revealed that range queries were the bottleneck of our solution which, nevertheless, scales up linearly. Concretely, this investigation demonstrates that blockchain-based systems can provide reasonable query-response times to complex queries even if they only use simple key-value stores to manage their data. Consequently, we show that blockchains may be useful for maintaining data with auditability and immutability requirements across multiple sites.",

    "abstract": "Decentralization is a key indicator for the evaluation of public blockchains. In the past, there have been very few studies on measuring and comparing the actual level of decentralization between Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains and blockchains with other consensus protocols. This paper presents a new comparison study of the level of decentralization in Bitcoin and Steem, a prominent Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchain. Our study particularly focuses on analysing the power that decides the creators of blocks in the blockchain. In Bitcoin, miners with higher computational power generate more blocks. In contrast, blocks in Steem are equally generated by witnesses while witnesses are periodically elected by stakeholders with different voting power weighted by invested stake. We analyze the process of stake-weighted election of witnesses in DPoS and measure the actual stake invested by each stakeholder in Steem. We then compute the Shannon entropy of the distribution of computational power among miners in Bitcoin and the distribution of invested stake among stakeholders in Steem. Our analyses reveal that neither Bitcoin nor Steem is dominantly better than the other with respect to decentralization. Compared with Steem, Bitcoin tends to be more decentralized among top miners but less decentralized in general. Our study is designed to provide insights into the current state of the degree of decentralization in DPoS and PoW blockchains. We believe that the methodologies and findings in this paper can facilitate future studies of decentralization in other blockchain systems employing different consensus protocols.",

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art techniques for processing cross-blockchain transactions take a simple centralized approach: when the assets on blockchain $X$, say $X$-coins, are exchanged with the assets on blockchain $Y$---the $Y$-coins, those $X$-coins need to be exchanged to a \"middle\" medium (such as Bitcoin) that is then exchanged to $Y$-coins. If there are more than two parties involved in a single global transaction, the global transaction is split into multiple local two-party transactions, each of which follows the above central-exchange protocol. Unfortunately, the atomicity of the global transaction is violated with the central-exchange approach: those local two-party transactions, once committed, cannot be rolled back if the global transaction decides to abort. In a more general sense, the graph-based model of (two-party) transactions can hardly be extended to an arbitrary number of parties in a cross-blockchain transaction. %from why to how In this paper, we introduce a higher-level abstraction of cross-blockchain transactions. We adopt the \\textit{abstract simplicial complex}, an extensively-studied mathematical object in algebraic topology, to represent an arbitrary number of parties involved in the blockchain transactions. Essentially, each party in the global transaction is modeled as a vertex and the global transaction among $n+1$ ($n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $n > 0$) parties compose a $n$-dimensional simplex. While this higher-level abstraction seems plausibly trivial, we will show how this simple extension leads to a new line of modeling methods and protocols for better processing cross-blockchain transactions.",

However, there are critical issues to be addressed before its widespread deployment, such as transaction efficiency, bandwidth bottleneck, and security. Techniques are being explored to tackle these issues. Stochastic modeling, as one of these techniques, has been applied to analyze a variety of blockchain characteristics, but there is a lack of a comprehensive survey on it. In this survey, we aim to fill the gap and review the stochastic models proposed to address common issues in blockchain. Firstly, this paper provides the basic knowledge of blockchain technology and stochastic models. Then, according to different objects, the stochastic models for blockchain analysis are divided into network-oriented and application-oriented (mainly refer to cryptocurrency). The network-oriented stochastic models are further classified into two categories, namely, performance and security. About the application-oriented stochastic models, the widest adoption mainly concentrates on the price prediction of cryptocurrency. Moreover, we provide analysis and comparison in detail on every taxonomy and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the related works to serve guides for further researches. Finally, challenges and future research directions are given to apply stochastic modeling approaches to study blockchain. By analyzing and classifying the existing researches, we hope that our survey can provide suggestions for the researchers who are interested in blockchain and good at using stochastic models as a tool to address problems.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology has evolved through many changes and modifications, such as smart-contracts since its inception in 2008. The popularity of a blockchain system is due to the fact that it offers a significant security advantage over other traditional systems. However, there have been many attacks in various blockchain systems, exploiting different vulnerabilities and bugs, which caused a significant financial loss. Therefore, it is essential to understand how these attacks in blockchain occur, which vulnerabilities they exploit, and what threats they expose. Another concerning issue in this domain is the recent advancement in the quantum computing field, which imposes a significant threat to the security aspects of many existing secure systems, including blockchain, as they would invalidate many widely-used cryptographic algorithms. Thus, it is important to examine how quantum computing will affect these or other new attacks in the future. In this paper, we explore different vulnerabilities in current blockchain systems and analyse the threats that various theoretical and practical attacks in the blockchain expose. We then model those attacks using Petri nets concerning current systems and future quantum computers.",

Specifically, a process model comprising tasks performed by multiple parties can be coordinated via smart contracts operating on the blockchain. The consensus mechanism governing the blockchain thereby guarantees that the process model is followed by each party. However, the cost required for blockchain use is highly dependent on the volume of data recorded and the frequency of data updates by smart contracts. This paper proposes an optimized method for executing business processes on top of commodity blockchain technology. The paper presents a method for compiling a process model into a smart contract that encodes the preconditions for executing each task in the process using a space-optimized data structure. The method is empirically compared to a previously proposed baseline by replaying execution logs, including one from a real-life business process, and measuring resource consumption.",

Companies are exploring implementation of use cases in hope of significant gains in efficiencies. However, to achieve the impact hoped for, it is not sufficient to merely replace existing technologies. The current business processes must also be redesigned and innovated to enable realization of hoped for benefits. This conceptual paper provides a theoretical contribution on how blockchain technology and smart contracts potentially can, within the framework of the seven principles of business process re-engineering (BPR), enable process innovations. In this paper, we analyze the BPR principles in light of their applicability to blockchain-based solutions. We find these principles to be applicable and helpful in understanding how blockchain technology could enable transformational redesign of current processes. However, the viewpoint taken, should be expanded from intra- to inter-organizational processes operating within an ecosystem of separate organizational entities. In such a blockchain powered ecosystem, smart contracts take on a pivotal role, both as repositories of data and executioner of activities.",

Recent adoption of Internet of Things and Blockchain technologies give promise at better supply chain provenance. We are particularly interested in the blockchain as many favoured use cases of blockchain are for provenance tracking. We are also interested in applying ontologies as there has been some work done on knowledge provenance, traceability, and food provenance using ontologies. In this paper, we make a case for why ontologies can contribute to blockchain design. To support this case, we analyze a traceability ontology and translate some of its representations to smart contracts that execute a provenance trace and enforce traceability constraints on the Ethereum blockchain platform.",

    "abstract": "A blockchain is a decentralized ledger where all transactions are recorded. For having a reliable blockchain and double-spending prevention, we need a decentralized consensus and agreement on a blockchain. Bitcoin uses proof-of-work (PoW). It is a cryptographic puzzle that is difficult to solve but easy to verify. However, because of significant latency of proof-of-work for transactions confirmation, this consensus mechanism is vulnerable against double-spending. On the other hand, PoW consumes a significant amount of energy that by growing the network, it becomes a major problematic of this consensus mechanism. In this paper, we introduce an alternative to PoW, because of all its major problems and security issues that may lead to collapsing decentralization of the blockchain, while a full decentralized system is the main purpose of using blockchain technology. The approach we introduce is based on a distributed voting process and called \"RDV: Register, Deposit, Vote\". Since in RDV algorithm, there is no mining process, so it is appropriate for low-level energy devices and Internet of Things (IoT).",

We show that marginal innovation and sophistication of the smart contract have non-monotonic effects on the trading value in the blockchain platform, its fundamental value, the price of cryptocurrency, and consumers' welfare. Moreover, a blockchain manager who controls the level of the innovation of the smart contract has an incentive to keep it lower than the first best when the underlying information asymmetry is not severe, leading to welfare loss for consumers.",

Information on most blockchains can be viewed by every node hosting the blockchain, which means that most blockchains cannot handle private data. Decentralized databases exist that guarantee privacy by encrypting user data with the user's private key, but this prevents easy data sharing. However, in many real world applications, from student data to medical records, it is desirable that user data is anonymously searchable. In this paper we present a novel system that gives users ownership over their data while at the same time enabling them to make their data searchable within previously agreed upon limits. Our system implements a strong notion of ownership using a self-sovereign identity system and a weak notion of ownership using multiple centralized databases together with a blockchain and a tumbling process. We discuss applications of our methods to university's student records and medical data.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains is a special type of distributed systems that operates in unsafe networks. In most blockchains, all nodes should reach consensus on all state transitions with Byzantine fault tolerant algorithms, which creates bottlenecks in performance. In this paper, we propose a new type of blockchains, namely Value-Centric Blockchains (VCBs), in which the states are specified as values (or more comprehensively, coins) with owners and the state transition records are then specified as proofs of the ownerships of individual values. We then formalize the \"rational\" assumptions that have been used in most blockchains. We further propose a VCB, VAPOR, that guarantees secure value transfers if all nodes are rational and keep the proofs of the values they owned, which is merely parts of the whole state transition record. As a result, we show that VAPOR enjoys significant benefits in throughput, decentralization, and flexibility without compromising security.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains have shown great promise as peer-to-peer digital currency systems over the past 10 years. However, with increased popularity, the demand for processing transactions has also grown leading to increased costs, confirmation times, and limited blockchain utility. There have been a number of proposals on how to scale blockchains, such as Plasma, Polkadot, Elastico, RapidChain, Bitcoin-NG, and OmniLedger. These solutions all propose the segmentation of every function of a blockchain, namely consensus, permanent data storage, transaction processing, and consistency, which significantly increases the complexity and difficulty of implementation. BlockReduce is a new blockchain structure which only segments consistency, allowing it to scale to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second without impacting fault tolerance or decentralization. Moreover, BlockReduce will significantly decrease node bandwidth requirements and network latency through incentives while simultaneously minimizing other resource demands in order to prevent centralization of nodes.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains have recently been under the spotlight due to the boom of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. There is an increasing demand for querying the data stored in a blockchain database. To ensure query integrity, the user can maintain the entire blockchain database and query the data locally. However, this approach is not economic, if not infeasible, because of the blockchain's huge data size and considerable maintenance costs. In this paper, we take the first step toward investigating the problem of verifiable query processing over blockchain databases. We propose a novel framework, called vChain, that alleviates the storage and computing costs of the user and employs verifiable queries to guarantee the results' integrity. To support verifiable Boolean range queries, we propose an accumulator-based authenticated data structure that enables dynamic aggregation over arbitrary query attributes. Two new indexes are further developed to aggregate intra-block and inter-block data records for efficient query verification. We also propose an inverted prefix tree structure to accelerate the processing of a large number of subscription queries simultaneously. Security analysis and empirical study validate the robustness and practicality of the proposed techniques.",

To mention a few: healthcare data is fragmented across several silos negatively affecting research and services, about half of the clinical trials are never reported, the cost of drug discovery is ever increasing, and substandard and fake medicines are still a huge problem. Blockchain has the potential to solve these problems as it provides trust without any intermediaries, has traceability as a default feature, and promises new business models by enabling novel incentive structures. Due to its potential, blockchain has gathered significant interest in the healthcare industry. In this paper, we review major use cases of blockchain in healthcare: patient data management, pharmaceutical research, supply chain management of medical goods, prescription management, billing claims management, analytics, and telemedicine alongside the related projects. We found that most of the blockchain projects are limited as white-papers, proof of concepts, and products with a limited user base. However, we observed that the quantity, quality, and maturity of the projects are increasing. We also discuss technical, regulatory, and business challenges to the adoption of blockchain in the healthcare industry",

    "abstract": "Thanks to rapid technological advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), a smart public safety (SPS) system has become feasible by integrating heterogeneous computing devices to collaboratively provide public protection services. While a service oriented architecture (SOA) has been adopted by IoT and cyber-physical systems (CPS), it is difficult for a monolithic architecture to provide scalable and extensible services for a distributed IoT based SPS system. Furthermore, traditional security solutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be a performance bottleneck or single point failure. Inspired by microservices architecture and blockchain technology, this paper proposes a BLockchain-ENabled Decentralized Microservices Architecture for Smart public safety (BlendMAS). Within a permissioned blockchain network, a microservices based security mechanism is introduced to secure data access control in an SPS system. The functionality of security services are decoupled into separate containerized microservices that are built using a smart contract, and deployed on edge and fog computing nodes. An extensive experimental study verified that the proposed BlendMAS is able to offer a decentralized, scalable and secured data sharing and access control to distributed IoT based SPS system.",

We first discuss opportunities and challenges in the integration of blockchain and biometrics, with emphasis in biometric template storage and protection, a key problem in biometrics still largely unsolved. Blockchain technologies provide excellent architectures and practical tools for securing and managing the sensitive and private data stored in biometric templates, but at a cost. We explore experimentally the key tradeoffs involved in that integration, namely: latency, processing time, economic cost, and biometric performance. We experimentally study those factors by implementing a smart contract on Ethereum for biometric template storage, whose cost-performance is evaluated by varying the complexity of state-of-the-art schemes for face and handwritten signature biometrics. We report our experiments using popular benchmarks in biometrics research, including deep learning approaches and databases captured in the wild. As a result, we experimentally show that straightforward schemes for data storage in blockchain (i.e., direct and hash-based) may be prohibitive for biometric template storage using state-of-the-art biometric methods. A good cost-performance tradeoff is shown by using a blockchain approach based on Merkle trees.",

Blockchains provide an immutable record of transactions, making them useful when business actors do not trust each other. Their distributed nature makes them suitable for inter-organizational applications. However, proof-of-work based blockchains are computationally inefficient and do not provide final consensus, although they scale well to large networks. In contrast, blockchains built around Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithms are more efficient and provide immediate and final consensus, but do not scale well to large networks. We argue that this makes them well-suited for workflow management applications that typically include no more than a few dozen participants but require final consensus.

Existing efforts to survey the area reveal a fragmented terminology and the lack of a unified framework to reason about the properties of blockchain protocols. In this paper, we work towards bridging this gap. We present a five-dimensional design space with a modular structure in which protocols can be compared and understood. Based on these five axes -- Optimality, Stability, Efficiency, Robustness and Persistence -- we organize the properties of existing protocols in subcategories of increasing granularity. The result is a dynamic scheme -- termed the PREStO framework -- which aids the interaction between stakeholders of different backgrounds, including managers and investors, and which enables systematic reasoning about blockchain protocols. We illustrate its value by comparing existing protocols and identifying research challenges, hence making a first step towards understanding the blockchain ecosystem through a more comprehensive lens.",

There are over 1 billion Ethereum transactions to date. Smart contracts that are transparent about their function are more successful than opaque contracts. We have therefore developed a tool (ContractVis) to explore the transparency of smart contracts. The tool generates a replay script for the historic transactions of a smart contract. The script executes the transactions with the same arguments as recorded on the blockchain, but in a minimal test environment. Running a replay script provides insights into the contract, and insights into the blockchain explorer that was used to retrieve the contract and its history. We provide five concrete recommendations for blockchain explorers like Etherscan to improve the transparency of smart contracts.",

RAINBLOCK achieves this by tackling the I/O bottleneck on two fronts: first, decoupling transaction processing from I/O, and removing I/O from the critical path; second, reducing I/O amplification by customizing storage for blockchains. RAINBLOCK uses a novel variant of the Merkle tree, the Distributed Sharded Merkle tree (DSM-TREE) to store system state. We evaluate RAINBLOCK using workloads based on public Ethereum traces (including smart contracts) and show that RAINBLOCK processes 20K transactions per second in a geo-distributed setting with four regions spread across three continents.",

    "abstract": "Electronic systems tend to simplify the tedious traditional scheme and basically focuses on the platform design and process organization. The integrity of the output of an automated system is not left behind but the possibility of internal manipulation is still high. This paper presents the current issues in company procurements and the solution in the form of blockchain technology. Several individuals and professionals were asked to evaluate a blockchain-based procurement system in comparison to the current electronic (e-procurement) system. A blockchain-based system has the capability to hold transactional data with complete decentralization and eliminate the growing number of fraud cases in companies and organizations. This paper mainly focuses on the effectiveness of a blockchain-based system in company procurements.",

    "abstract": "Deploying mobile edge computing (MEC) server in the mobile blockchain-enabled Internet of things (IoT) system is a promising approach to improve the system performance, however, it imposes a significant challenge on the trust of MEC server. To address this problem, we first propose an untrusted MEC proof of work scheme in mobile blockchain network where plenty of nonce hash computing demands can be offloaded to MEC server. Then, we design a nonce ordering algorithm for this scheme to provide fairer computing resource allocation for all mobile IoT devices/users. Specifically, we formulate the user's nonce selection strategy as a non-cooperative game, where the utilities of individual user are maximized in the untrusted MEC-aided mobile blockchain network. We also prove the existence of Nash equilibrium and analyze that the cooperation behavior is unsuitable for the blockchain-enabled IoT devices by using the repeated game. Finally, we design the blockchain's difficulty adjustment mechanism to ensure stable block times during a long period of time.",

We featurize Monero transactions by characterizing the local structure of the public-facing blockchains and use labels obtained from the simulations to perform machine learning. Machine Learning of our features on the simulated blockchain shows that the technique can be used to aide in identifying individuals and groups, although it did not successfully reveal the hidden transaction values. We apply the technique on the real Monero blockchain to identify ShapeShift transactions, a cryptocurrency exchange that has leaked information through their API providing labels for themselves and their users.",

ELF supports users (i) in generating cost-efficient logging code readily embeddable into smart contracts and (ii) in extracting log analysis data into common formats regardless of whether the code generation has been used during development. We provide an overview of and rationale for the framework's features, outline implementation details, and demonstrate ELF's versatility based on three case studies from the public Ethereum blockchain.",

    "abstract": "With the recent popularity of Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), blockchain enabled smart contract applications has attracted increased research focus. However, the immutability of the blocks, where the smart contracts are stored, causes conflicts with the traditional Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models usually followed by software engineers. This clearly shows the unsuitability of the application of SDLC in designing blockchain enabled smart contract based applications. This research article addresses this current problem by first exploring the six traditional SDLC models, clearly identifying the conflicts in a table with the application of smart contracts and advocates that there is an urgent need to develop new standard model(s) to address the arising issues. The concept of both block immutability and contract is introduced. This is further set in a historical context from legacy smart contracts and blockchain enabled smart contracts extending to the difference between \"shallow smart contracts\" and \"deep smart contracts\". To conclude, the traditional SDLC models are unsuitable for blockchain enabled smart contract-based applications.",

This paper advocates to leverage blockchains to deliver immutable and autonomous data provenance services such that scientific data are trustworthy. The challenges for adopting blockchains to HPC include designing a new blockchain architecture compatible with the HPC platforms and, more importantly, a set of new consensus protocols for scientific applications atop blockchains. To this end, we have designed the proof-of-scalable-traceability (POST) protocol and implemented it in a blockchain prototype, namely SciChain, the very first blockchain system for HPC. We evaluated SciChain by comparing it with multiple state-of-the-art systems; Experimental results showed that SciChain guaranteed trustworthy data while incurring orders of magnitude lower overhead.",

These limitations are related to the effects of maintaining a durable blockchain instead of a write-ahead log and the requirement for reconfiguring the set of replicas in a decentralized way. We demonstrate these limitations using a digital coin blockchain application and BFT-SMaRt, a popular BFT replication library. We show how they can be addressed both at a conceptual level, in a protocol-agnostic way, and by implementing SMaRtChain, a blockchain platform based on BFT-SMaRt. SMaRtChain improves the performance of our digital coin application by a factor of eight when compared with a naive implementation on top of BFT-SMaRt. Moreover, SMaRtChain achieves a throughput $8\\times$ and $33\\times$ better than Tendermint and Hyperledger Fabric, respectively, when ensuring strong durability on its blockchain.",

Nevertheless, whether an equilibrium exists for three or more pools of distinct sizes remains an open problem. To this end, this paper studies the equilibrium in a blockchain of arbitrary pools. First, we show that the equilibrium among $q$ identical pools, coinciding the result demonstrated by Eyal through game theory, can be constructed using a topological approach. Second, if the pools are of different size, we show that (i) if the blockchain's pools exhibit two distinct sizes, an equilibrium can be reached, and (ii) if the blockchain has at least three distinct pool sizes, there does not exist an equilibrium.",

This can be leveraged to support distributed workflow management. Compared to proof-of-work consensus, popularized by Bitcoin and Ethereum, blockchains based on BFT (byzantine fault tolerance) ordering consensus trade scalability for immediacy and finality of consensus. This makes them easier to use as distribution infrastructure, as applications need not be adapted to deal with eventual consistency and delayed consensus of proof-of-work blockchains. Hence, applications such as workflow engines can be easily ported to such a blockchain infrastructure to take advantage of their decentralized integrity assurance and information distribution model. In this paper we describe how the YAWL workflow engine can be used on a BFT based blockchain infrastructure to enable collaborative workflows across different organizations.",

Even though there is renewed interest in BFT consensus algorithms with various proposals targeting Permissioned Blockchains, related work does not optimize for fast networks and does not incorporate hardware accelerators -- we make the case that doing so will pay off in the long run. To this end, we re-implemented the seminal PBFT algorithm in a way that allows us to measure different configurations of the protocol. Through this we explore the benefits of various common optimization strategies and show that the protocol is unlikely to saturate more than 10Gbps networks without relying on specialized hardware-based offloading. We discuss two concrete ways in which the cost of consensus in Permissioned Blockchains could be reduced in high speed networking environments, namely, offloading to SmartNICs and implementing the protocol on standalone FPGAs.",

Blockchain features can likely improve interoperability and access control to health data, and at the same time, preserve or even increase, the privacy of patients. Blockchain applications should address compliance with the current regulatory framework to increase real-world feasibility.

In this architecture, the detection agency first detects copyrights off the chain, then uploads the detection records to the blockchain. Since data on the blockchain are publicly accessible, media providers can verify the correctness of the copyright detection, and appeal to a smart contract if there is any dissent. The smart contract then arbitrates the disputes by verifying the correctness of detection on the chain. The detect-verify-and-arbitrate mechanism guarantees the credibility of copyright detection. Privacy and security analysis and experimental simulations show that the digital copyright detection architecture is reliable, secure and efficient.",

The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this survey, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of incentivized consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review on the strategy adoption for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey on the emerging applications of the blockchain networks in a wide range of areas. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol design for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.",

Device classification methods are employed to enhance the security of IoT by detecting unregistered devices or traffic patterns. In recent years, blockchain has received tremendous attention as a distributed trustless platform to enhance the security of IoT. Conventional device identification methods are not directly applicable in blockchain-based IoT as network layer packets are not stored in the blockchain. Moreover, the transactions are broadcast and thus have no destination IP address and contain a public key as the user identity, and are stored permanently in blockchain which can be read by any entity in the network. We show that device identification in blockchain introduces privacy risks as the malicious nodes can identify users' activity pattern by analyzing the temporal pattern of their transactions in the blockchain. We study the likelihood of classifying IoT devices by analyzing their information stored in the blockchain, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first work of its kind. We use a smart home as a representative IoT scenario. First, a blockchain is populated according to a real-world smart home traffic dataset. We then apply machine learning algorithms on the data stored in the blockchain to analyze the success rate of device classification, modeling both an informed and a blind attacker. Our results demonstrate success rates over 90\\% in classifying devices. We propose three timestamp obfuscation methods, namely combining multiple packets into a single transaction, merging ledgers of multiple devices, and randomly delaying transactions, to reduce the success rate in classifying devices. The proposed timestamp obfuscation methods can reduce the classification success rates to as low as 20%.",

    "abstract": "Most popular blockchain solutions, like Bitcoin, rely on proof-of-work, guaranteeing that the output of the consensus is agreed upon with high probability. However, this probability depends on the delivery of messages and that the computational power of the system is sufficiently scattered among pools of nodes in the network so that no pool can mine more blocks faster than the crowd. New approaches, like Ethereum, generalise the proof-of-work approach by letting individuals deploy their own private blockchain with high transaction throughput. As companies are starting to deploy private chains, it has become crucial to better understand the guarantees blockchains offer in such a small and controlled environment. In this paper, we present the \\emph{Blockchain Anomaly}, an execution that we experienced when building our private chain at NICTA/Data61. Even though this anomaly has never been acknowledged before, it may translate into dramatic consequences for the user of blockchains. Named after the infamous Paxos anomaly, this anomaly makes dependent transactions, like \"Bob sends money to Carole after he received money from Alice\" impossible. This anomaly relies on the fact that existing blockchains do not ensure consensus safety deterministically: there is no way for Bob to make sure that Alice actually sent him coins without Bob using an external mechanism, like converting these coins into a fiat currency that allows him to withdraw. We also explore smart contracts as a potential alternative to transactions in order to freeze coins, and show implementations of smart contract that can suffer from the Blockchain anomaly and others that may cope with it.",

Furthermore, technology like Internet has been a fertile ground for innovation and creativity. One of such disruptive innovation is blockchain -- a keystone of cryptocurrencies. The blockchain technology is presented as a game changer for many of the existing and emerging technologies/services. With its immutability property and decentralised architecture, it is taking centre stage in many services as an equalisation factor to the current parity between consumers and large corporations/governments. One of such potential applications of the blockchain is in e-voting schemes. The objective of such a scheme would be to provide a decentralised architecture to run and support a voting scheme that is open, fair and independently verifiable. In this paper, we propose potentially a new e-voting protocol that utilises the blockchain as a transparent ballot box. The protocol has been designed with adhering to the fundamental e-voting properties in mind as well as offering a degree of decentralisation and allowing for the voter to change/update their vote (within the permissible voting period). The paper highlights the pros and cons of using blockchain for such a proposal from practical point view in both development/deployment and usage contexts. Concluding the paper with a potential roadmap for blockchain technology to be able to support complex applications.",

    "abstract": "The governance of data used for biomedical research and clinical trials is an important requirement for generating accurate results. To improve the visibility of data quality and analysis, we developed TrialChain, a blockchain-based platform that can be used to validate data integrity from large, biomedical research studies. We implemented a private blockchain using the MultiChain platform and integrated it with a data science platform deployed within a large research center. An administrative web application was built with Python to manage the platform, which was built with a microservice architecture using Docker. The TrialChain platform was integrated during data acquisition into our existing data science platform. Using NiFi, data were hashed and logged within the local blockchain infrastructure. To provide public validation, the local blockchain state was periodically synchronized to the public Ethereum network. The use of a combined private/public blockchain platform allows for both public validation of results while maintaining additional security and lower cost for blockchain transactions. Original data and modifications due to downstream analysis can be logged within TrialChain and data assets or results can be rapidly validated when needed using API calls to the platform. The TrialChain platform provides a data governance solution to audit the acquisition and analysis of biomedical research data. The platform provides cryptographic assurance of data authenticity and can also be used to document data analysis.",

    "abstract": "The emerging blockchain protocols provide a decentralized architecture that is suitable of supporting Internet of Things (IoT) interactions. However, keeping a local copy of the blockchain ledger is infeasible for low-power and memory-constrained devices. For this reason, they are equipped with lightweight software implementations that only download the useful data structures, e.g. state of accounts, from the blockchain network, when they are updated. In this paper, we consider and analyze a novel scheme, implemented by the nodes of the blockchain network, which aggregates the blockchain data in periodic updates and further reduces the communication cost of the connected IoT devices. We show that the aggregation period should be selected based on the channel quality, the offered rate, and the statistics of updates of the useful data structures. The results, obtained for the Ethereum protocol, illustrate the benefits of the aggregation scheme in terms of a reduced duty cycle of the device, particularly for low signal-to-noise ratios, and the overall reduction of the amount of information transmitted in downlink (e.g., from the wireless base station to the IoT device). A potential application of the proposed scheme is to let the IoT device request more information than actually needed, hence increasing its privacy, while keeping the communication cost constant. In conclusion, our work is the first to provide rigorous guidelines for the design of lightweight blockchain protocols with wireless connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Within the last few years, a countless number of blockchain systems have emerged on the market, each one claiming to revolutionize the way of distributed transaction processing in one way or the other. Many blockchain features, such as byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), are indeed valuable additions in modern environments. However, despite all the hype around the technology, many of the challenges that blockchain systems have to face are fundamental transaction management problems. These are largely shared with traditional database systems, which have been around for decades already. These similarities become especially visible for systems, that blur the lines between blockchain systems and classical database systems. A great example of this is Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source permissioned blockchain system under development by IBM. By having a relaxed view on BFT, the transaction pipeline of Fabric highly resembles the workflow of classical distributed databases systems. This raises two questions: (1) Which conceptual similarities and differences do actually exist between a system such as Fabric and a classical distributed database system? (2) Is it possible to improve on the performance of Fabric by transitioning technology from the database world to blockchains and thus blurring the lines between these two types of systems even further? To tackle these questions, we first explore Fabric from the perspective of database research, where we observe weaknesses in the transaction pipeline. We then solve these issues by transitioning well-understood database concepts to Fabric, namely transaction reordering as well as early transaction abort. Our experimental evaluation shows that our improved version Fabric++ significantly increases the throughput of successful transactions over the vanilla version by up to a factor of 3x.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain protocols are based on a distributed database where stored data is guaranteed to be immutable. The requirement that all nodes have to maintain their own local copy of the database ensures security while consensus mechanisms help deciding which data gets added to the database and keep powerful adversaries from derailing the system. However, since the database that forms the foundation of a blockchain is a continuously growing list of blocks, scalability is an inherent problem of this technology. Some public blockchains need a few 100 GB to Terabytes of storage. In this work, we present the concept Superlight with self-contained proofs, which is designed to improve scalability of a public blockchain, while preserving security and decentralization. Instead of all nodes having a local copy of the whole blockchain to verify a transaction, nodes can derive the validity of a transaction by only using block headers. To keep the block headers compact, BLS signatures are used to combine signatures. We provide a definition of SCPs and show the required steps of a client to create a proof that is accepted by other nodes for transferring funds. The advantage of such a light-client-only blockchain is the lower storage requirement, while the drawback is an increased computational complexity due to BLS signatures, limited use-cases due to lack of a global state, and the requirement for an interactive protocol between sender, receiver, and miner to create a transaction.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has attracted a broad range of interests from start-ups, enterprises and governments to build next generation applications in a decentralized manner. Similar to cloud platforms, a single blockchain-based system may need to serve multiple tenants simultaneously. However, design of multi-tenant blockchain-based systems is challenging to architects in terms of data and performance isolation, as well as scalability. First, tenants must not be able to read other tenants' data and tenants with potentially higher workload should not affect read/write performance of other tenants. Second, multi-tenant blockchain-based systems usually require both scalability for each individual tenant and scalability with number of tenants. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a scalable platform architecture for multi-tenant blockchain-based systems to ensure data integrity while maintaining data privacy and performance isolation. In the proposed architecture, each tenant has an individual permissioned blockchain to maintain their own data and smart contracts. All tenant chains are anchored into a main chain, in a way that minimizes cost and load overheads. The proposed architecture has been implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype with our industry partner, Laava ID Pty Ltd (Laava). We evaluate our proposal in a three-fold way: fulfilment of the identified requirements, qualitative comparison with design alternatives, and quantitative analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed architecture can achieve data integrity, performance isolation, data privacy, configuration flexibility, availability, cost efficiency and scalability.",

Motivated by this, we leverage the rich features, decades of research and optimization, and available tooling in relational databases to build a blockchain relational database. We consider a permissioned blockchain model of known, but mutually distrustful organizations each operating their own database instance that are replicas of one another. The replicas execute transactions independently and engage in decentralized consensus to determine the commit order for transactions. We design two approaches, the first where the commit order for transactions is agreed upon prior to executing them, and the second where transactions are executed without prior knowledge of the commit order while the ordering happens in parallel. We leverage serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) to guarantee that the replicas across nodes remain consistent and respect the ordering determined by consensus, and devise a new variant of SSI based on block height for the latter approach. We implement our system on PostgreSQL and present detailed performance experiments analyzing both approaches.",

The existing blockchain solutions have downsides in communication and storage efficiency, convergence to centralization, and consistency problems. In this paper, we propose LightChain, which is the first blockchain architecture that operates over a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) of participating peers. LightChain is a permissionless blockchain that provides addressable blocks and transactions within the network, which makes them efficiently accessible by all the peers. Each block and transaction is replicated within the DHT of peers and is retrieved in an on-demand manner. Hence, peers in LightChain are not required to retrieve or keep the entire blockchain. LightChain is fair as all of the participating peers have a uniform chance of being involved in the consensus regardless of their influence such as hashing power or stake. LightChain provides a deterministic fork-resolving strategy as well as a blacklisting mechanism, and it is secure against colluding adversarial peers attacking the availability and integrity of the system. We provide mathematical analysis and experimental results on scenarios involving 10K nodes to demonstrate the security and fairness of LightChain. As we experimentally show in this paper, compared to the mainstream blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, LightChain requires around 66 times less per node storage, and is around 380 times faster on bootstrapping a new node to the system, while each LightChain node is rewarded equally likely for participating in the protocol.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of efficiently disseminating authenticated blockchain information from blockchain nodes (servers) to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, through a wireless base station (BS). In existing blockchain protocols, upon generation of a new block, each IoT device receives a copy of the block header, authenticated via digital signature by one or more trusted servers. Since it relies on unicast transmissions, the required communication resources grow linearly with the number of IoT devices. We propose a more efficient scheme, in which a single copy of each block header is multicasted, together with the signatures of servers. In addition, if IoT devices tolerate a delay, we exploit the blockchain structure to amortize the authentication in time, by transmitting only a subset of signature in each block period. Finally, the BS sends redundant information, via a repetition code, to deal with the unreliable wireless channel, with the aim of decreasing the amount of feedback required from IoT devices. Our analysis shows the trade-off between timely authentication of blocks and reliability of the communication, depending on the packet loss rate offered by the channel. The numerical results show that the performance benefits of the proposed scheme makes it a viable starting point for designing new lightweight protocols for blockchains.",

    "abstract": "It is a common narrative that blockchains are immutable and so it is technically impossible to erase data stored on them. For legal and ethical reasons, however, individuals and organizations might be compelled to erase locally stored data, be it encoded on a blockchain or not. The common assumption for blockchain networks like Bitcoin is that forcing nodes to erase data contained on the blockchain is equal to permanently restricting them from participating in the system in a full-node role. Challenging this belief, in this paper, we propose and demonstrate a pragmatic approach towards functionality-preserving local erasure (FPLE). FPLE enables full nodes to erase infringing or undesirable data while continuing to store and validate most of the blockchain. We describe a general FPLE approach for UTXO-based (i.e., Bitcoin-like) cryptocurrencies and present a lightweight proof-of-concept tool for safely erasing transaction data from the local storage of Bitcoin Core nodes. Erasing nodes continue to operate in tune with the network even when erased transaction outputs become relevant for validating subsequent blocks. Using only our basic proof-of-concept implementation, we are already able to safely comply with a significantly larger range of erasure requests than, to the best of our knowledge, any other full node operator so far.",

Communication is needed between Ethereum Private Sidechains to allow a function in a contract on one sidechain to execute function calls which return values from, or update the state of, another sidechain. We propose a crosschain technique which allows transactions to be executed atomically across sidechains, introduce a new mechanism for proving values across sidechains, describe a transaction locking mechanism which works in the context of blockchain to enable atomic transactions, and a methodology for providing a global time-out across sidechains. We outline the programming model to be used with this technology and provide as an example, a variable amount atomic swap contract for exchanging value between sidechains.

There is an emerging trend beyond payments that blockchains could enable a new breed of decentralized applications, and serve as the foundation for Internet's security infrastructure. The immutable nature of the blockchain makes it a winner on security and transparency; it is nearly inconceivable for ledgers to be altered in a way not instantly clear to every single user involved. However, most blockchains fall short in privacy aspects, particularly in data protection. Garlic Routing and Onion Routing are two of major Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PETs) which are popular for anonymization and security. Garlic Routing is a methodology using by I2P Anonymous Network to hide the identity of sender and receiver of data packets by bundling multiple messages into a layered encryption structure. The Onion Routing attempts to provide lowlatency Internet-based connections that resist traffic analysis, deanonymization attack, eavesdropping, and other attacks both by outsiders (e.g. Internet routers) and insiders (Onion Routing servers themselves). As there are a few controversies over the rate of resistance of these two techniques to privacy attacks, we propose a PET-Enabled Sidechain (PETES) as a new privacy enhancing technique by integrating Garlic Routing and Onion Routing into a Garlic Onion Routing (GOR) framework suitable to the structure of blockchains. The preliminary proposed GOR aims to improve the privacy of transactions in blockchains via PETES structure.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel framework that uses wireless mobile miners (MMs) for computation purposes in a blockchain system is proposed. In the introduced system, the blockchain ledger is located at the communication nodes (CNs), and the MMs associated with CNs process the blockchain's proof-of-work (PoW) computation to verify the originality of the data. The MM that is the first to finish its PoW will receive a reward by sending its computing result to the CNs that are connected to other MMs. In the considered scenario, a blockchain forking event occurs if the MM having the shortest PoW delay fails to be the first to update its computing result to other MMs. To enable such mobile operations for a blockchain with minimum forking events, it is imperative to maintain low-latency wireless communications between MMs and CNs. To analyze the sensitivity of the system to latency, the probability of occurrence of a forking event is theoretically derived. The system is then designed so as to compute the forked block's PoW again to recover from a forking event. For this case, the average energy consumption of an MM is derived as a function of the system parameters such as the number of MMs and power consumed by the computing, transmission, and mobility processes of the MMs. Simulation results verify the analytical derivations and show that using a larger number of MMs can reduce the energy consumption by up to 94.5% compared to a blockchain system with a single MM.",

    "abstract": "Distributed Leger Technologies (DLTs), most notably Blockchain technologies, bring decentralised platforms that eliminate a single trusted third party and avoid the notorious single point of failure vulnerability. Since Nakamoto's Bitcoin cryptocurrency system, an enormous number of decentralised applications have been proposed on top of these technologies, aiming at more transparency and trustworthiness than their traditional counterparts. These applications spread over a lot of areas, e.g. financial services, healthcare, transportation, supply chain management, and cloud computing. While Blockchain brings transparency and decentralised trust intuitively due to the consensus of a (very large) group of nodes (or, miners), it introduces very subtle implications for other desirable properties such as privacy. In this work, we demonstrate these subtle implications for Blockchain-based searchable encryption solutions, which are one specific use case of cloud computing services. These solutions rely on Blockchain to achieve both the standard privacy property and the new fairness property, which requires that search operations are carried out faithfully and are rewarded accordingly. We show that directly replacing the server in an existing searchable encryption solution with a Blockchain will cause undesirable operational cost, privacy loss, and security vulnerabilities. The analysis results indicate that a dedicated server is still needed to achieve the desired privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose two frameworks which can be instantiated based on most existing searchable encryption schemes. Through analysing these two frameworks, we affirmatively show that a carefully engineered Blockchain-based solution can achieve the desired fairness property while preserving the privacy guarantee of the original searchable encryption scheme simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "A blockchain is a database of sequential events that is maintained by a distributed group of nodes. A key consensus problem in blockchains is that of determining the next block (data element) in the sequence. Many blockchains address this by electing a new node to propose each new block. The new block is (typically) appended to the tip of the proposer's local blockchain, and subsequently broadcast to the rest of the network. Without network delay (or adversarial behavior), this procedure would give a perfect chain, since each proposer would have the same view of the blockchain. A major challenge in practice is forking. Due to network delays, a proposer may not yet have the most recent block, and may, therefore, create a side chain that branches from the middle of the main chain. Forking reduces throughput, since only one a single main chain can survive, and all other blocks are discarded. We propose a new P2P protocol for blockchains called Barracuda, in which each proposer, prior to proposing a block, polls $\\ell$ other nodes for their local blocktree information. Under a stochastic network model, we prove that this lightweight primitive improves throughput as if the entire network were a factor of $\\ell$ faster. We provide guidelines on how to implement Barracuda in practice, guaranteeing robustness against several real-world factors.",

To date, however, there is not a lightweight and secure privacy-preserving solution for video surveillance systems.

In this paper, we propose a Lightweight, Blockchain-based Privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme for surveillance cameras at the edge.

The Lib-Pri system transforms the deployed VSS into a system that functions as a federated blockchain network capable of carrying out integrity checking, blurring keys management, feature sharing, and video access sanctioning. The policy-based enforcement of privacy measures is carried out at the edge devices for real-time video analytics without cluttering the network.",

It offers a peer-to-peer network of nodes with no centralised governing entity making it unhackable and therefore, more secure than the traditional paper-based or centralised system of records like banks etc. While there are certain advantages to the paper-based recording approach, it does not work well with digital relationships where the data is in constant flux. Unlike traditional channels, governed by centralized entities, blockchain offers its users a certain level of anonymity by providing capabilities to interact without disclosing their personal identities and allows them to build trust without a third-party governing entity. Due to the aforementioned characteristics of blockchain, more and more users around the globe are inclined towards making a digital transaction via blockchain than via rudimentary channels. Therefore, there is a dire need for us to gain insight on how these transactions are processed by the blockchain and how much time it may take for a peer to confirm a transaction and add it to the blockchain network. This paper presents a novel approach that would allow one to estimate the time, in block time or otherwise, it would take for a mining node to accept and confirm a transaction to a block using machine learning. The paper also aims to compare the predictive accuracy of two machine learning regression models- Random Forest Regressor and Multilayer Perceptron against previously proposed statistical regression model under a set evaluation criterion. The objective is to determine whether machine learning offers a more accurate predictive model than conventional statistical models. The proposed model results in improved accuracy in prediction.",

    "abstract": "This work applies reinforcement learning (RL) from the AI machine learning field to derive an optimal Bitcoin-like blockchain mining strategy without knowing the details of the blockchain network model. Previously, the most profitable mining strategy was believed to be honest mining encoded in the default blockchain protocol. It was shown later that it is possible to gain more mining rewards by deviating from honest mining. In particular, the mining problem can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) which can be solved to give the optimal mining strategy. However, solving the mining MDP requires knowing the values of various parameters that characterize the blockchain network model. In real blockchain networks, these parameter values are not easy to obtain and may change over time. This hinders the use of the MDP model-based solution. In this work, we employ RL to dynamically learn a mining strategy with performance approaching that of the optimal mining strategy by observing and interacting with the network. Since the mining MDP problem has a non-linear objective function (rather than linear functions of standard MDP problems), we design a new multi-dimensional RL algorithm to solve the problem. Experimental results indicate that, without knowing the parameter values of the mining MDP model, our multi-dimensional RL mining algorithm can still achieve the optimal performance over time-varying blockchain networks.",

    "abstract": "Randpay is a technology developed in Emercoin for blockchain micropayments that can be more effective in some scenarios than the Lightning Network as we show in the paper. The protocol is based on the concept of Ronald L. Rivest and published in the paper \"Electronic Lottery Tickets as Micropayments\" (1997). The \"lottery ticket\" was designed for centralized systems where a trusted third party is required to provide payments, and in some scenarios is also a lottery facilitator. The existing blockchain protocol cannot accommodate peer-to-peer \"lottery\" micropayments at least without the need to create payment channels, which is analysed in the paper. Therefore, the implementation required the development of an update to the blockchain core. In the result, RandpayUTXO was introduced - infinitely spendable zero output that requires the payee's signature to be published in the blockchain. Randpay is considered to be the first blockchain protocol to require the payee to sign the transaction by their private key. This is a significant feature to improve not only microtransactions but also extend the use of the blockchain for legal deeds that require a payee's consent to be recognised in legal applications. The second important innovation of this research is the implementation of Blum's \"coin flipping by telephone\" problem to design a \"lottery ticket\" that does not require any third party to facilitate the lottery. The paper offers an API description, an analysis of the mathematical model, and proof of how \"lottery\" can be beneficial. There is also an attack analysis and overview of existing solutions.",

    "abstract": "Proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency blockchains like Bitcoin secure vast amounts of money. Their operators, called miners, expend resources to generate blocks and receive monetary rewards for their effort. Blockchains are, in principle, attractive targets for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks: There is fierce competition among coins, as well as potential gains from short selling. Classical DoS attacks, however, typically target a few servers and cannot scale to systems with many nodes. There have been no successful DoS attacks to date against prominent cryptocurrencies. We present Blockchain DoS (BDoS), the first incentive-based DoS attack that targets PoW cryptocurrencies. Unlike classical DoS, BDoS targets the system's mechanism design: It exploits the reward mechanism to discourage miner participation. Previous DoS attacks against PoW blockchains require an adversary's mining power to match that of all other miners. In contrast, BDoS can cause a blockchain to grind to a halt with significantly fewer resources, e.g., 21% as of March 2020 in Bitcoin, according to our empirical study. We find that Bitcoin's vulnerability to BDoS increases rapidly as the mining industry matures and profitability drops. BDoS differs from known attacks like Selfish Mining in its aim not to increase an adversary's revenue, but to disrupt the system. Although it bears some algorithmic similarity to those attacks, it introduces a new adversarial model, goals, algorithm, and game-theoretic analysis. Beyond its direct implications for operational blockchains, BDoS introduces the novel idea that an adversary can manipulate miners' incentives by proving the existence of blocks without actually publishing them.",

More recently, the Blockchain and the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more and more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications. Some people have come to the point of saying that the \"Blockchain revolution\" can be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a result, all software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried software development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis which does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of software engineering are taken into account. This paper tries to cope with this issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement, analyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process is based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and incremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more formal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the system, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain development. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to show how it works.",

The rapid evolution in blockchain technologies, which relied on a decentralized, immutable and distributed ledger system for transaction data auditing, provides a prospective solution to address the issues in IoT. The blockchain and smart contract enabled security mechanism for IoT applications have attracted increasing interests from both academia and industry. However, integrating cryptocurrency-oriented blockchain technologies into IoT systems meets tremendous challenges on scalability, storage capacity, security, and privacy. Particularly, the performance of blockchain networks significantly relies on the performance of consensus mechanisms, e.g., in terms of data confidentiality, transaction throughput, and network scalability. In this chapter, given an in-depth review of state-of-the-art blockchain networks, the key matrix of designing consensus mechanism for IoT networks are identified in terms of throughput, scalability, and security. To demonstrate a case study on designing scalable, lightweight blockchain protocols for IoT systems, a Microchain framework is introduced and a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented in a physical network environment. The experimental results verify the feasibility of integrating the Microchain into IoT systems.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment system proposed by Nakamoto in 2008. Based on the Nakamoto consensus, Bagaria, Kannan, Tse, Fanti, and Viswanath proposed the Prism protocol in 2018 and showed that it achieves near-optimal blockchain throughput while maintaining a similar level of security as bitcoin. Previous probabilistic security guarantees for the bitcoin and Prism backbone protocols were either established under a simplified discrete-time model or expressed in terms of exponential order results. This paper presents a streamlined and strengthened analysis under a more realistic continuous-time model. A fully rigorous model for blockchains is developed with no restrictions on adversarial miners except for an upper bound on their aggregate mining rate. The only assumption on the peer-to-peer network is that all block propagation delays are upper bounded by a constant. A new notion of \"t-credible blockchains\" is introduced, which, together with some carefully defined \"typical\" events concerning block production over time intervals, is crucial to establish probabilisitic security guarantees in continuous time. A blockchain growth theorem, a blockchain quality theorem, and a common prefix theorem are established with explicit probability bounds. Moreover, under a certain typical event which occurs with probability close to $1$, a valid transaction that is deep enough in one credible blockchain is shown to be permanent in the sense that it must be found in} in all future credible blockchains.",

Similarly, AI developers can utilize compute resources from cloud vendors without loosing ownership or privacy of their trained models. Our system protocols are set up to incentivize all three entities - data owners, cloud vendors, and AI developers to truthfully record their actions on the distributed ledger, so that the blockchain system provides verifiable evidence of wrongdoing and dispute resolution. Our system is implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric and can provide a viable alternative to centralized AI systems that do not guarantee data or model privacy. We present experimental performance results that demonstrate the latency and throughput of its transactions under different network configurations where peers on the blockchain may be spread across different datacenters and geographies. Our results indicate that the proposed solution scales well to large number of data and model owners and can train up to 70 models per second on a 12-peer non optimized blockchain network and roughly 30 models per second in a 24 peer network.",

While this paradigm has been widely adopted in industry, it has not been carefully analyzed in terms of its network scaling with respect to the number of peers. Applications for blockchain systems, such as cryptocurrencies and IoT, require this form of network scaling. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic network model for a blockchain system. We identify a structural property called \\emph{one-endedness}, which we show to be desirable in any blockchain system as it is directly related to distributed consensus among the peers. We show that the stochastic stability of the network is sufficient for the one-endedness of a blockchain. We further establish that our model belongs to a class of network models, called monotone separable models. This allows us to establish upper and lower bounds on the stability region. The bounds on stability depend on the connectivity of the P2P network through its conductance and allow us to analyze the scalability of blockchain systems on large P2P networks. We verify our theoretical insights using both synthetic data and real data from the Bitcoin network.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain sharding is a promising approach to solving the dilemma between decentralisation and high performance (transaction throughput) for blockchain. The main challenge of Blockchain sharding systems is how to reach a decision on a statement among a sub-group (shard) of people while ensuring the whole population recognises this statement. Namely, the challenge is to prevent an adversary who does not have the majority of nodes globally but have the majority of nodes inside a shard. Most Blockchain sharding approaches can only reach a correct consensus inside a shard with at most $n/3$ evil nodes in a $n$ node system. There is a blockchain sharding approach which can prevent an incorrect decision to be reached when the adversary does not have $n/2$ nodes globally. However, the system can be stopped from reaching consensus (become deadlocked) if the adversary controls a smaller number of nodes. In this paper, we present an improved Blockchain sharding approach that can withstand $n/2$ adversarial nodes and recover from deadlocks. The recovery is made by dynamically adjusting the number of shards and the shard size. A performance analysis suggests our approach has a high performance (transaction throughput) while requiring little bandwidth for synchronisation.",

The main challenges here are to verify the validity of data and to prevent malicious behavior of the parties, while preserving the privacy of the data and taking into account the limited computing and storage resources available on the blockchain. In BlockMarkchain, the buyer has the option to dispute the honesty of the seller and prove the invalidity of the data to the smart contract. The smart contract evaluates the buyer's claim and punishes the dishonest party by forfeiting his/her deposit in favor of the honest party. BlockMarkchain enjoys several salient features including (i) the certified data has never been revealed on the public blockchain, (ii) the size of data posted on the blockchain, the load of computation on the blockchain, and the cost of communication with the blockchain is constant and negligible, and (iii) the computation cost of verifications on the parties is not expensive.",

However, the increased attack surface offered by the growing number of connected vulnerable devices and complex nature of SDN control plane applications could overturn the huge benefits of such a system. This paper addresses the vulnerability of some unspecified security flaw in the SDN control plane application (such as a zero-day software vulnerability) which can be exploited to insert malicious flow rules in the switch that do not match network policies. Specifically, we propose a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) based framework that supports switch flow verification and insertion; and additionally provides straightforward deployment of blockchain technology within an existing SDN infrastructure. While use of an external BaaS brings straightforward deployment, it obscures knowledge of the blockchain agents who are responsible for flow conformance testing through a smart blockchain contract, leading to potential exploitation. Thus, we design a strategy to prevent the blockchain agents from acting arbitrarily, as this would result in what is termed a \"moral hazard\". We achieve this by developing a novel mathematical model of the fair reward scheme based on game theory. To understand the performance of our system, we evaluate our model using a Matlab based simulation framework. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm balances the needs of the blockchain agents to maximise the overall social welfare, i.e. the sum of profits across all parties.",

To favor availability against consistency in the face of partitions, most blockchains only offer probabilistic eventual finality: blocks may be revoked after being appended to the blockchain, yet with decreasing probability as they sink deeper into the chain. Other blockchains favor consistency by leveraging the immediate finality of Consensus-a block appended is never revoked-at the cost of additional synchronization. In this paper, we focus on necessary and sufficient conditions to implement a blockchain with deterministic eventual finality, which ensures that selected main chains at different processes share a common increasing prefix. This is a much weaker form of finality that allows us to provide a solution in an asynchronous system subject to unlimited number of byzantine failures. We study stronger forms of eventual finality as well and show that it is unfortunately impossible to provide a bounded displacement. By bounded displacement we mean that the (unknown) number of blocks that can be revoked from the current blockchain is bounded. This problem reduces to consensus or eventual consensus depending on whether the bound is known or not. We also show that the classical selection mechanism, such as in Bitcoin, that appends blocks at the longest chain is not compliant with a solution to eventual finality.",

Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms. In this paper, we first describe BlockBench, the first evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BlockBench via simple APIs and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart contracts. BlockBench measures overall and component-wise performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use BlockBench to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices at different layers of the software stack.",

While blockchain is thought primarily as the basis of Bitcoin, its application has grown far beyond cryptocurrencies due to the introduction of smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-enforcing pieces of software, which reside and run over a hosting blockchain. Using blockchain-based smart contracts for secure and transparent management to govern interactions (authentication, connection, and transaction) in Internet-enabled environments, mostly IoT, is a niche area of research and practice. However, writing trustworthy and safe smart contracts can be tremendously challenging because of the complicated semantics of underlying domain-specific languages and its testability. There have been high-profile incidents that indicate blockchain smart contracts could contain various code-security vulnerabilities, instigating financial harms. When it involves security of smart contracts, developers embracing the ability to write the contracts should be capable of testing their code, for diagnosing security vulnerabilities, before deploying them to the immutable environments on blockchains. However, there are only a handful of security testing tools for smart contracts. This implies that the existing research on automatic smart contracts security testing is not adequate and remains in a very stage of infancy. With a specific goal to more readily realize the application of blockchain smart contracts in security and privacy, we should first understand their vulnerabilities before widespread implementation. Accordingly, the goal of this paper is to carry out a far-reaching experimental assessment of current static smart contracts security testing tools, for the most widely used blockchain, the Ethereum and its domain-specific programming language, Solidity to provide the first...",

For such a more general blockchain queueing model, we focus on two basic research aspects: (1) By using the matrix-geometric solution, we first obtain a sufficient stable condition of the blockchain system. Then we provide simple expressions for the average number of transactions in the queueing waiting room, and the average number of transactions in the block. (2) However, comparing with Li et al. \\cite{Li:2018}, analysis of the transaction-confirmation time becomes very difficult and challenging due to the complicated blockchain structure. To overcome the difficulties, we develop a computational technique of the first passage times by means of both the PH distributions of infinite sizes and the $RG$-factorizations. Finally, we hope that the methodology and results given in this paper will open a new avenue to queueing analysis of more general blockchain systems in practice, and can motivate a series of promising future research on development of lockchain technologies.",

    "abstract": "Feeding external data to a blockchain, a.k.a. data feed, is an essential task to enable blockchain interoperability and support emerging cross-domain applications, notably stablecoins. Given the data-intensive feeds in real life (e.g., high-frequency price updates) and the high cost in using blockchain, namely Gas, it is imperative to reduce the Gas cost of data feeds. Motivated by the constant-changing workloads in finance and other applications, this work focuses on designing a dynamic, workload-aware approach for cost effectiveness in Gas. This design space is understudied in the existing blockchain research which has so far focused on static data placement. This work presents GRuB, a cost-effective data feed that dynamically replicates data between the blockchain and an off-chain cloud storage. GRuB's data replication is workload-adaptive by monitoring the current workload and making online decisions w.r.t. data replication. A series of online algorithms are proposed that achieve the bounded worst-case cost in blockchain's Gas. GRuB runs the decision-making components on the untrusted cloud off-chain for lower Gas costs, and employs a security protocol to authenticate the data transferred between the blockchain and cloud. The overall GRuB system can autonomously achieve low Gas costs with changing workloads. We built a GRuB prototype functional with Ethereum and Google LevelDB, and supported real applications in stablecoins. Under real workloads collected from the Ethereum contract-call history and mixed workloads of YCSB, we systematically evaluate GRuB's cost which shows a saving of Gas by 10% ~ 74%, with comparison to the baselines of static data-placement.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin is the first successful decentralized global digital cash system. Its mining process requires intense computational resources, therefore its usefulness remains a disputable topic. We aim to solve three problems with Bitcoin and other blockchain systems of today by repurposing their work. First, space to store a blockchain is growing linearly with number of transactions. Second, a honest node is forced to be irrational regarding storing full blocks by a way implementations are done. Third, a trustless bootstrapping process for a new node involves downloading and processing all the transactions ever written into a blockchain. In this paper we present a new consensus protocol for Bitcoin-like peer-to-peer systems where a right to generate a block is given to a party providing non-interactive proofs of storing a subset of the past state snapshots. Unlike the blockchain systems in use today, a network using our protocol is safe if the nodes prune full blocks not needed for mining. We extend the GKL model to describe our Proof-of-Work scheme and a transactional model modifications needed for it. We provide a detailed analysis of our protocol and proofs of its security.",

We implement a unique ring signature (URS) scheme using secp256k1, creating the first implementation compatible with blockchain libraries in this way, so as for easy implementation as an Ethereum smart contract.

Recent efforts to address performance and scale blockchains have focused on off-chain payment channels. While such channels can achieve low latency and high throughput, deploying them securely on top of the Bitcoin blockchain has been difficult, partly because building a secure implementation requires changes to the underlying protocol and the ecosystem. We present Teechan, a full-duplex payment channel framework that exploits trusted execution environments. Teechan can be deployed securely on the existing Bitcoin blockchain without having to modify the protocol. It: (i) achieves a higher transaction throughput and lower transaction latency than prior solutions; (ii) enables unlimited full-duplex payments as long as the balance does not exceed the channel's credit; (iii) requires only a single message to be sent per payment in any direction; and (iv) places at most two transactions on the blockchain under any execution scenario. We have built and deployed the Teechan framework using Intel SGX on the Bitcoin network. Our experiments show that, not counting network latencies, Teechan can achieve 2,480 transactions per second on a single channel, with sub-millisecond latencies.",

Our second attack shows that if the tracker is able to link two purchases of the same user to the blockchain in this manner, it can identify the user's entire cluster of addresses and transactions on the blockchain, even if the user employs blockchain anonymity techniques such as CoinJoin. The attacks are passive and hence can be retroactively applied to past purchases. We discuss several mitigations, but none are perfect.",

The attractive properties of smart contracts facilitate distributed data vending, allowing for proprietary data to be securely exchanged on a blockchain. Distributed data vending can transform domains such as healthcare by encouraging data distribution from owners and enabling large-scale data aggregation. However, one key challenge in distributed data vending is the trade-off dilemma between the effectiveness of data retrieval, and the leakage risk from indexing the data. In this paper, we propose a framework for distributed data vending through a combination of data embedding and similarity learning. We illustrate our framework through a practical scenario of distributing and aggregating electronic medical records on a blockchain.

We explain that in some situations a centralised approach that does not rely on blockchain is a better alternative due to its simplicity, scalability, and performance. We suggest that in applications where decentralisation and transparency are essential, developers can advantageously combine the two approaches into hybrid solutions where some operations are enforced by enforcers deployed on--blockchains and the rest by enforcers deployed on trusted third parties.",

In this paper, we propose DKSAP-IoT, a faster dual-key stealth address protocol for blockchain-based IoT systems. DKSAP-IoT utilizes a technique similar to the TLS session resumption to improve the performance and reduce the transaction size at the same time between two communication peers. Our theoretical analysis as well as the extensive experiments on an embedded computing platform demonstrate that DKSAP-IoT is able to reduce the computational overhead by at least 50% when compared to the state-of-the-art scheme, thereby paving the way for its application to blockchain-based IoT systems.",

Each data structurestructure -- indeed, each block -- specifies its own availability and integrity properties, allowing Charlotte applications to retain the full benefits of permissioned or permissionless blockchains. In Charlotte, a block can be atomically appended to multiple logs, allowing applications to be interoperable when they want to, without inefficiently forcing all applications to share one big log. We call this open graph of interconnected blocks a blockweb. We allow new kinds of blockweb applications that operate beyond traditional chains. We demonstrate the viability of Charlotte applications with proof-of-concept servers running interoperable blockchains. Using performance data from our prototype, we estimate that when compared with traditional blockchains, Charlotte offers multiple orders of magnitude improvement in speed and energy efficiency.",

We implement Bitcoin-NG and perform large-scale experiments at 15% the size of the operational Bitcoin system, using unchanged clients of both protocols.

All nodes validate the information to be appended to the blockchain, and a consensus protocol ensures that the nodes agree on a unique order in which entries are appended. Consensus protocols for tolerating Byzantine faults have received renewed attention because they also address blockchain systems. This work discusses the process of assessing and gaining confidence in the resilience of a consensus protocols exposed to faults and adversarial nodes. We advocate to follow the established practice in cryptography and computer security, relying on public reviews, detailed models, and formal proofs; the designers of several practical systems appear to be unaware of this. Moreover, we review the consensus protocols in some prominent permissioned blockchain platforms with respect to their fault models and resilience against attacks. The protocol comparison covers Hyperledger Fabric, Tendermint, Symbiont, R3~Corda, Iroha, Kadena, Chain, Quorum, MultiChain, Sawtooth Lake, Ripple, Stellar, and IOTA.",

    "abstract": "At the heart of the Bitcoin is a blockchain protocol, a protocol for achieving consensus on a public ledger that records bitcoin transactions. To the extent that a blockchain protocol is used for applications such as contract signing and making certain transactions (such as house sales) public, we need to understand what guarantees the protocol gives us in terms of agents' knowledge. Here, we provide a complete characterization of agent's knowledge when running a blockchain protocol using a variant of common knowledge that takes into account the fact that agents can enter and leave the system, it is not known which agents are in fact following the protocol (some agents may want to deviate if they can gain by doing so), and the fact that the guarantees provided by blockchain protocols are probabilistic. We then consider some scenarios involving contracts and show that this level of knowledge suffices for some scenarios, but not others.",

However, running the mining process may cost too much energy consumption and computing resource usage on handheld devices, which restricts the use of blockchain in mobile environments. In this paper, we consider deploying edge computing service to support the mobile blockchain. We propose an auction-based edge computing resource market of the edge computing service provider. Since there is competition among miners, the allocative externalities (positive and negative) are taken into account in the model. In our auction mechanism, we maximize the social welfare while guaranteeing the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Based on blockchain mining experiment results, we define a hash power function that characterizes the probability of successfully mining a block. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of our auction mechanism which shows that our edge computing resources market model can efficiently solve the social welfare maximization problem for the edge computing service provider.",

However, the blockchain technology has not been adopted and implemented widely in m-commerce because its mining processes usually require to be performed on standard computing units, e.g., computers. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a new m-commerce application using blockchain technology, namely, MobiChain, to secure transactions in the m-commerce.

Bitcoin miners work individually to solve a computationally intensive problem, and with each solution a Bitcoin block is generated, resulting in a new arrival to the blockchain. The difficulty of the computational problem is updated every 2,016 blocks in order to control the rate at which blocks are generated. In the original Bitcoin paper, it was suggested that the blockchain arrivals occur according to a homogeneous Poisson process. Based on blockchain block arrival data and stochastic analysis of the block arrival process, we demonstrate that this is not the case. We present a refined mathematical model for block arrivals, focusing on both the block arrivals during a period of constant difficulty and how the difficulty level evolves over time.",

In the market, the cache helpers are able to autonomously adapt their caching strategies according to the market statistics obtained from the blockchain, and the truthfulness of trustless nodes are financially enforced by smart contract terms. Further, we propose an incentive-compatible consensus mechanism based on proof-of-stake to financially encourage the cache helpers to stay active in service. We model the interaction between the cache helpers and the content providers as a Chinese restaurant game. Based on the theoretical analysis regarding the Nash equilibrium of the game, we propose a decentralized strategy-searching algorithm using sequential best response.

Firstly, the paper analyzes distributed ledger technology with an emphasis on the features relevant to distributed systems. Secondly, the paper analyses the usage of directed acyclic graph paradigm in the context of distributed ledgers, and compares it with the blockchain-based solutions. The two paradigms are compared using representative implementations: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Nano. We examine representative solutions in terms of the applied data structures for maintaining the ledger, consensus mechanisms, transaction confirmation confidence, ledger size, and scalability.",

BAD enjoys the following features: (i) it is distributed (thus avoiding any central point of failure), (ii) it is tamper-proof (making not possible for a malicious software to remove or to alter its own traces), (iii) it is trusted (any behavioral data is collected and verified by the majority of the network) and (iv) it is private (avoiding any third party to collect/analyze/store sensitive information).

    "abstract": "Permissioned blockchains promise secure decentralized data management in business-to-business use-cases. In contrast to Bitcoin and similar public blockchains which rely on Proof-of-Work for consensus and are deployed on thousands of geo-distributed nodes, business-to-business use-cases (such as supply chain management and banking) require significantly fewer nodes, cheaper consensus, and are often deployed in datacenter-like environments with fast networking. However, permissioned blockchains often follow the architectural thinkining behind their WAN-oriented public relatives, which results in end-to-end latencies several orders of magnitude higher than necessary. In this work, we propose StreamChain, a permissioned blockchain design that eliminates blocks in favor of processing transactions in a streaming fashion. This results in a drastically lower latency without reducing throughput or forfeiting reliability and security guarantees. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our design, we prototype StreamChain based on the Hyperledger Fabric, and show that it delivers latency two orders of magnitude lower than Fabric, while sustaining similar throughput. This performance makes StreamChain a potential alternative to traditional databases and, thanks to its streaming paradigm, enables further research around reducing latency through relying on modern hardware in datacenters.",

Sharing health data is considered to be a critical approach to improve the quality of healthcare service and reduce medical costs. However, EMRs are fragmented across decentralized hospitals, which hinders data sharing and puts patients' privacy at risks. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for EMRs, called BPDS. In BPDS, the original EMRs are stored securely in the cloud and the indexes are reserved in a tamper-proof consortium blockchain. By this means, the risk of the medical data leakage could be greatly reduced, and at the same time, the indexes in blockchain ensure that the EMRs can not be modified arbitrarily. Secure data sharing can be accomplished automatically according to the predefined access permissions of patients through the smart contracts of blockchain. Besides, the joint-design of the CP-ABE-based access control mechanism and the content extraction signature scheme provides strong privacy preservation in data sharing. Security analysis shows that BPDS is a secure and effective way to realize data sharing for EMRs.",

    "abstract": "In Bitcoin, to independently verify whether new transactions are correct or not, a type of a node called \"Full Node\" has to hold the whole of historical transactions. The transactions are stored in ledger called \"Blockchain. \" Blockchain is an append-only data structure. Thus, to operate Full Nodes, the required storage capacity would grow too large for resource-constrained devices. Due to the limitation, the existing lightweight node scheme is that a node relies on other Full Nodes. In this thesis, to reduce storage capacity with keeping the independence of each node, we propose a storage load balancing scheme \"KARAKASA\" using Distributed Hash Table (DHT). In KARAKASA, nodes distributedly keep the whole blockchain among DHT networked nodes. We evaluated KARAKASA from the view of storage capacity and independence. As a result, a node in a cluster does not need to trust other nodes. We concluded that nodes in a DHT cluster can behave like Full Nodes without holding the whole blockchain.",

This demo paper presents a lightweight single-node emulator of blockchain systems, namely \\mbox{BlockLite}, designed to be executing real proof-of-work workload along with peer-to-peer network communications and hash-based immutability. BlockLite employs a preprocessing approach to avoid the per-node computation overhead at runtime and thus scales to thousands of nodes.

This article starts from introducing the basic concept of blockchain and illustrating why consensus mechanism plays an indispensable role in a blockchain enabled IoT system. Then, we discuss the main ideas of two famous consensus mechanisms including Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), and list their limitations in IoT. Next, two mainstream Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) based consensus mechanisms, i.e., the Tangle and Hashgraph, are reviewed to show why DAG consensus is more suitable for IoT system than PoW and PoS. Potential issues and challenges of DAG based consensus mechanism to be addressed in the future are discussed in the last.",

We use three low-power systems to represent a wide range of the performance-power spectrum, while covering both x86/64 and ARM architectures. We show that low-end wimpy nodes are struggling to run full-fledged blockchains mainly due to their small and low-bandwidth memory. On the other hand, wimpy systems with balanced performance-to-power ratio achieve reasonable performance while saving significant amounts of energy. For example, Jetson TX2 nodes achieve around 80% and 30% of the throughput of Parity and Hyperledger, respectively, while using 18x and 23x less energy compared to traditional brawny servers with Intel Xeon CPU.",

In this study, we aim to shorten the block generation interval without increasing the fork generation rate by improving the network topology of the nodes and shortening the propagation time. We propose a neighbor node selection method forming a network topology with a short block propagation time. A blockchain simulator is used to demonstrate the effect of the proposed neighbor node selection method on the propagation delay of the network. This result indicates that the proposed method improves block propagation time.",

Hyperledger fabric, which is a blockchain platform developed as part of the Hyperledger project, though looks very apt for IoT applications, has comparatively low tolerance for malicious activities in an untrustworthy environment. To that end, we propose AI-enabled blockchain (AIBC) with a 2-step consensus protocol that uses an outlier detection algorithm for consensus in an IoT network implemented on hyperledger fabric platform. The outlier-aware consensus protocol exploits a supervised machine learning algorithm which detects anomaly activities via a learned detector in the first step. Then, the data goes through the inherent Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocol in the hyperledger fabric for ledger update. We measure and report the performance of our framework with respect to the various delay components. Results reveal that our implemented AIBC network (2-step consensus protocol) improves hyperledger fabric performance in terms of fault tolerance by marginally compromising the delay performance.",

Lightning Network (LN) is one of the supporting technologies developed to eliminate this impediment of blockchain technology by facilitating instantaneous transfers of cryptos.

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies, implemented with blockchain protocols, promise to become a global payment system if they can overcome performance limitations. Rapidly advancing architectures improve on latency and throughput, but most require all participating servers to process all transactions. Several recent works propose to shard the system, such that each machine would only process a subset of the transactions. However, we identify a denial-of-service attack that is exposed by these solutions - an attacker can generate transactions that would overload a single shard, thus delaying processing in the entire system. Moreover, we show that in common scenarios, these protocols require most node operators to process almost all blockchain transactions. We present Ostraka, a blockchain node architecture that shards (parallelizes) the nodes themselves. We prove that replacing a unified node with an Ostraka node does not affect the security of the underlying consensus mechanism. We evaluate analytically and experimentally block propagation and processing in various settings. Ostraka allows nodes in the network to scale, without costly coordination. In our experiments, Ostraka nodes' transaction processing rate grows linearly with the addition of resources.",

At the same time this research is challenging fundamental aspects of the Bitcoin core concept. It has to be questioned whether all of these new approaches still adequately could be described as blockchain technology. We propose to use the term Decentralized Consensus Technology as a general category instead. Decentralized Consensus Technology consists of decentralized ledger and non-ledger technologies. Blockchain technology in turn is only one of multiple implementations of the Decentralized Ledger Technology. Furthermore, we identified three main characteristics of Decentralized Consensus Technology: decentralization, trustlessness and ability to eventually reach consensus. Depending on the use case of the specific implementation the following additional properties have to be considered: privacy, participation incentive, irreversibility and immutability, operation purpose, confirmation time, transaction costs, ability to externalize transactions and computations and scalability possibilities.",

The marketplace is implemented on a permissioned blockchain infrastructure, where bids are stored to the immutable ledger and smart contracts are used to implement the MCP calculation and award service contracts to all winning bids. Utilizing the blockchain obviates the need for a trusted, centralized auctioneer, and eliminates vulnerability to a single point of failure. Simulation results show that the platform enables a community peak demand reduction of 46%, as well as a weekly savings of 6%. The platform is also tested at a real-world Canadian microgrid using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework, to show the end to end connectivity of smart home DERs to the platform.",

The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which is unavailable. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void.

In this paper we apply supervised learning techniques to detect fraudulent accounts on Ethereum blockchain. We compare capabilities of Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and XGBoost classifiers to identify such accounts basing on a dataset of more than 300 thousands accounts. Results show that we are able to achieve recall and precision values allowing for the designed system to be applicable as an anti-fraud rule for digital wallets or currency exchanges.

SharPer supports both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions and processes intra-shard transactions of different clusters as well as cross-shard transactions with non-overlapping clusters simultaneously. In SharPer, the blockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph where each cluster maintains only a view of the ledger. SharPer also incorporates a flattened protocol to establish consensus among clusters on the order of cross-shard transactions. The experimental results reveal the efficiency of SharPer in terms of performance and scalability especially in workloads with a low percentage of cross-shard transactions.",

In this paper a number of blockchain applications aimed at supporting initiatives for common good are highlighted. This is followed by a discussion on technology de/centralisation and a thought experiment used to raise questions regarding the use of decentralised technology in terms of social implications.",

    "abstract": "Hyperledger Fabric is a distributed operating system for permissioned blockchains hosted by the Linux Foundation. It is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications at enterprise grade scale. To achieve this, Hyperledger Fabric introduces a novel execute-order-validate blockchain architecture, allowing parallelization of transaction execution and validation. However, this raises the need for transaction isolation. Today transaction isolation is attained by locking the entire state database during simulation of transactions and database updates. This lock is one of the major performance bottlenecks as observed by previous work. This work presents a new lock-free approach for providing transaction isolation. It harnesses the already existing versioning of key-value pairs in the database, used primarily for a read-write conflict detection during the validation phase, to create a version-based snapshot isolation. We further implement and evaluate our new approach. We show that our solution outperforms the current implementation by 8.1x and that it is comparable to the optimal solution where no isolation mechanism is applied.",

Here, we analyze the recent blockchain techniques and demonstrate that the potential of widely-adopted consensus-based scaling is seriously limited, especially in the current era when Moore's law-based hardware scaling is about to end. We achieve this by developing an open-source benchmarking tool, called Prism, for investigating the key factors causing low resource efficiency and then discuss various topology and hardware innovations which could help to scale up blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study that explores the next-generation scaling strategies by conducting large-scale and comprehensive benchmarking.",

Although blockchains have the potential to provide various services for high-performance computing (HPC) systems, HPC will not be able to embrace blockchains before the following two missing pieces become available: (i) new consensus protocols being aware of the shared-storage architecture in HPC, and (ii) new fault-tolerant mechanisms compensating for HPC's programming model---the message passing interface (MPI)---that is vulnerable for blockchain-like workloads. To this end, we design a new set of consensus protocols crafted for the HPC platforms and a new fault-tolerance subsystem compensating for the failures caused by faulty MPI processes. Built on top of the new protocols and fault-tolerance mechanism, a prototype system is implemented and evaluated with two million transactions on a 500-core HPC cluster, showing $6\\times$, $12\\times$, and $75\\times$ higher throughput than Hyperldeger, Ethereum, and Parity, respectively.",

In an IoT setting, improving and scaling network components as well as reducing cost is essential to sustain exponential growth. In this domain, software-defined networking (SDN) is revolutionizing the network infrastructure with a new paradigm. SDN splits the control/routing logic from the data transfer/forwarding. This splitting causes many issues in SDN, such as vulnerabilities of DDoS attacks. Many solutions (including blockchain based) have been proposed to overcome these problems. In this work, we offer a blockchain-based solution that is provided in redundant SDN (load-balanced) to service millions of IoT devices. Blockchain is considered as tamper-proof and impossible to corrupt due to the replication of the ledger and consensus for verification and addition to the ledger. Therefore, it is a perfect fit for SDN in IoT Networks. Blockchain technology provides everyone with a working proof of decentralized trust. The experimental results show gain and efficiency with respect to the accuracy, update process, and bandwidth utilization.",

Despite the significantly improved scalability claimed by several high--profile blockchain projects, there has been little effort to understand how their transactional throughput is being used. In this paper, we examine recent network traffic of three major high-scalability blockchains--EOSIO, Tezos and XRP Ledger (XRPL)--over a period of seven months. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of the transactions are used for value transfer purposes. In particular, 96% of the transactions on EOSIO were triggered by the airdrop of a currently valueless token; on Tezos, 76% of throughput was used for maintaining consensus; and over 94% of transactions on XRPL carried no economic value. We also identify a persisting airdrop on EOSIO as a DoS attack and detect a two-month-long spam attack on XRPL. The paper explores the different designs of the three blockchains and sheds light on how they could shape user behavior.",

    "abstract": "Unlike cryptocurrency transactions in bitcoin that are stored indefinitely, the data of certain applications like IoT have finite-lifetime. In this context, one of the recent research works proposed LiTiChain - a new architecture for Blockchain of finite-lifetime blocks with applications to Edge-IoT. The novelty of LiTiChain lies in ensuring the connectivity of the chain even after the expired blocks are deleted from the chain. To provide the same level of security as conventional blockchain, in LiTiChain, some blocks are stored longer than their lifetime, which incurs additional storage cost. This paper presents two new blockchain architectures i.e. p-LiTiChain and s-LiTiChain that are variants of LiTiChain. The proposed architectures offer a degree of freedom in the design of blockchain of finite-lifetime blocks in terms of a tradeoff between storage cost, security and computational cost. With extensive simulations and analysis, it is demonstrated that the proposed architectures have the potential to decrease the additional storage cost incurred by LiTiChain to zero and improve security at the expense of computational cost.",

In fact, despite the large research and experimental effort, all known approaches turn out to be tradeoffs. We theoretically describe a new blockchain architecture that scales to arbitrarily high workload provided that a corresponding proportional increment of nodes is provisioned. We show that, under reasonable assumptions, our approach does not require tradeoffs on security or decentralization.

We analyze the tradeoff between communication reliability and computing power in blockchain security, and present a lower bound to the computing power that is needed to conduct an attack with a given communication reliability.

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, there has been a growth in activity, public knowledge, and awareness of cryptocurrencies and related blockchain technology. As the industry has grown, there has also been an increase in scams looking to steal unsuspecting individuals cryptocurrency. Many of the scams operate on visually similar but seemingly unconnected websites, advertised by malicious social media accounts, which either attempt an advance-fee scam or operate as phishing websites. This paper analyses public online and blockchain-based data to provide a deeper understanding of these cryptocurrency scams. The clustering technique DBSCAN is applied to the content of scam websites to discover a typology of advance-fee and phishing scams. It is found that the same entities are running multiple instances of similar scams, revealed by their online infrastructure and blockchain activity. The entities also manufacture public blockchain activity to create the appearance that their scams are genuine. Through source and destination of funds analysis, it is observed that victims usually send funds from fiat-accepting exchanges. The entities running these scams cash-out or launder their proceeds using a variety of avenues including exchanges, gambling sites, and mixers.",

    "abstract": "As the pioneer of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency to date. Given its dramatic price spikes (and crashes) along with the never-ending news from SEC regulations to security breaches, there seems to be a lack of understanding about the dynamics of cryptocurrencies. These dynamics are believed to be affected by various political, security, financial, and regulatory events. In this paper, we present an efficient framework for holistic analysis of cryptocurrency fluctuations by introducing the Impact-Score metric to distinguish event-induced changes from normal variations. We have applied our framework to 16 major worldwide events and the Bitcoin blockchain network (defined as Bitcoin transaction and users, blockchain data, and memory pool data) from 2016-2018. The results show that a majority of the events are correlated with substantial network changes. We observed roughly generalizable correlations between event types (e.g. financial events) and sub-structures of the Bitcoin blockchain network. Subgroups of these events have strongly consistent temporal impacts on specific facets (e.g. activity or fees) of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our process by correlating a majority of spikes in network/subnetwork change with major events.",

However, it still has limitations for datasets with frequent queries, such as the fast accumulation of privacy cost. To tackle this limitation, this paper explores the integration of a secured decentralised ledger, blockchain. Blockchain will be able to keep track of all noisy responses generated with differential privacy algorithm and allow for certain queries to reuse old responses. In this paper, a demo of a proposed blockchain-based privacy management system is designed as an interactive decentralised web application (DApp). The demo created illustrates that leveraging on blockchain will allow the total privacy cost accumulated to decrease significantly.",

In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for blockchain consensus protocols termed as AlphaBlock. In this framework, we compare the overall performance of Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus and Nakamoto Consensus (NC). BFT consensus is reached by multiple rounds of quorum votes from the supermajority, while NC is reached by accumulating credibility with the implicit voting from appending blocks. AlphaBlock incorporates the key concepts of Hotstu BFT (HBFT) and Proof-of-authority (PoA) as the case study of BFT and NC. Using this framework, we compare the throughput and latency of HBFT and PoA with practical network and blockchain configurations. Our results show that the performance of HBFT dominates PoA in most scenarios due to the absence of forks in HBFT. Moreover, we find out a set of optimal configurations in AlphaBlock, which sheds a light for improving the performance of blockchain consensus algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has evolved into a platform for decentralized applications, with beneficial properties like high integrity, transparency, and resilience against censorship and tampering. However, blockchains are closed-world systems which do not have access to external state. To overcome this limitation, oracles have been introduced in various forms and for different purposes. However so far common oracle best practices have not been dissected, classified, and studied in their fundamental aspects. In this paper, we address this gap by studying foundational blockchain oracle patterns in two foundational dimensions characterising the oracles: (i) the data flow direction, i.e., inbound and outbound data flow, from the viewpoint of the blockchain; and (ii) the initiator of the data flow, i.e., whether it is push or pull-based communication. We provide a structured description of the four patterns in detail, and discuss an implementation of these patterns based on use cases. On this basis we conduct a quantitative analysis, which results in the insight that the four different patterns are characterized by distinct performance and costs profiles.",

Existing approaches support a large set of patterns, modeling languages, and blockchain architectures, which cover a wide range of practical scenarios. However, they largely neglect the important aspect of time, a crucial part of process and choreography models manifested in deadlines, delays, and other temporal constraints. We argue that this deficit is due to inherent limitations of smart contracts---in particular the absence of a natural notion of measuring time---on popular blockchain platforms used in research and practice. We introduce a set of time measures available on blockchain platforms to alleviate these issues, and systematically compare their properties. We also give hints as to their suitability for facilitating various temporal constraints commonly found in process models.",

This study introduces a new online cryptocurrency transaction data viewing tool called SilkViser. Guided by detailed scenario and requirement analyses, we create a series of appreciating visualization designs, such as paper ledger-inspired block and blockchain visualizations and ancient copper coin-inspired transaction visualizations, to help users understand cryptocurrency transaction mechanisms and recognize advanced transaction information. We also provide a set of lightweight interactions to facilitate easy and free data exploration. Moreover, a controlled user study is conducted to quantitatively evaluate the usability and effectiveness of SilkViser. Results indicate that SilkViser can satisfy the requirements of NUsers and EUsers. Our visualization designs can compensate for the inexperience of NUsers in data viewing and attract potential users to participate in cryptocurrency transactions.",

The size of the bitcoin blockchain is growing linearly with transactions. We propose a new block structure to represent the state of a blockchain also called UTXO set by including an accumulator of a state in the block header and proofs of knowledge for inclusion and deletion of the transactions of the current block in the block. In our scheme, the miners periodically release a snapshot of the blockchain state. The other full nodes in the network, securely prune the historical blocks after attaining the required number of confirmations for the snapshot block, which in turn confirms the snapshot of the state through an accumulator specified in the block header and proofs inside the block. The secure and periodic pruning of the old blocks, reduce the synchronization time for a new node joining into the network. The simulation results demonstrate a significant reduction in the storage space of a full node and bootstrapping cost of the new nodes.",

A profile of how a user performs transactions is built overtime and is used to analyse the risk level of each new transaction. If a transaction is flagged as high risk, we generate n-factor layers of authentication using past endorsed blockchain transactions. A demonstration of how we used the proposed approach to authenticate critical financial transactions in a blockchain-based asset financing platform is also discussed.",

Specifically, we develop a novel blockchain-based transactive energy framework for prosumers and design a decentralized energy trading algorithm that matches the operation of the underlying blockchain system. We prove that the trading algorithm improves the individual benefit and guarantees the socially optimal performance, and thus incentivizes prosumers to join the transactive energy platform. Moreover, we evaluate the feasibility of the transactive energy platform throughout the implementation of a small-scale network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and extensive simulations using real-world data. Our results show that this blockchain-based transactive energy platform is feasible in practice, and the decentralized trading algorithm reduces the user's individual cost by up to 77% and lowers the overall cost by 24%.",

The recent introduction of error correcting codes in sharded blockchain by Li et al. partially settles this trilemma, boosting throughput without compromising security and decentralization. In this paper, we improve the coded sharding scheme in three ways. First, we propose a novel 2-Dimensional Sharding strategy, which inherently supports cross-shard transactions, alleviating the need for complicated inter-shard communication protocols. Second, we employ distributed storage techniques in the propagation of blocks, improving latency under restricted bandwidth. Finally, we incorporate polynomial cryptographic primitives of low degree, which brings coded blockchain techniques into the realm of feasible real-world parameters.",

Finally, in the third step evidence is received within minutes via a public blockchain.",

Modern blockchains feature services such as name registration and smart contracts. Some employ new forms of consensus, such as proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work. However, these blockchains are so far relatively poorly investigated, despite the fact that they move considerable assets. In this paper, we explore three representative, modern blockchains---Ethereum, Namecoin, and Peercoin. Our focus is on the features that set them apart from the pure currency use case of Bitcoin. We investigate the blockchains' activity in terms of transactions and usage patterns, identifying some curiosities in the process. For Ethereum, we are mostly interested in the smart contract functionality it offers. We also carry out a brief analysis of issues that are introduced by negligent design of smart contracts. In the case of Namecoin, our focus is how the name registration is used and has developed over time. For Peercoin, we are interested in the use of proof-of-stake, as this consensus algorithm is poorly understood yet used to move considerable value. Finally, we relate the above to the fundamental characteristics of the underlying peer-to-peer networks. We present a crawler for Ethereum and give statistics on the network size. For Peercoin and Namecoin, we identify the relatively small size of the networks and the weak bootstrapping process.",

We illustrate this approach with a use case in which blockchains record hashes of financial process transactions to increase their trustworthiness and that of their audits. For Proof of Work as cryptographic puzzle, we develop a detailed mathematical model to derive MINLP optimization problems for computing optimal Proof of Work configuration parameters that trade off potentially conflicting aspects such as availability, resiliency, security, and cost in this governed setting. We demonstrate the utility of such a mining calculus by solving some instances of this problem. This experimental validation is strengthened by statistical experiments that confirm the validity of random variables used in formulating our mathematical model.

To address the grain quality measurement challenge through the transportation chain, novel technologies, such as Distributed Ledger and Blockchain, can bring more efficiency and resilience to the process. Particularly, Blockchain is a new type of distributed database in which transactions are securely appended using cryptography and hashed pointers. Those transactions can be generated and ruled by special network-embedded software -- known as smart contracts -- that may be public to all nodes of the network or may be private to a specific set of peer nodes. This paper analyses the implementation of Blockchain technology targeting grain quality assurance tracking in a real scenario.

    "abstract": "The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is facing significant scalability and security challenges. On the one hand, IoT devices are \"weak\" and need external assistance. Edge computing provides a promising direction addressing the deficiency of centralized cloud computing in scaling massive number of devices. On the other hand, IoT devices are also relatively \"vulnerable\" facing malicious hackers due to resource constraints. The emerging blockchain and smart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT and edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and prototype an edge-IoT framework named \"EdgeChain\" based on blockchain and smart contracts. The core idea is to integrate a permissioned blockchain and the internal currency or \"coin\" system to link the edge cloud resource pool with each IoT device' account and resource usage, and hence behavior of the IoT devices. EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control how much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on pre-defined rules on priority, application types and past behaviors. Smart contracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device behavior in a non-deniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and transactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ideas. The results show that while gaining the security benefits of blockchain and smart contracts, the cost of integrating them into EdgeChain is within a reasonable and acceptable range.",

Any transaction ever completed is recorded in a public ledger in a verifiable and permanent way. Based on blockchain technology, we propose a global higher education credit platform, named EduCTX. This platform is based on the concept of the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). It constitutes a globally trusted, decentralized higher education credit and grading system that can offer a globally unified viewpoint for students and higher education institutions (HEIs), as well as for other potential stakeholders such as companies, institutions, and organizations. As a proof of concept, we present a prototype implementation of the environment, based on the open-source Ark Blockchain Platform. Based on a globally distributed peer-to-peer network, EduCTX will process, manage and control ECTX tokens, which represent credits that students gain for completed courses such as ECTS. HEIs are the peers of the blockchain network. The platform is a first step towards a more transparent and technologically advanced form of higher education systems. The EduCTX platform represents the basis of the EduCTX initiative which anticipates that various HEIs would join forces in order to create a globally efficient, simplified and ubiquitous environment in order to avoid language and administrative barriers. Therefore we invite and encourage HEIs to join the EduCTX initiative and the EduCTX blockchain network.",

In a blockchain network, the states of the accounts are stored and updated by the validator nodes, interconnected in a peer-to-peer fashion. IoT devices are characterized by relatively low computing capabilities and low power consumption, as well as sporadic and low-bandwidth wireless connectivity. An IoT device connects to one or more validator nodes to observe or modify the state of the accounts. In order to interact with the most recent state of accounts, a device needs to be synchronized with the blockchain copy stored by the validator nodes. In this work, we describe general architectures and synchronization protocols that enable synchronization of the IoT endpoints to the blockchain, with different communication costs and security levels. We model and analytically characterize the traffic generated by the synchronization protocols, and also investigate the power consumption and synchronization trade-off via numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that rigorously models the role of wireless connectivity in blockchain-powered IoT systems.",

Guaranteeing security and protocol conformity through its elegant combination of cryptographic assurances and game theoretic economic incentives, it permits censorship resistant public read-write access to its append-only blockchain database without the need for any mediating central authority. Not until its advent has such a trusted, transparent, comprehensive and granular data set of digital economic behaviours been available for public network analysis. In this article, by translating the cumbersome binary data structure of the Bitcoin blockchain into a high fidelity graph model, we demonstrate through various analyses the often overlooked social and econometric benefits of employing such a novel open data architecture. Specifically we show (a) how repeated patterns of transaction behaviours can be revealed to link user activity across the blockchain; (b) how newly mined bitcoin can be associated to demonstrate individual accumulations of wealth; (c) through application of the naive quantity theory of money that Bitcoin's disinflationary properties can be revealed and measured; and (d) how the user community can develop coordinated defences against repeated denial of service attacks on the network. All of the aforementioned being exemplary benefits that would be lost with the closed data models of the 'private permissioned' distributed ledger architectures that are dominating enterprise level development due to existing blockchain issues of governance, scalability and confidentiality.",

    "abstract": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Supply Chain monitoring applications rely on messaging protocols for exchanging data. Contemporary IoT deployments widely use the publish-subscribe messaging model because of its resource-efficiency. However, the systems with publish-subscribe messaging model employ a centralized architecture, wherein the data from all the devices in the application network flows via a central broker to the subscribers. Such a centralized architecture make publish-subscribe messaging model susceptible to a central point of failure. Besides, it provides an opportunity for the organization that owns the broker to tamper with the data. In this work, we contribute Trinity, a novel distributed publish-subscribe broker with blockchain-based immutability. Trinity distributes the data published to one of the brokers in the network to all the brokers in the network. The distributed data is stored in an immutable ledger through the use of the blockchain technology. Furthermore, Trinity executes smart contracts to validate the data before saving the data on the blockchain. Through the use of a blockchain network, Trinity can guarantee persistence, ordering, and immutability across trust boundaries. Our evaluation results show that Trinity consumes minimal resources, and the use of smart contracts enable the stakeholders to automate the data management processes. To the best of our knowledge, Trinity is the first framework that combines the components of the blockchain technology with the publish-subscribe messaging model.",

Trusted entities called oracles attest to external data in order to bring it onto the blockchain but they do so without the robust security guarantees that blockchains generally provide. This has the potential to turn oracles into centralized points-of-failure. To address this concern, this paper introduces Astraea, a decentralized oracle based on a voting game that decides the truth or falsity of propositions. Players fall into two roles: voters and certifiers. Voters play a low-risk/low-reward role that is resistant to adversarial manipulation while certifiers play a high-risk/high-reward role so they are required to play with a high degree of accuracy. This paper also presents a formal analysis of the parameters behind the system to measure the probability of an adversary with bounded funds being able to successfully manipulate the oracle's decision, that shows that the same parameters can be set to make manipulation arbitrarily difficult---a desirable feature for the system. Further, this analysis demonstrates that under those conditions a Nash equilibrium exists where all rational players are forced to behave honestly.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, allow a set of actors to maintain a ledger of transactions without relying on a central authority and to deploy scripts, called smart contracts, that are executed whenever certain transactions occur. These features can be used as basic building blocks for executing collaborative business processes between mutually untrusting parties. However, implementing business processes using the low-level primitives provided by blockchain platforms is cumbersome and error-prone. In contrast, established business process management systems, such as those based on the standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), provide convenient abstractions for rapid development of process-oriented applications. This article demonstrates how to combine the advantages of a business process management system with those of a blockchain platform. The article introduces a blockchain-based BPMN execution engine, namely Caterpillar. Like any BPMN execution engine, Caterpillar supports the creation of instances of a process model and allows users to monitor the state of process instances and to execute tasks thereof. The specificity of Caterpillar is that the state of each process instance is maintained on the (Ethereum) blockchain and the workflow routing is performed by smart contracts generated by a BPMN-to-Solidity compiler. The Caterpillar compiler supports a large array of BPMN constructs, including subprocesses, multi-instances activities and event handlers. The paper describes the architecture of Caterpillar, and the interfaces it provides to support the monitoring of process instances, the allocation and execution of work items, and the execution of service tasks.",

    "abstract": "Today's blockchain designs suffer from a trilemma claiming that no blockchain system can simultaneously achieve decentralization, security, and performance scalability. For current blockchain systems, as more nodes join the network, the efficiency of the system (computation, communication, and storage) stays constant at best. A leading idea for enabling blockchains to scale efficiency is the notion of sharding: different subsets of nodes handle different portions of the blockchain, thereby reducing the load for each individual node. However, existing sharding proposals achieve efficiency scaling by compromising on trust - corrupting the nodes in a given shard will lead to the permanent loss of the corresponding portion of data. In this paper, we settle the trilemma by demonstrating a new protocol for coded storage and computation in blockchains. In particular, we propose PolyShard: ``polynomially coded sharding'' scheme that achieves information-theoretic upper bounds on the efficiency of the storage, system throughput, as well as on trust, thus enabling a truly scalable system. We provide simulation results that numerically demonstrate the performance improvement over state of the arts, and the scalability of the PolyShard system. Finally, we discuss potential enhancements, and highlight practical considerations in building such a system.",

    "abstract": "This article surveys blockchain-based approaches for several security services. These services include authentication, confidentiality, privacy, and access control list (ACL), data and resource provenance, and integrity assurance. All these services are critical for the current distributed applications, especially due to the large amount of data being processed over the networks and the use of cloud computing. Authentication ensures that the user is who he/she claims to be. Confidentiality guarantees that data cannot be read by unauthorized users. Privacy provides the users the ability to control who can access their data. Provenance allows an efficient tracking of the data and resources along with their ownership and utilization over the network. Integrity helps in verifying that the data has not been modified or altered. These services are currently managed by centralized controllers, for example, a certificate authority. Therefore, the services are prone to attacks on the centralized controller. On the other hand, blockchain is a secured and distributed ledger that can help resolve many of the problems with centralization. The objectives of this paper are to give insights on the use of security services for current applications, to highlight the state of the art techniques that are currently used to provide these services, to describe their challenges, and to discuss how the blockchain technology can resolve these challenges. Further, several blockchain-based approaches providing such security services are compared thoroughly. Challenges associated with using blockchain-based security services are also discussed to spur further research in this area.",

    "abstract": "The various applications using Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) or blockchains, have led to the introduction of a new `marketplace' where multiple types of digital assets may be exchanged. As each blockchain is designed to support specific types of assets and transactions, and no blockchain will prevail, the need to perform interblockchain transactions is already pressing. In this work we examine the fundamental problem of interoperable and interconnected blockchains. In particular, we begin by introducing the Multi-Distributed Ledger Objects (MDLO), which is the result of aggregating multiple Distributed Ledger Objects -- DLO (a DLO is a formalization of the blockchain) and that supports append and get operations of records (e.g., transactions) in them from multiple clients concurrently. Next, we define the AtomicAppends problem, which emerges when the exchange of digital assets between multiple clients may involve appending records in more than one DLO. Specifically, AtomicAppend requires that either all records will be appended on the involved DLOs or none. We examine the solvability of this problem assuming rational and risk-averse clients that may fail by crashing, and under different client utility and append models, timing models, and client failure scenarios. We show that for some cases the existence of an intermediary is necessary for the problem solution. We propose the implementation of such intermediary over a specialized blockchain, we term Smart DLO (SDLO), and we show how this can be used to solve the AtomicAppends problem even in an asynchronous, client competitive environment, where all the clients may crash.",

Since the first success in financial sector, blockchain has shown great potentials in various domains, e.g., internet of things and mobile networks. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based architecture for content delivery networks (B-CDN), which exploits the advances of the blockchain technology to provide a decentralized and secure platform to connect content providers (CPs) with users. On one hand, the proposed B-CDN will leverage the registration and subscription of the users to different CPs, while guaranteeing the user privacy thanks to virtual identity provided by the blockchain network. On the other hand, the B-CDN creates a public immutable database of the requested contents (from all CPs), based on which each CP can better evaluate the user preference on its contents. The benefits of B-CDN are demonstrated via an edge-caching application, in which a feature-based caching algorithm is proposed for all CPs. The proposed caching algorithm is verified with the realistic Movielens dataset. A win-win relation between the CPs and users is observed, where the B-CDN improves user quality of experience and reduces cost of delivering content for the CPs.",

Under the hood, Blockchain technology is a type of distributed database that supports untrusted parties. In this paper we focus Hyperledger Fabric, the first blockchain in the market tailored for a private environment, allowing businesses to create a permissioned network. Hyperledger Fabric implements a PBFT consensus in order to maintain a non forking blockchain at the application level. We deployed this framework over an area network between France and Germany in order to evaluate its performance when potentially large network delays are observed. Overall we found that when network delay increases significantly (i.e. up to 3.5 seconds at network layer between two clouds), we observed that the blocks added to our blockchain had up to 134 seconds offset after 100 th block from one cloud to another. Thus by delaying block propagation, we demonstrated that Hyperledger Fabric does not provide sufficient consistency guaranties to be deployed in critical environments. Our work, is the fist to evidence the negative impact of network delays on a PBFT-based blockchain.",

    "abstract": "To participate in the distributed consensus of permissionless blockchains, prospective nodes -- or miners -- provide proof of designated, costly resources. However, in contrast to the intended decentralization, current data on blockchain mining unveils increased concentration of these resources in a few major entities, typically mining pools. To study strategic considerations in this setting, we employ the concept of Oceanic Games, Milnor and Shapley (1978). Oceanic Games have been used to analyze decision making in corporate settings with small numbers of dominant players (shareholders) and large numbers of individually insignificant players, the ocean. Unlike standard equilibrium models, they focus on measuring the value (or power) per entity and per unit of resource} in a given distribution of resources. These values are viewed as strategic components in coalition formations, mergers and resource acquisitions. Considering such issues relevant to blockchain governance and long-term sustainability, we adapt oceanic games to blockchain mining and illustrate the defined concepts via examples. The application of existing results reveals incentives for individual miners to merge in order to increase the value of their resources. This offers an alternative perspective to the observed centralization and concentration of mining power. Beyond numerical simulations, we use the model to identify issues relevant to the design of future cryptocurrencies and formulate prospective research questions.",

Scholars have been working on energy conservation of Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning and other systems in buildings. The application of occupant behavior data for building energy optimization has started gaining attention from scholars. However, occupant behavior data concerns many aspects of occupants' privacy. Different types of occupant behavior data contain occupants' private information to different levels. It is crucial to conduct privacy protection of occupant behavior data when using occupant behavior for energy conservation. This paper presents the aspects of privacy issue when using occupant behavior data, and methods to protect data privacy with blockchain technology. Both two options of using blockchain for privacy protection, sending data records as transactions and storing files on the blockchain, are explained and evaluated with temperature records from an open access paper. Sending data as transactions can be used between sensors and local building management system. While storing files on blockchain can be used for collaboration of different building management systems. Advantages, drawbacks, and potentials of using blockchain for data and file transfer are discussed. The results should be helpful for using occupant behavior data for building energy optimization.",

    "abstract": "Traceability and integrity are major challenges for the increasingly complex supply chains of today's world. Although blockchain technology has the potential to address these challenges through providing a tamper-proof audit trail of supply chain events and data associated with a product life-cycle, it does not solve the trust problem associated with the data itself. Reputation systems are an effective approach to solve this trust problem. However, current reputation systems are not suited to the blockchain based supply chain applications as they are based on limited observations, they lack granularity and automation, and their overhead has not been explored. In this work, we propose TrustChain, as a three-layered trust management framework which uses a consortium blockchain to track interactions among supply chain participants and to dynamically assign trust and reputation scores based on these interactions. The novelty of TrustChain stems from: (a) the reputation model that evaluates the quality of commodities, and the trustworthiness of entities based on multiple observations of supply chain events, (b) its support for reputation scores that separate between a supply chain participant and products, enabling the assignment of product-specific reputations for the same participant, (c) the use of smart contracts for transparent, efficient, secure, and automated calculation of reputation scores, and (d) its minimal overhead in terms of latency and throughput when compared to a simple blockchain based supply chain model.",

    "abstract": "All public blockchains are secured by a proof of opportunity cost among block producers. For example, the security offered by proof-of-work (PoW) systems, like Bitcoin, is due to spent computation; it is work precisely because it cannot be performed for free. In general, more resources provably lost in producing blocks yields more security for the blockchain. When two blockchains share the same mechanism for providing opportunity cost, as is the case when they share the same PoW algorithm, the two chains compete for resources from block producers. Indeed, if there exists a liquid market between resource types, then theoretically all blockchains will compete for resources. In this paper, we show that there exists a resource allocation equilibrium between any two blockchains, which is essentially driven by the fiat value of reward that each chain offers in return for providing security. We go on to prove that this equilibrium is singular and always achieved provided that block producers behave in a greedy, but cautious fashion. The opposite is true when they are overly greedy: resource allocation oscillates in extremes between the two chains. We show that these results hold both in practice and in a block generation simulation. Finally, we demonstrate several applications of this theory including a trustless price-ratio oracle, increased security for blockchains whose coins have lower fiat value, and a quantification of cost to allocating resources away from the equilibrium.",

Alarmingly, when utilising Blockchain for developing a personal data management system, fictions have occurred in existing approaches and been promulgated in the literature. Such fictions are theoretically doable; however, by thoroughly breaking down consensus protocols and transaction validation processes, we clarify that such existing approaches are either impractical or highly inefficient due to the natural limitations of the blockchain and Smart Contracts technologies. This encourages us to propose a feasible solution in which such fictions are reduced by designing a novel system architecture with a blockchain-based \"proof of permission\" protocol. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed models by implementing a clinical data sharing service built on top of a public blockchain platform. We believe that our research resolves existing ambiguity and take a step further on providing a practically feasible solution for decentralised personal data management.",

However, one particularly critical threat in the PoS setting is the well-known long-range attacks caused by secret key leakage (LRSL attack). Specifically, an adversary can attempt to control/compromise accounts possessing substantial stake at some past moment such that double-spend or erase past transactions, violating the fundamental persistence property of blockchain. Puncturable signatures provide a satisfying solution to construct practical proof-of-stake blockchain resilient to LRSL attack, despite of the fact that existent constructions are not efficient enough for practical deployments. In this paper, we provide an in-depth study of puncturable signatures and explore its applications in the proof-of-stake blockchain. We formalize a security model that allows the adversary for adaptive signing and puncturing queries, and show a construction with efficient puncturing operations based on the Bloom filter data structure and strong Diffie-Hellman assumption. The puncturing functionality we desire is for a particular part of message, like prefix, instead of the whole message. Furthermore, we use puncturable signatures to construct practical proof-of-stake blockchain protocols that are resilient to LRSL attack, while previously the forward-secure signature is used to immunize this attack. We implement our scheme and provide experimental results showing that in comparison with the forward-secure signature, our construction performs substantially better on signature size, signing and verification efficiency, significantly on key update efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains are becoming increasingly relevant in a variety of fields, such as finance, logistics, and real estate. The fundamental task of a blockchain system is to establish data consistency among distributed agents in an open network. Blockchain consensus protocols are central for performing this task. Since consensus protocols play such a crucial role in blockchain technology, several projects are underway that apply formal methods to these protocols. One such project is carried out by a team of the Formal Methods Group at IOHK. This project, in which the author is involved, aims at a formally verified implementation of the Ouroboros family of consensus protocols, the backbone of the Cardano blockchain. The first outcome of our project is the $\\natural$-calculus (pronounced \"natural calculus\"), a general-purpose process calculus that serves as our implementation language. The $\\natural$-calculus is a domain-specific language embedded in a functional host language using higher-order abstract syntax. This paper will be a ramble through the $\\natural$-calculus. First we will look at its language and its operational semantics. The latter is unique in that it uses a stack of two labeled transition systems to treat phenomena like data transfer and the opening and closing of channel scope in a modular fashion. The presence of multiple transition systems calls for a generic treatment of derived concurrency concepts. We will see how such a treatment can be achieved by capturing notions like scope opening and silent transitions abstractly using axiomatically defined algebraic structures based on functors and monads.",

We propose the utilization of proof of work systems to have an online estimation of the available computational resources at different robots. Furthermore, we define smart contracts that integrate information about the environment from different robots in order to evaluate and rank the quality and accuracy of each of the robots' sensor data. This means that the key parameters involved in heterogeneous robotic collaboration are integrated within the Blockchain and estimated at all robots equally without explicitly sharing information about the robots' hardware or sensors. Trustability is based on the verification of data samples that are submitted to the blockchain within each data exchange transaction and validated by other robots operating in the same environment. Initial results are reported which show the viability of the concepts presented in this paper.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming our physical world into a complex and dynamic system of connected devices on an unprecedented scale. Connecting everyday physical objects is creating new business models, improving processes and reducing costs and risks. Recently, blockchain technology has received a lot of attention from the community as a possible solution to overcome security issues in IoT. However, traditional blockchains (such as the ones used in Bitcoin and Ethereum) are not well suited to the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices and also with the large volume of information that is expected to be generated from typical IoT deployments. To overcome these issues, several researchers have presented lightweight instances of blockchains tailored for IoT. For example, proposing novel data structures based on blocks with decoupled and appendable data. However, these researchers did not discuss how the consensus algorithm would impact their solutions, i.e., the decision of which consensus algorithm would be better suited was left as an open issue. In this paper, we improved an appendable-block blockchain framework to support different consensus algorithms through a modular design. We evaluated the performance of this improved version in different emulated scenarios and studied the impact of varying the number of devices and transactions and employing different consensus algorithms. Even adopting different consensus algorithms, results indicate that the latency to append a new block is less than 161ms (in the more demanding scenario) and the delay for processing a new transaction is less than 7ms, suggesting that our improved version of the appendable-block blockchain is efficient and scalable, and thus well suited for IoT scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology has evolved as a promising means to transform data management models in many domains including healthcare, agricultural research, tourism domains etc. In the research community, a usable blockchain-based system can allow users to create a proof of ownership and provenance of the research work, share research data without losing control and ownership of it, provide incentives for sharing and give users full transparency and control over who access their data, when and for what purpose. The initial adoption of such blockchain-based systems is necessary for continued use of the services, but their user acceptance behavioral model has not been well investigated in the literature. In this paper, we take the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as a foundation and extend the external constructs to uncover how the perceived ease of use, perceived usability, quality of the system and perceived enjoyment influence the intention to use the blockchain-based system. We based our study on user evaluation of a prototype of a blockchain-based research data sharing framework using a TAM validated questionnaire. Our results show that, overall, all the individual constructs of the behavior model significantly influence the intention to use the system while their collective effect is found to be insignificant. The quality of the system and the perceived enjoyment have stronger influence on the perceived usefulness. However, the effect of perceived ease of use on the perceived usefulness is not supported. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings.",

    "abstract": "In today's connected world, resource constrained devices are deployed for sensing and decision making applications, ranging from smart cities to environmental monitoring. Those recourse constrained devices are connected to create real-time distributed networks popularly known as the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing and edge computing. The blockchain is gaining a lot of interest in these domains to secure the system by ignoring centralized dependencies, where proof-of-work (PoW) plays a vital role to make the whole security solution decentralized. Due to the resource limitations of the devices, PoW is not suitable for blockchain-based security solutions. This paper presents a novel consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Authentication (PoAh), which introduces a cryptographic authentication mechanism to replace PoW for resource constrained devices, and to make the blockchain application-specific. PoAh is thus suitable for private as well as permissioned blockchains. Further, PoAh not only secures the systems, but also maintains system sustainability and scalability. The proposed consensus algorithm is evaluated theoretically in simulation scenarios, and in real-time hardware testbeds to validate its performance. Finally, PoAh and its integration with the blockchain in the IoT and edge computing scenarios is discussed. The proposed PoAh, while running in limited computer resources (e.g. single-board computing devices like the Raspberry Pi) has a latency in the order of 3 secs.",

    "abstract": "The growing number of applications for distributed ledger technologies is driving both industry and academia to solve the limitations of blockchain, particularly its scalability issues. Recent distributed ledger technologies have replaced the blockchain linear structure with a more flexible directed acyclic graph in an attempt to accommodate a higher throughput. Despite the fast-growing diffusion of directed acyclic graph based distributed ledger technologies, researchers lack a basic understanding of their behavior. In this paper we analyze the Tangle, a directed acyclic graph that is used (with certain modifications) in various protocols such as IOTA, Byteball, Avalanche or SPECTRE. Our contribution is threefold. First, we run simulations in a continuous-time model to examine tip count stability and cumulative weight evolution while varying the rate of incoming transactions. In particular we confirm analytical predictions on the number of tips with uniform random tip selection strategy. Second, we show how different tip selection algorithms affect the growth of the Tangle. Moreover, we explain these differences by analyzing the spread of exit probabilities of random walks. Our findings confirm analytically derived predictions and provide novel insights on the different phases of growth of cumulative weight as well as on the average time difference for a transaction to receive its first approval when using distinct tip selection algorithms. Lastly, we analyze simulation overhead and performance as a function of Tangle size and compare results for different tip selection algorithms.",

    "abstract": "A blockchain, such as Bitcoin, is an append-only, secure, transparent, distributed ledger. A fair blockchain is expected to have healthy metrics; high honest mining power, low processing latency, i.e., low wait times for transactions and stable price of consumption, i.e., the minimum transaction fee required to have a transaction processed. As Bitcoin matures, the influx of transactions increases and the block rewards become insignificant. We show that under these conditions, it becomes hard to maintain the health of the blockchain. In Bitcoin, under these mature operating conditions (MOC), the miners would find it challenging to cover their mining costs as there would be no more revenue from merely mining a block. It may cause miners not to continue mining, threatening the blockchain's security. Further, as we show in this paper using simulations, the cost of acting in favor of the health of the blockchain, under MOC, is very high in Bitcoin, causing all miners to process transactions greedily. It leads to stranded transactions, i.e., transactions offering low transaction fees, experiencing unreasonably high processing latency. To make matters worse, a compounding effect of these stranded transactions is the rising price of consumption. Such phenomena not only induce unfairness as experienced by the miners and the users but also deteriorate the health of the blockchain. We propose BitcoinF transaction processing protocol, a simple, yet highly effective modification to the existing Bitcoin protocol to fix these issues of unfairness. BitcoinF resolves these issues of unfairness while preserving the ability of the users to express urgency and have their transactions prioritized.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts have enabled blockchain systems to evolve from simple cryptocurrency platforms, such as Bitcoin, to general transactional systems, such as Ethereum. Catering for emerging business requirements, a new architecture called execute-order-validate has been proposed in Hyperledger Fabric to support parallel transactions and improve the blockchain's throughput. However, this new architecture might render many invalid transactions when serializing them. This problem is further exaggerated as the block formation rate is inherently limited due to other factors beside data processing, such as cryptography and consensus. In this work, we propose a novel method to enhance the execute-order-validate architecture, by reducing invalid transactions to improve the throughput of blockchains. Our method is inspired by state-of-the-art optimistic concurrency control techniques in modern database systems. In contrast to existing blockchains that adopt database's preventive approaches which might abort serializable transactions, our method is theoretically more fine-grained. Specifically, unserializable transactions are aborted before ordering and the remaining transactions are guaranteed to be serializable. For evaluation, we implement our method in two blockchains respectively, FabricSharp on top of Hyperledger Fabric, and FastFabricSharp on top of FastFabric. We compare the performance of FabricSharp with vanilla Fabric and three related systems, two of which are respectively implemented with one standard and one state-of-the-art concurrency control techniques from databases. The results demonstrate that FabricSharp achieves 25% higher throughput compared to the other systems in nearly all experimental scenarios. Moreover, the FastFabricSharp's improvement over FastFabric is up to 66%.",

Despite its popularity (e.g., 89,800,000 blocks generated till November 14, 2019 since its launch on June 8, 2018), few studies have been made on data analysis of EOSIO. To fill this gap, we collect and process the up-to-date on-chain data from EOSIO. We name these well-processed EOSIO datasets as XBlock-EOS, which consists of 7 well-processed datasets: 1) Block, Transaction and Action, 2) Internal and External EOS Transfer Action, 3) Contract Information, 4) Contract Invocation, 5) Token Action, 6) Account Creation, 7) Resource Management. It is challenging to process and analyze a high volume of raw EOSIO data and establish the mapping from original raw data to the well-grained datasets since it requires substantial efforts in extracting various types of data as well as sophisticated knowledge on software engineering and data analytics. Meanwhile, we present statistics and exploration on these datasets. Moreover, we also outline the possible research opportunities based on XBlock-EOS.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of industries rely on Internet-of-Things devices to track physical resources. Blockchain technology provides primitives to represent these resources as digital assets on a secure distributed ledger. Due to the proliferation of blockchain-based assets, there is an increasing need for a generic mechanism to trade assets between isolated platforms. To date, there is no such mechanism without reliance on a trusted third party. In this work, we address this shortcoming and present XChange. Unlike existing approaches for decentralized asset trading, we decouple trade management and the actual exchange of assets. XChange mediates trade of any digital asset between isolated blockchain platforms while limiting the fraud conducted by adversarial parties. We first describe a generic, five-phase trading protocol that establishes and executes trade between individuals. This protocol accounts full trade specifications on a separate blockchain. We then devise a lightweight system architecture, composed of all required components for a generic asset marketplace. We implement XChange and conduct real-world experimentation. We leverage an existing, lightweight blockchain, TrustChain, to account all orders and full trade specifications. By deploying XChange on multiple low-resource devices, we show that a full trade completes within half a second. To quantify the scalability of our mechanism, we conduct further experiments on our compute cluster. We conclude that the throughput of XChange, in terms of trades per second, scales linearly with the system load. Furthermore, we find that XChange exhibits superior throughput and order fulfil latency compared to related decentralized exchanges, BitShares and Waves.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has become particularly popular due to its promise to support business-critical services in very different domains (e.g., retail, supply chains, healthcare). Blockchain systems rely on complex middleware, like Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric, that allow running smart contracts, which specify business logic in cooperative applications. The presence of software defects or faults in these contracts has notably been the cause of failures, including severe security problems. In this paper, we use a software implemented fault injection (SWIFI) technique to assess the behavior of permissioned blockchain systems in the presence of faulty smart contracts. We emulate the occurrence of general software faults (e.g., missing variable initialization) and also blockchain-specific software faults (e.g., missing require statement on transaction sender) in smart contracts code to observe the impact on the overall system dependability (i.e., reliability and integrity). We also study the effectiveness of formal verification (i.e., done by solc-verify) and runtime protections (e.g., using the assert statement) mechanisms in detection of injected faults. Results indicate that formal verification as well as additional runtime protections have to complement built-in platform checks to guarantee the proper dependability of blockchain systems and applications. The work presented in this paper allows smart contract developers to become aware of possible faults in smart contracts and to understand the impact of their presence. It also provides valuable information for middleware developers to improve the behavior (e.g., overall fault tolerance) of their systems.",

    "abstract": "Clients of permissionless blockchain systems, like Bitcoin, rely on an underlying peer-to-peer network to send and receive transactions. It is critical that a client is connected to at least one honest peer, as otherwise the client can be convinced to accept a maliciously forked view of the blockchain. In such an eclipse attack, the client is unable to reliably distinguish the canonical view of the blockchain from the view provided by the attacker. The consequences of this can be catastrophic if the client makes business decisions based on a distorted view of the blockchain transactions. In this paper, we investigate the design space and propose two approaches for Bitcoin clients to detect whether an eclipse attack against them is ongoing. Each approach chooses a different trade-off between average attack detection time and network load. The first scheme is based on the detection of suspicious block timestamps. The second scheme allows blockchain clients to utilize their natural connections to the Internet (i.e., standard web activity) to gossip about their blockchain views with contacted servers and their other clients. Our proposals improve upon previously proposed eclipse attack countermeasures without introducing any dedicated infrastructure or changes to the Bitcoin protocol and network, and we discuss an implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the gossip-based schemes through rigorous analysis using original Internet traffic traces and real-world deployment. The results indicate that our protocol incurs a negligible overhead and detects eclipse attacks rapidly with high probability, and is well-suited for practical deployment.",

As the variety of existing blockchains and distributed ledgers continues to increase, adopters should focus on selecting the solution that best fits their needs and the requirements of their decentralized applications, rather than developing yet another blockchain from scratch. In this paper we present a conceptual framework to aid software architects, developers, and decision makers to adopt the right blockchain technology. The framework exposes the interrelation between technological decisions and architectural features, capturing the knowledge from existing academic literature, industrial products, technical forums/blogs, and experts' feedback. We empirically show the applicability of our framework by dissecting the platforms behind Bitcoin and other top 10 cryptocurrencies, aided by a focus group with researchers and industry practitioners. Then, we leverage the framework together with key notions of the Architectural Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) to analyze four real-world blockchain case studies from industry and academia. Results shown that applying our framework leads to a deeper understanding of the architectural tradeoffs, allowing to assess technologies more objectively and select the one that best fit developers needs, ultimately cutting costs, reducing time-to-market and accelerating return on investment.",

In order to attract more hash computing power, the miner who finds the proper block can obtain some rewards. Actually, these hash calculations ensure that the data of the blockchain is not easily tampered. Thus, the incentive mechanism for mining affects the security of the blockchain directly. This paper presents an approach to attack against the difficulty adjustment algorithm (abbreviated as DAA) used in blockchain mining, which has a direct impact on miners' earnings. In this method, the attack miner jumps between different blockchains to get more benefits than the honest miner who keep mining on only one blockchain. We build a probabilistic model to simulate the time to obtain the next block at different hash computing power called hashrate. Based on this model, we analyze the DAAs of the major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, and Bitcoin Gold. We further verify the effectiveness of this attack called jumping mining through simulation experiments, and also get the characters for the attack in the public block data of Bitcoin Gold. Finally, we give an improved DAA scheme against this attack. Extensive experiments are provided to support the efficiency of our designed scheme.",

As they allow processing transactions off-chain, payment channel networks are referred to as second layer technology, while the blockchain is the first layer. We uncouple payment channel networks from blockchains and look at them as first-class citizens. This brings up the question what model payment channel networks require as first layer. In response, we formalize a model (called RFL Model) for a first layer below a payment channel network. While transactions are globally made available by a blockchain, the RFL Model only provides the reduced property that a transaction is delivered to the users being affected by a transaction. We show that the reduced model's properties still suffice to implement payment channels. By showing that the RFL Model can not only be instantiated by the Bitcoin blockchain but also by trusted third parties like banks, we show that the reduction widens the design space for the first layer. Further, we show that the stronger property provided by blockchains allows for optimizations that can be used to reduce the time for locking collateral during payments over multiple hops in a payment channel network.",

A blockchain ensures that all entities in the voting system have the same view of the actions made by others due to its immutable and append-only log. The existing blockchain-based boardroom voting solution called Open Voting Network (OVN) provides the privacy of votes and perfect ballot secrecy, but it supports only two candidates. We present BBB-Voting, an equivalent blockchain-based approach for decentralized voting than OVN, but in contrast to it, BBB-Voting supports 1-out-of-$k$ choices and provides a fault tolerance mechanism that enables recovery from stalling participants. We provide a cost-optimized implementation using Ethereum, which we compare with OVN and show that our work decreases the costs for voters by $13.5\\%$ in terms of gas consumption. Next, we outline the extension of our implementation scaling to magnitudes higher number of participants than in a boardroom voting, while preserving the costs paid by the authority and participants -- we made proof-of-concept experiments with up to 1000 participants.",

However, high mobility of vehicles and dynamic wireless channel condition make it challenge to design an optimal content caching policy. Further, with much sensitive personal information, vehicles may be not willing to caching their contents to an untrusted caching provider. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is an emerging technique to solve the problem with high-dimensional and time-varying features. Permission blockchain is able to establish a secure and decentralized peer-to-peer transaction environment. In this paper, we integrate DRL and permissioned blockchain into vehicular networks for intelligent and secure content caching. We first propose a blockchain empowered distributed content caching framework where vehicles perform content caching and base stations maintain the permissioned blockchain. Then, we exploit the advanced DRL approach to design an optimal content caching scheme with taking mobility into account. Finally, we propose a new block verifier selection method, Proof-of-Utility (PoU), to accelerate block verification process. Security analysis shows that our proposed blockchain empowered content caching can achieve security and privacy protection. Numerical results based on a real dataset from Uber indicate that the DRL-inspired content caching scheme significantly outperforms two benchmark policies.",

It seems that the decentralized peer-to-peer nature of blockchains makes it interesting to consider them in serverless architectures, since resource allocation and management tasks are not required to be performed by users. Moreover, considering their useful properties of ensuring transaction's immutability and facilitating accountable interactions, blockchains might enhance the overall guarantees and capabilities of serverless architectures. Therefore, in this work, we analyze how the blockchain technology and smart contracts fit into the serverless picture and derive a set of scenarios in which they act as different component types in serverless architectures. Furthermore, we formulate the implementation requirements that have to be fulfilled to successfully use blockchains and smart contracts in these scenarios. Finally, we investigate which existing technologies enable these scenarios, and analyze their readiness and suitability to fulfill the formulated requirements.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain plays an important role in cryptocurrency markets and technology services. However, limitations on high latency and low scalability retard their adoptions and applications in classic designs. Reconstructed blockchain systems have been proposed to avoid the consumption of competitive transactions caused by linear sequenced blocks. These systems, instead, structure transactions/blocks in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and consequently re-build upper layer components including consensus, incentives, \\textit{etc.} The promise of DAG-based blockchain systems is to enable fast confirmation (complete transactions within million seconds) and high scalability (attach transactions in parallel) without significantly compromising security. However, this field still lacks systematic work that summarises the DAG technique. To bridge the gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) provides a comprehensive analysis of DAG-based blockchain systems. Through deconstructing open-sourced systems and reviewing academic researches, we conclude the main components and featured properties of systems, and provide the approach to establish a DAG. With this in hand, we analyze the security and performance of several leading systems, followed by discussions and comparisons with concurrent (scaling blockchain) techniques. We further identify open challenges to highlight the potentiality of DAG-based solutions and indicate their promising directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "With the booming of smart grid, The ubiquitously deployed smart meters constitutes an energy internet of things. This paper develops a novel blockchain-based transactive energy management system for IoT-aided smart homes. We consider a holistic set of options for smart homes to participate in transactive energy. Smart homes can interact with the grid to perform vertical transactions, e.g., feeding in extra solar energy to the grid and providing demand response service to alleviate the grid load. Smart homes can also interact with peer users to perform horizontal transactions, e.g., peer-to-peer energy trading. However, conventional transactive energy management method suffers from the drawbacks of low efficiency, privacy leakage, and single-point failure. To address these challenges, we develop a privacy-preserving distributed algorithm that enables users to optimally manage their energy usages in parallel via the smart contract on the blockchain. Further, we design an efficient blockchain system tailored for IoT devices and develop the smart contract to support the holistic transactive energy management system. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility and performance of the blockchain-based transactive energy management system through extensive simulations and experiments. The results show that the blockchain-based transactive energy management system is feasible on practical IoT devices and reduces the overall cost by 25%.",

    "abstract": "Existing blockchain systems scale poorly because of their distributed consensus protocols. Current attempts at improving blockchain scalability are limited to cryptocurrency. Scaling blockchain systems under general workloads (i.e., non-cryptocurrency applications) remains an open question. In this work, we take a principled approach to apply sharding, which is a well-studied and proven technique to scale out databases, to blockchain systems in order to improve their transaction throughput at scale. This is challenging, however, due to the fundamental difference in failure models between databases and blockchain. To achieve our goal, we first enhance the performance of Byzantine consensus protocols, by doing so we improve individual shards' throughput. Next, we design an efficient shard formation protocol that leverages a trusted random beacon to securely assign nodes into shards. We rely on trusted hardware, namely Intel SGX, to achieve high performance for both consensus and shard formation protocol. Third, we design a general distributed transaction protocol that ensures safety and liveness even when transaction coordinators are malicious. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of our design both on a local cluster and on Google Cloud Platform. The results show that our consensus and shard formation protocols outperform state-of-the-art solutions at scale. More importantly, our sharded blockchain reaches a high throughput that can handle Visa-level workloads, and is the largest ever reported in a realistic environment.",

    "abstract": "Full nodes, which synchronize the entire blockchain history and independently validate all the blocks, form the backbone of any blockchain network by playing a vital role in ensuring security properties. On the other hand, a user running a full node needs to pay a heavy price in terms of storage costs. E.g., the Bitcoin blockchain size has grown over 215GB, in spite of its low throughput. The ledger size for a high throughput blockchain Ripple has already reached 9TB, and it is growing at an astonishing rate of 12GB per day! In this paper, we propose an architecture based on 'fountain codes', a class of erasure codes, that enables any full node to 'encode' validated blocks into a small number of 'coded blocks', thereby reducing its storage costs by orders of magnitude. In particular, our proposed \"Secure Fountain (SeF)\" architecture can achieve a near-optimal trade-off between the storage savings per node and the 'bootstrap cost' in terms of the number of (honest) storage-constrained nodes a new node needs to contact to recover the blockchain. A key technical innovation in SeF codes is to make fountain codes secure against adversarial nodes that can provide maliciously formed coded blocks. Our idea is to use the header-chain as a 'side-information' to check whether a coded block is maliciously formed while it is getting decoded. Further, the 'rateless property' of fountain codes helps in achieving high decentralization and scalability. Our experiments demonstrate that SeF codes tuned to achieve 1000x storage savings enable full nodes to encode the 191GB Bitcoin blockchain into 195MB on average. A new node can recover the blockchain from an arbitrary set of storage-constrained nodes as long as the set contains ~1100 honest nodes on average. Note that for a 1000x storage savings, the fundamental bound on the number of honest nodes to contact is 1000: we need about 10% more in practice.",

The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. Despite all these advantages that 5G will bring about, there are still major challenges to be addressed, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, network privacy and security vulnerabilities. Blockchain can offer innovative solutions to effectively solve the challenges in 5G networks. Driven by the dramatically increased capacities of the 5G networks and the recent breakthroughs in the blockchain technology, blockchain-based 5G services are expected to witness a rapid development and bring substantial benefits to future society. In this paper, we provide a state-of-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. Our key focus is on the discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud/edge computing, Software Defined Networks, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore the opportunities of blockchain to important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in various domains, i.e. smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the survey are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified. Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research on this newly emerging area.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, blockchain technology has received unparalleled attention from academia, industry, and governments all around the world. It is considered a technological breakthrough anticipated to disrupt several application domains. This has resulted in a plethora of blockchain systems for various purposes. However, many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious shortcomings related to their performance and security, which need to be addressed before any wide-scale adoption can be achieved. A crucial component of any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which in many ways, determines its performance and security. Therefore, to address the limitations of different blockchain systems, several existing as well novel consensus algorithms have been introduced. A systematic analysis of these algorithms will help to understand how and why any particular blockchain performs the way it functions. However, the existing studies of consensus algorithms are not comprehensive. Those studies have incomplete discussions on the properties of the algorithms and fail to analyse several major blockchain consensus algorithms in terms of their scopes. This article fills this gap by analysing a wide range of consensus algorithms using a comprehensive taxonomy of properties and by examining the implications of different issues still prevalent in consensus algorithms in detail. The result of the analysis is presented in tabular formats, which provides a visual illustration of these algorithms in a meaningful way. We have also analysed more than hundred top crypto-currencies belonging to different categories of consensus algorithms to understand their properties and to implicate different trends in these crypto-currencies. Finally, we have presented a decision tree of algorithms to be used as a tool to test the suitability of consensus algorithms under different criteria.",

We quantify our probabilistic analysis with statistics taken from the R3 consortium, and show that a single machine needs 20 minutes to attack the consortium. Finally, we run an Ethereum private chain in a distributed system with similar settings as R3 to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, and discuss the application of the Balance attack to Bitcoin.

To overcome this limitation, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a BFT ordering service for HLF on top of the BFT-SMaRt state machine replication/consensus library, implementing also optimizations for wide-area deployment. Our results show that HLF with our ordering service can achieve up to ten thousand transactions per second and write a transaction irrevocably in the blockchain in half a second, even with peers spread in different continents.",

The proposed model allows us to quickly collect information about identities owning Bitcoin addresses and to recover measures and statistics on the Bitcoin network. By exploiting algebraic formalism, we reconstructed an Entities network associated to Blockchain transactions gathering together Bitcoin addresses into the single entity holding permits to manage Bitcoins held by those addresses. The model allows also to identify a set of behaviours typical of Bitcoin owners, like that of using an address only once, and to reconstruct chains for this behaviour together with the rate of firing. Our model is highly flexible and can easily be adapted to include different features of the Bitcoin crypto-currency system.",

However, online portals' operators act as central authorities throughout the overall review process. In the worst case, operators can exclude users from submitting reviews, modify existing reviews, and introduce fake reviews by fictional consumers. This paper presents ReviewChain, a decentralized review approach. Our approach avoids central authorities by using blockchain technologies, decentralized apps and storage. Thereby, we enable users to submit and retrieve untampered reviews. We highlight the implementation challenges encountered when realizing our approach on the public Ethereum blockchain. For each implementation challange, we discuss possible design alternatives and their trade-offs regarding costs, security, and trustworthiness. Finally, we analyze which design decision should be chosen to support specific trade-offs and present resulting combinations of decentralized blockchain technologies, also with conventional centralized technologies.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain-based consensus protocols present the opportunity to develop new protocols, due to their novel requirements of open participation and explicit incentivization of participants. To address the first requirement, it is necessary to consider the leader election inherent in consensus protocols, which can be difficult to scale to a large and untrusted set of participants. To address the second, it is important to consider ways to provide incentivization without relying on the resource-intensive proofs-of-work used in Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose a secure leader election protocol, Caucus; we next fit this protocol into a broader blockchain-based consensus protocol, Fantomette, that provides game-theoretic guarantees in addition to traditional blockchain security properties. Fantomette is the first proof-of-stake protocol to give formal game-theoretic proofs of security in the presence of non-rational players.",

To provide identity within the context of mutual distrust, this paper presents a blockchain-based digital identity solution. Without depending upon a single trusted third party, the proposed solution achieves passport-level legally valid identity. This solution for making identities Self-Sovereign, builds on a generic provable claim model for which attestations of truth from third parties need to be collected. The claim model is then shown to be both blockchain structure and proof method agnostic. Four different implementations in support of these two claim model properties are shown to offer sub-second performance for claim creation and claim verification. Through the properties of Self-Sovereign Identity, legally valid status and acceptable performance, our solution is considered to be fit for adoption by the general public.",

Security concerns, trust restrictions, and scalability limits regarding the resource requirements of users hamper the sustainable development of loosely-coupled services on blockchains. This paper introduces Aspen, a sharded blockchain protocol designed to securely scale with increasing number of services. Aspen shares the same trust model as Bitcoin in a peer-to-peer network that is prone to extreme churn containing Byzantine participants.

We depart from the current trust model that delegates access control of our data to a centralized trusted authority and instead empower the users with data ownership. Our design is tailored for IoT data streams and enables secure data sharing. We enable a secure and resilient access control management, by utilizing the blockchain as an auditable and distributed access control layer to the storage layer. We facilitate the storage of time-series IoT data at the edge of the network via a locality-aware decentralized storage system that is managed with the blockchain technology. Our system is agnostic of the physical storage nodes and supports as well utilization of cloud storage resources as storage nodes.",

Traditional security methods are incapable to provide secure IV communication.

Blockchain technology works for the crypto currency, Bit-coin, which is recently used to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks having similar topologies as IV Communication. In this paper, we are proposing, Intelligent Vehicle-Trust Point (IV-TP) mechanism for IV communication among IVs using Blockchain technology. The IVs communicated data provides security and reliability using our proposed IV-TP. Our IV-TP mechanism provides trustworthiness for vehicles behavior, and vehicles legal and illegal action. Our proposal presents a reward based system, an exchange of some IV-TP among IVs, during successful communication. For the data management of the IV-TP, we are using blockchain technology in the intelligent transportation system (ITS), which stores all IV-TP details of every vehicle and is accessed ubiquitously by IVs. In this paper, we evaluate our proposal with the help of intersection use case scenario for intelligent vehicles communication.",

Unfortunately, there is no explicit incentive for such transaction propagation. Therefore, existing propagation mechanisms will not be sustainable in a fully decentralized blockchain with rational nodes. In this work, we formally define the problem of incentivizing nodes for transaction propagation. We propose an incentive mechanism where each node involved in the propagation of a transaction receives a share of the transaction fee. We also show that our proposal is Sybil-proof. Furthermore, we combine the incentive mechanism with smart routing to reduce the communication and storage costs at the same time. The proposed routing mechanism reduces the redundant transaction propagation from the size of the network to a factor of average shortest path length. The routing mechanism is built upon a specific type of consensus protocol where the round leader who creates the transaction block is known in advance. Note that our routing mechanism is a generic one and can be adopted independently from the incentive mechanism.",

Further, there is no flexible way to trade privacy against efficiency to adjust to practical needs.

Since bitcoin and altcoins all utilize an underlying blockchain, they are therefore greatly affected by the performance of the P2P network. In bitcoin, the miners are engaged in a time-sensitive competition to solve a Proof-of-Work problem to extend the blockchain. This consequently raises a critical problem to minimize the time between the propagation of a winning block and the beginning of the next round of the competition. This paper proposes a method that selects a node's closest neighbors to make messages propagate in the whole network in time. The method measures the distance from a node to its neighbor using transmission latency; thus, the lower the latency, the closer the neighbor. Simulations showed a good rate of decrease in average propagation latency and maximum propagation latency, compared to the classic method. Furthermore, this paper not only proposes the principle of establishing connections based on latency, but also evaluates the influence of the number of simultaneously established connections.",

    "abstract": "With the increase of web users and applications with real time requests, the ability to identify, track and trace elements of a product as it moves in the supply chain is deemed necessary, and for many industries is even mandated by national or international regulations. Traceability presupposes the integrity and transparency of data that is saved and shared. This is a problem for current technologies, as there are many examples with tampered data and database vulnerabilities that resulted in serious implications and data loss. A solution to this problem can be the decentralization of the system, which will remove the central point of failure. To that effect, blockchain or DLT technologies, an emergent technology that enables the decentralization of a network can be used, by implementing a trustless model to achieve it. Blockchains are tamperproof and transparent, which means that by exploiting blockchain characteristics, traceability can be improved. A model that describes the decentralization process of the supply chain traceability part has been developed for this paper and is later evaluated and compared with the traditional system.",

    "abstract": "Growing consumer awareness as well as manufacturers' internal quality requirements lead to novel demands on supply chain traceability. Existing centralized solutions suffer from isolated data storage and lacking trust when multiple parties are involved. Decentralized blockchain-based approaches attempt to overcome these shortcomings by creating digital representations of physical goods to facilitate tracking across multiple entities. However, they currently do not capture the transformation of goods in manufacturing processes. Therefore, the relation between ingredients and product is lost, limiting the ability to trace a product's provenance. We propose a blockchain-based supply chain traceability system using smart contracts. In such contracts, manufacturers define the composition of products in the form of recipes. Each ingredient of the recipe is a non-fungible token that corresponds to a batch of physical goods. When the recipe is applied, its ingredients are consumed and a new token is produced. This mechanism preserves the traceability of product transformations. The system is implemented for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is applicable to any blockchain configuration that supports it. Our evaluation reveals that the gas costs scale linearly with the number of products considered in the system. This leads to the conclusion that the solution can handle complex use cases.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development and popularization of BitCoin, the research of blockchain technology has also shown growth. It has gradually become a new generation of distributed, non-centralized and trust-based technology solution. However, the blockchain operation is expensive and transaction is delayed. Take BitCoin as an example. On the one hand, a block is produced every ten minute. On the other hand, once the new block is generated, it takes a certain time to propagate world wide. The slow speed of propagation determines that BitCoin can not use too small block interval time. Ethereum also faces similar problems, so the concept of uncle block was introduced to reduce blockchain forks. This paper introduces a new tree structure based broadcast propagation routing model, providing a novel method to organize network nodes and message propagation mechanism. In oder to avoid the single node failure problem, the tree cluster routing is proposed. The research shows that the tree based routing can accelerate broadcast convergence time and reduce redundant traffic.",

By outlining the limitations of existing countermeasures, we highlight a need for new defense strategies to counter this attack, and leverage key system parameters in blockchain applications to propose an algorithm that enforces fair mining. We use the expected transaction confirmation height and block publishing height to detect selfish mining behavior and develop a network-wide defense mechanism to disincentivize selfish miners.

We demonstrate its performance with a prototype implementation and large-scale experiments with up to 50,000 nodes. In our experiments, OHIE achieves linear scaling with available bandwidth, providing about 4-10 Mbps transaction throughput (under 8-20 Mbps per-node available bandwidth configurations) and at least about 20x better decentralization over prior works.",

Existing platforms allow such processes to be modeled using high-level notations and compiled into smart contracts that can be deployed on blockchain platforms. However, these platforms brush aside the question of who is allowed to execute which tasks in the process, either by deferring the question altogether or by adopting a static approach where all actors are bound to roles upon process instantiation. Yet, a key advantage of blockchains is their ability to support dynamic sets of actors. This paper presents a model for dynamic binding of actors to roles in collaborative processes and an associated binding policy specification language. The proposed language is endowed with a Petri net semantics, thus enabling policy consistency verification. The paper also outlines an approach to compile policy specifications into smart contracts for enforcement. An experimental evaluation shows that the cost of policy enforcement increases linearly with the number of roles and constraints.",

However, this is not the case for multi-administrative domains, e.g. among different enterprises. In such situation, new problems arise that challenge classical solutions such as PKIs, which suffer from scalability and granularity concerns. In this paper, we present an extension to Group-Based Policy -- a widely used network policy language -- for the aforementioned scenario. To do so, we take advantage of a permissioned blockchain implementation (Hyperledger Fabric) to distribute access control policies in a secure and auditable manner, preserving at the same time the independence of each organization. Network administrators specify polices that are rendered into blockchain transactions. A LISP control plane (RFC 6830) allows routers performing the access control to query the blockchain for authorizations. We have implemented an end-to-end experimental prototype and evaluated it in terms of scalability and network latency.",

In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain design that fully recycles the energy required for facilitating and maintaining it, which is re-invested to the computation of deep learning.

When the majority threshold is lower than the proportion of Byzantine processes, invalid blocks are accepted in equilibrium. When the majority threshold is large, equilibrium can involve coordination failures , in which no block is ever accepted. However, when the cost of accepting invalid blocks is large, there exists an equilibrium in which blocks are accepted iff they are valid.",

This lack of randomness is a consequential limitation, given that a wide variety of real-world financial contracts, such as casino games and lotteries, depend entirely on randomness. As a result, several ad-hoc random number generation approaches have been developed to be used in smart contracts. These include ideas such as using an oracle or relying on the block hash. However, these approaches are manipulatable, i.e. their output can be tampered with by parties who might not be neutral, such as the owner of the oracle or the miners. We propose a novel game-theoretic approach for generating provably unmanipulatable pseudorandom numbers on the blockchain. Our approach allows smart contracts to access a trustworthy source of randomness that does not rely on potentially compromised miners or oracles, hence enabling the creation of a new generation of smart contracts that are not limited to being non-probabilistic and can be drawn from the much more general class of probabilistic programs.",

To protect against such faults while retaining the PoS selection and reward allocation schemes, we study weighted voting in validator committees. We formalize the block creation process and introduce validators' voting profiles which we update by a multiplicative weights algorithm relative to validators' voting behavior and aggregate blockchain rewards. Using this framework, we leverage weighted majority voting rules that optimize collective decision making to show, both numerically and analytically, that the consensus mechanism is more robust if validators' votes are appropriately scaled. We raise potential issues and limitations of weighted voting in trustless, decentralized networks and relate our results to the design of current PoS protocols.",

To check integrity of remote data, Proof of Retrievability (PoR) schemes were introduced. Existing PoR protocols assume that data owners and third-party auditors are honest and audit only the potentially malicious cloud server to check integrity of stored data. In this paper we consider a system where any party may attempt to cheat others and consider collusion cases. We design a protocol that is secure under such adversarial assumptions and use blockchain smart contracts to act as mediator in case of dispute and payment settlement. We use state channels to reduce blockchain interactions in order to build a practical audit solution. We implement and evaluate a prototype using Ethereum as the blockchain platform and show that our scheme has comparable performance.",

However, the differences in data and smart contract representations, modes of hosting, transaction fees, as well as the need to preserve consistency, immutability, and data provenance introduce unique challenges over database migration. We first present a set of blockchain migration scenarios and data fidelity levels using an illustrative example. We then present a set of migration patterns to address those scenarios and the above data management challenges. Finally, we demonstrate how the effort, cost, and risk of migration could be minimized by choosing a suitable set of data migration patterns, data fidelity level, and proactive system design.

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology provides a tamper-proof mechanism to execute inter-organizational business processes involving mutually untrusted parties. Existing approaches to blockchain-based process execution are based on code generation. In these approaches, a process model is compiled into one or more smart contracts, which are then deployed on a blockchain platform. Given the immutability of the deployed smart contracts, these compiled approaches ensure that all process instances conform to the process model. However, this advantage comes at the price of inflexibility. Any changes to the process model require the redeployment of the smart contracts (a costly operation). In addition, changes cannot be applied to running process instances. To address this lack of flexibility, this paper presents an interpreter of BPMN process models based on dynamic data structures. The proposed interpreter is embedded in a business process execution system with a modular multi-layered architecture, supporting the creation, execution, monitoring and dynamic update of process instances. For efficiency purposes, the interpreter relies on compact bitmap-based encodings of process models. An experimental evaluation shows that the proposed interpreted approach achieves comparable or lower costs relative to existing compiled approaches.",

    "abstract": "Supply chains lend themselves to blockchain technology, but certain challenges remain, especially around invoice financing. For example, the further a supplier is removed from the final consumer product, the more difficult it is to get their invoices financed. Moreover, for competitive reasons, retailers and manufacturers do not want to disclose their supply chains. However, upstream suppliers need to prove that they are part of a `stable' supply chain to get their invoices financed, which presents the upstream suppliers with huge, and often unsurmountable, obstacles to get the necessary finance to fulfil the next order, or to expand their business. Using a fictitious supply chain use case, which is based on a real world use case, we demonstrate how these challenges have the potential to be solved by combining more advanced and specialised blockchain technologies with other technologies such as Artificial Intelligence. We describe how atomic crosschain functionality can be utilised across private blockchains to retrieve the information required for an invoice financier to make informed decisions under uncertainty, and consider the effect this decision has on the overall stability of the supply chain.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain based cryptocurrencies are usually unmanaged, distributed, consensus-based systems in which no single entity has control. Managed cryptocurrencies can be implemented using private blockchains but are fundamentally different as the owners have complete control to do arbitrary activity without transparency (since they control the mining). In this work we explore a hybrid approach where a managed cryptocurrency is maintained through distributed consensus based methods. The currency administrator can perform ongoing management functions while the consensus methods enforce the rules of the cryptocurrency and provide transparency for all management actions. This enables the introduction of money management features common in fiat currencies but where the managing entity cannot perform arbitrary actions and transparency is enforced. We thus eliminate the need for users to trust the currency administrator but also to enable the administrator to manage the cryptocurrency. We demonstrate how to implement our approach through modest modifications to the implicit Bitcoin specification, however, our approach can be applied to most any blockchain based cryptocurrency using a variety of consensus methods.",

    "abstract": "Performance and scalability are major concerns for blockchains: permissionless systems are typically limited by slow proof of X consensus algorithms and sequential post-order transaction execution on every node of the network. By introducing a small amount of trust in their participants, permissioned blockchain systems such as Hyperledger Fabric can benefit from more efficient consensus algorithms and make use of parallel pre-order execution on a subset of network nodes. Fabric, in particular, has been shown to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second. However, this performance is only achievable for contention-free transaction workloads. If many transactions compete for a small set of hot keys in the world state, the effective throughput drops drastically. We therefore propose XOX: a novel two-pronged transaction execution approach that both minimizes invalid transactions in the Fabric blockchain and maximizes concurrent execution. Our approach additionally prevents unintentional denial of service attacks by clients re-submitting conflicting transactions. Even under fully contentious workloads, XOX can handle more than 3000 transactions per second, all of which would be discarded by regular Fabric.",

This shift has led to issues such as trusted coordination and a wider attack surface have come to light, leading to higher costs and bureaucratic interventions. Due to the increasing adoption of connected vehicles, as well as other connected infrastructure, trustless peer to peer systems including blockchain are being explored as potential solution to this efficiency problem. All the while, scalability is still a significant concern for industry players. Current blockchain based systems have difficulty scaling: Bitcoin can only process seven transactions per second (tx/s) whereas Ethereum's fifteen tx/s is not a major improvement. Combined with the high cost of consensus and low throughput, such platforms are unusable with the mobility sector. This paper will address the latest advances in the field that aim to resolve parts of this problem as well as inform its readers about the scalability technologies that could push blockchain automotive infrastructure into the mainstream. This paper will also introduce the theoretical tools and advancements that, if implemented, could bring the mobility industry closer toward adopting efficient, scalable, and cost effective decentralized solutions.",

    "abstract": "Offchain protocols aim at bypassing the scalability and privacy limitations of classic blockchains by allowing a subset of participants to execute multiple transactions outside the blockchain. While existing solutions like payment networks and factories depend on a complex routing protocol, other solutions simply require participants to build a \\emph{childchain}, a secondary blockchain where their transactions are privately executed. Unfortunately, all childchain solutions assume either synchrony or a trusted execution environment. In this paper, we present Platypus a childchain that requires neither synchrony nor a trusted execution environment. Relieving the need for a trusted execution environment allows Platypus to ensure privacy without trusting a central authority, like Intel, that manufactures dedicated hardware chipset, like SGX. Relieving the need for synchrony means that no attacker can steal coins by leveraging clock drifts or message delays to lure timelocks. In order to prove our algorithm correct, we formalize the chilchain problem as a Byzantine variant of the classic Atomic Commit problem, where closing a childchain is equivalent to committing the whole set of payments previously recorded on the childchain ``atomically'' on the main chain. Platypus is resilience optimal and we explain how to generalize it to crosschain payments.",

Currently, there exists two major bottlenecks in managing keys; $a)$ users don't have an efficient and secure way to store their keys, $b)$ no efficient recovery mechanism exists in case the keys are lost. In this study, we propose secure methods to efficiently store and recover keys. For the first, we introduce an efficient encryption mechanism to securely encrypt and decrypt the private key using the owner's biometric signature. For the later, we introduce an efficient recovery mechanism using biometrics and secret sharing scheme.

Blockchain technology has the potential to alleviate these concerns: it can support the ability for users to control the custody of their own identifiers and credentials, enabling novel data ownership and governance models with built-in control and consent mechanisms. Hence, blockchain-based IDMSs, which could benefit both users and businesses, are beginning to proliferate.

    "abstract": "The intelligent vehicle (IV) has become a promising technology that could revolutionize our life in smart cities sooner or later. However, it yet suffers from many security vulnerabilities. Traditional security methods are incapable to secure the IV data sharing against malicious attacks. Blockchain, as expected by both research and industry communities, has emerged as a good solution to address these issues. The major issues in IV data sharing are trust, data accuracy and reliability of data sharing in the communication channel. Blockchain technology, previously working for the cryptocurrency, has recently applied to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks with similar topologies of IV data sharing. In this chapter, we present a new framework, namely biometric blockchain (BBC), for secure IV data sharing. In our new scheme, biometric information is exploited as a cue to record who is responsible in the data sharing activities, while the proposed BBC technology serves as the backbone of the IV data-sharing architecture. Hence, the proposed BBC technology provides a more reliable trust environment between the vehicles while personal identities are traceable in the proposed new scheme.",

Consistency results of Nakamoto's blockchain protocol are often expressed in a quantity $c$, which denotes the expected number of network delays before some block is mined. With $\\mu$ (resp., $\\nu$) denoting the fraction of computational power controlled by benign miners (resp., the adversary), where $\\mu + \\nu = 1$, we prove for the first time that to ensure the consistency property of Nakamoto's blockchain protocol in an asynchronous network, it suffices to have $c$ to be just slightly greater than $\\frac{2\\mu}{\\ln (\\mu/\\nu)}$. Such a result is both neater and stronger than existing ones. In the proof, we formulate novel Markov chains which characterize the numbers of mined blocks in different rounds.",

Attempts to improve transaction throughput in cryptocurrencies are usually a trade-off between throughput and security or introduce a central component. We propose Hydra, a decentralized protocol that improves transaction throughput without the security trade-off and has no central component. Our novel approach distributes blocks over multiple blockchains. Hydra makes a trade-off between transaction throughput and finality, the time it takes to stabilize the record of a transaction in the blockchain. We rigorously analyze the double spend attack in a multiple-blockchain protocol. Our analysis shows that the number of transactions per second can be increased significantly while finality is within acceptable boundaries.",

    "abstract": "Several recent transaction processing applications provide resilience using blockchain technology. At the core of such resilient blockchain designs is Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus (BFT), which enables operations during failures and malicious behavior. Unfortunately, existing BFT protocols seem unsuitable for high-throughput applications due to their high computational costs, high communication costs, high client latencies, and/or reliance on twin-paths and clients. In this paper, we present the Proof-of-Execution consensus protocol (POE) that alleviates these challenges. At the core of POE are out-of-order processing and speculative execution, which allow POE to execute transactions before consensus is reached among the replicas. With these techniques, POE manages to reduce the costs of BFT in normal cases, while guaranteeing reliable consensus for clients in all cases. We envision the use of POE in high-throughput blockchain systems. To validate this vision, we implement POE in our efficient RESILIENTDB blockchain fabric and extensively evaluate POE against several state-of-the-art BFT protocols. Our evaluation shows that POE achieves up to 80% more throughput than existing BFT protocols.",

The system is secure from attackers who cannot expend resources at a rate equivalent to that of all benign miners. But the resource requirement is arbitrary - the product of the number of minted tokens and their real value. We present Hybrid Expenditure Blockchain (HEB), a novel cryptocurrency PoW protocol that allows its designer to tune external expenditure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tunable PoW protocol. Despite the reduced resource expenditure, it maintains the security guarantees of pure PoW protocols against rational attacks. HEB has practical implications, as global power expenditure on PoW blockchains exceeds that of a medium-sized country. Applying HEB in operational PoW systems can significantly reduce their ecological footprint.",

One of the proposed panaceas is Blockchain-based DNS, which claims to solve many issues of traditional DNS. However, this does not come without security concerns and issues, as any introduction and adoption of a new technology does - let alone a disruptive one such as blockchain. In this work, we discuss a number of associated threats, including emerging ones, and we validate many of them with real-world data. In this regard, we explore a part of the blockchain DNS ecosystem in terms of the browser extensions using such technologies, the chain itself (Namecoin and Emercoin), the domains, and users which have been registered in both platforms.

Due to the immutability nature of blockchain, no change is possible on a deployed smart contract or a verified transaction. On the other hand, there are millions of dollars carried by smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain, and hence, a faulty smart contract can lead to a huge monetary loss. Therefore, it is important for smart contract developers to fully test and check the correctness of their code before deploying it on the blockchain. In this paper, we propose a testing mechanism for smart contracts in Solidity language, based on mutation testing. We analyzed a comprehensive list of known bugs in Solidity smart contracts, and designed 10 classes of mutation operators inspired by the real faults. Our experimental results show that our proposed mutation operators can regenerate 10 of 15 famous faulty smart contracts, which have resulted in millions of dollars loss. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed mutation operators in detecting real faults in Solidity smart contracts. We have also extended {\\em Universal Mutator } tool with our mutation operators, so that it can automatically generate mutants for smart contracts written in Solidity.",

At their core, these blockchain applications typically use Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols to maintain a common state across all replicas, even if some replicas are faulty or malicious. Unfortunately, existing consensus protocols are not designed to deal with geo-scale deployments in which many replicas spread across a geographically large area participate in consensus. To address this, we present the Geo-Scale Byzantine FaultTolerant consensus protocol (GeoBFT). GeoBFT is designed for excellent scalability by using a topological-aware grouping of replicas in local clusters, by introducing parallelization of consensus at the local level, and by minimizing communication between clusters. To validate our vision of high-performance geo-scale resilient distributed systems, we implement GeoBFT in our efficient ResilientDB permissioned blockchain fabric. We show that GeoBFT is not only sound and provides great scalability, but also outperforms state-of-the-art consensus protocols by a factor of six in geo-scale deployments.",

The secondary users are introduced to opportunistically access the licensed spectrum of idle operators (OPs). However, the identity privacy and data security issues raise great concerns about the secure spectrum sharing among multi-OPs. To address these challenges, a consortium blockchain trust framework is proposed for the spectrum sharing in multi-OPs wireless communication networks in this paper. A real consortium blockchain is constructed among multi-OPs. The Multi-Ops Spectrum Sharing (MOSS) smart contract is designed on the constructed consortium blockchain to implement the spectrum trading among multi-OPs. Without the need of trustless spectrum broker, the MOSS smart contract enforces multi-OPs to share the spectrum truthfully and designs a punishment mechanism to punish malicious OPs. Simulation results tested on the Remix integrated development environment (IDE) indicate the feasibility of the designed MOSS smart contract. The performance analysis of the proposed consortium blockchain trust framework demonstrates that the privacy, openness and fairness of the proposed solution are better than traditional spectrum allocation solutions.",

    "abstract": "In the second decade of the 21st century, blockchain definitely became one of the most trending computational technologies. This research aims to question the feasibility and suitability of using blockchain technology within e-voting systems, regarding both technical and non-technical aspects. In today's world, although the course of this spreading is considerably slow, several countries already use means of e-voting due to many social and economic reasons, which we further investigated. Nevertheless, the number of countries offering various e-government solutions, apart from e-voting, is significantly high. E-voting systems, naturally, require much more attention and assurance regarding potential security and anonymity issues, since voting is one of the few extremely critical governmental processes. Nevertheless, e-voting is not purely a governmental service, but many companies and nonprofit organizations would benefit the cost-efficiency, scalability, remote accessibility, and ease of use that it provides. Blockchain technology is claimed to be able to address some, obviously not all, important security concerns, including anonymity, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. The analysis results presented in this article mostly confirm these claims.",

    "abstract": "We put forward the idea that classical blockchains and smart contracts are potentially useful primitives not only for classical cryptography, but for quantum cryptography as well. Abstractly, a smart contract is a functionality that allows parties to deposit funds, and release them upon fulfillment of algorithmically checkable conditions, and can thus be employed as a formal tool to enforce monetary incentives. In this work, we give the first example of the use of smart contracts in a quantum setting. We describe a simple hybrid classical-quantum payment system whose main ingredients are a classical blockchain capable of handling stateful smart contracts, and quantum lightning, a strengthening of public-key quantum money introduced by Zhandry (Eurocrypt'19). Our hybrid payment system employs quantum states as banknotes and a classical blockchain to settle disputes and to keep track of the valid serial numbers. It has several desirable properties: it is decentralized, requiring no trust in any single entity; payments are as quick as quantum communication, regardless of the total number of users; when a quantum banknote is damaged or lost, the rightful owner can recover the lost value.",

    "abstract": "Skill verification is a central problem in workforce hiring. Companies and academia often face the difficulty of ascertaining the skills of an applicant since the certifications of the skills claimed by a candidate are generally not immediately verifiable and costly to test. Blockchains have been proposed in the literature for skill verification and tamper-proof information storage in a decentralized manner. However, most of these approaches deal with storing the certificates issued by traditional universities on the blockchain. Among the few techniques that consider the certification procedure itself, questions like (a) scalability with limited staff, (b) uniformity of grades over multiple evaluators, or (c) honest effort extraction from the evaluators are usually not addressed. We propose a blockchain-based platform named SkillCheck, which considers the questions above, and ensure several desirable properties. The platform incentivizes effort in grading via payments with tokens which it generates from the payments of the users of the platform, e.g., the recruiters and test-takers. We provide a detailed description of the design of the platform along with the provable properties of the algorithm.",

However, the security of federated learning is increasingly being questioned, due to the malicious clients or central servers' constant attack to the global model or user privacy data. To address these security issues, we proposed a decentralized federated learning framework based on blockchain, i.e., a Blockchain-based Federated Learning framework with Committee consensus (BFLC). The framework uses blockchain for the global model storage and the local model update exchange. To enable the proposed BFLC, we also devised an innovative committee consensus mechanism, which can effectively reduce the amount of consensus computing and reduce malicious attacks. We then discussed the scalability of BFLC, including theoretical security, storage optimization, and incentives. Finally, we performed experiments using real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of the BFLC framework.",

In this work, we first demonstrate that the Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain fails to scale in a sizable IoT connectivity infrastructure. To solve this problem, we present a lightweight distributed ledger scheme to integrate PoW blockchain into IoT. In our scheme, we classify transactions into two types: 1) global transactions, which must be processed by global blockchain nodes and 2) local transactions, which can be processed locally by entities called witnesses. Performance evaluation demonstrates that our proposed scheme improves the scalability of integrated blockchain and IoT monitoring systems by processing a fraction of the transactions, inversely proportional to the number of witnesses, locally. Hence, reducing the number of global transactions.",

However, the typically small number of privacy peers enable single adversaries to mimic distributed services. We thus present AnonBoot, a Sybil-resistant medium to securely bootstrap distributed anonymity services via public blockchains. AnonBoot enforces that peers periodically create a small proof of work to refresh their eligibility for providing secure anonymity services. A pseudo-random, locally replicable bootstrapping process using on-chain entropy then prevents biasing the election of eligible peers. Our evaluation using Bitcoin as AnonBoot's underlying blockchain shows its feasibility to maintain a trustworthy repository of 1000 peers with only a small storage footprint while supporting arbitrarily large user bases on top of most blockchains.",

    "abstract": "Game theory is often used as a tool to analyze decentralized systems and their properties, in particular, blockchains. In this note, we take the opposite view. We argue that blockchains can and should be used to implement economic mechanisms because they can help to overcome problems that occur if trust in the mechanism designer cannot be assumed. Mechanism design deals with the allocation of resources to agents, often by extracting private information from them. Some mechanisms are immune to early information disclosure, while others may heavily depend on it. Some mechanisms have to randomize to achieve fairness and efficiency. Both issues, information disclosure, and randomness require trust in the mechanism designer. If there is no trust, mechanisms can be manipulated. We claim that mechanisms that use randomness or sequential information disclosure are much harder, if not impossible, to audit. Therefore, centralized implementation is often not a good solution. We consider some of the most frequently used mechanisms in practice and identify circumstances under which manipulation is possible. We propose a decentralized implementation of such mechanisms, that can be, in practical terms, realized by blockchain technology. Moreover, we argue in which environments a decentralized implementation of a mechanism brings a significant advantage.",

However, many industry-relevant use cases require the ability to delete data, especially when personally identifiable information is stored or when data growth has to be constrained. Existing attempts to reconcile these contradictions compromise on core qualities of the blockchain paradigm, as they include backdoor-like approaches such as central authorities with elevated rights or usage of specialized chameleon hash algorithms in chaining of the blocks. In this technical report, we outline a novel architecture for the blockchain ledger and consensus, which uses a tree of context chains with simultaneous validity. A context chain captures the transactions of a closed group of entities and persons, thus structuring blocks in a precisely defined way. The resulting context isolation enables consensus-steered deletion of an entire context without side effects to other contextes. This architecture opens the possibility of truncation, data rollover and separation of concerns, and can help to fulfill the GDPR regulations.",

Nonetheless, one open challenge of this emerging paradigm lies in the potential security issues on edge nodes and end devices, e.g., sensors and controllers. This paper proposes a cooperative protocol, namely DEAN, across edge nodes to prevent data manipulation, and to allow fair data sharing with quick recovery under resource constraints of limited storage, computing, and network capacity. Specifically, DEAN leverages a parallel mechanism equipped with three independent core components, effectively achieving low resource consumption while allowing secured parallel block processing on edge nodes. We have implemented a system prototype based on DEAN and experimentally verified its effectiveness with a comparison with three popular blockchain implementations: Ethereum, Parity, and Hyperledger Fabric. Experimental results show that the system prototype exhibits high resilience to arbitrary failures: the percentile of trusty nodes is much higher than the required 50\\% in most cases. Performance-wise, DEAN-based blockchain implementation outperforms the state-of-the-art blockchain systems with up to $25\\times$ higher throughput and $18\\times$ lower latency on 1,000 nodes.",

In this paper, we propose tree-chain a scalable fast blockchain instantiation that introduces two levels of randomization among the validators: i) transaction level where the validator of each transaction is selected randomly based on the most significant characters of the hash function output (known as consensus code), and ii) blockchain level where validator is randomly allocated to a particular consensus code based on the hash of their public key. Tree-chain introduces parallel chain branches where each validator commits the corresponding transactions in a unique ledger. Implementation results show that tree-chain is runnable on low resource devices and incurs low processing overhead, achieving near real-time transaction settlement.",

For demonstrating the applicability of our approach, we develop a functional set of smart contracts and a local private blockchain. The benefits of our framework are further discussed, along with fruitful areas for future research.",

    "abstract": "As the digitization of information-intensive processes gains momentum in nowadays, the concern is growing about how to deal with the ever-growing problem of cybercrime. To this end, law enforcement officials and security firms use sophisticated digital forensics techniques for analyzing and investigating cybercrimes. However, multi-jurisdictional mandates, interoperability issues, the massive amount of evidence gathered (multimedia, text etc.) and multiple stakeholders involved (law enforcement agencies, security firms etc.) are just a few among the various challenges that hinder the adoption and implementation of sound digital forensics schemes. Blockchain technology has been recently proposed as a viable solution for developing robust digital forensics mechanisms. In this paper, we provide an overview and classification of the available blockchain-based digital forensic tools, and we further describe their main features. We also offer a thorough analysis of the various benefits and challenges of the symbiotic relationship between blockchain technology and the current digital forensics approaches, as proposed in the available literature. Based on the findings, we identify various research gaps, and we suggest future research directions that are expected to be of significant value both for academics and practitioners in the field of digital forensics.",

    "abstract": "Derivatives are a special type of financial contracts used to hedge risks or to speculate on the market fluctuations. In order to avoid ambiguities and misinterpretations, several domain specific languages (DSLs) for specifying such derivatives have been proposed. The recent development of the blockchain technologies enables the automatic execution of financial derivatives. Once deployed on the blockchain, a derivative cannot be modified. Therefore, more caution should be taken in order to avoid undesired situations. In this paper, we address the formal verification of financial derivatives written in a DSL for blockchain, called Findel. We identify a list of properties that, once proved, they exclude several security vulnerabilities (e.g., immutable bugs, money losses). We develop an infrastructure that provides means to interactively formalize and prove such properties. To provide a higher confidence, we also generate proof certificates. We use our infrastructure to certify non-trivial examples that cover the most common types of derivatives (forwards/futures, swaps, options).",

One of the major concerns with the IoT systems is the lack of privacy and security preserving schemes for controlling access and ensuring the security of the data. A majority of security issues arise because of the centralized architecture of IoT systems. Another concern is the lack of proper authentication and access control schemes to moderate access to information generated by the IoT devices. So the question that arises is how to ensure the identity of the equipment or the communicating node. The answer to secure operations in a trustless environment brings us to the decentralized solution of Blockchain. A lot of research has been going on in the area of convergence of IoT and Blockchain, and it has resulted in some remarkable progress in addressing some of the significant issues in the IoT arena. This work reviews the challenges and threats in the IoT environment and how integration with Blockchain can resolve some of them.",

The integration of such a variety of MEC services in a inherently distributed architecture requires a robust system for managing hardware resources, balancing the network load and securing the distributed applications. Blockchain technology has emerged a solution for managing MEC services, with consensus protocols and data integrity checks that enable transparent and efficient distributed decision-making. In addition to transparency, the benefits from a security point of view are evident. Nonetheless, blockchain technology faces significant challenges in terms of scalability. In this chapter, we review existing consensus protocols and scalability techniques in both well-established and next-generation blockchain architectures. From this, we evaluate the most suitable solutions for managing MEC services and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the available alternatives.",

The distributed resources in the form of edge servers are expected to collaborate with each other in order to boost overall performance of a MEC system. However, there are many challenges to adopt global collaboration among the edge computing server entities among which the following two are significant: ensuring trust among the servers and developing a unified scheme to enable real-time collaboration and task sharing. In this article, a blockchain framework is proposed to provide a trusted collaboration mechanism between edge servers in a MEC environment. In particular, a permissioned blockchain scheme is investigated to support a trusted design that also provides incentives for collaboration. Finally, Caliper tool and Hyperledger Fabric benchmarks are used to conduct an experimental evaluation of the proposed blockchain scheme embedded in a MEC framework.",

Similar to any other contractual method, an SLA is not immune to breaches. Ideally, an SLA stipulates consequences (e.g. penalties) imposed on cloud providers when they fail to conform to SLA terms. The current practice assumes trust in service providers to acknowledge SLA breach incidents and executing associated consequences. Recently, the Blockchain paradigm has introduced compelling capabilities that may enable us to address SLA enforcement more elegantly. This paper proposes and implements a blockchain-based approach for assessing SLA compliance and enforcing consequences. It employs a diagnostic accuracy method for validating the dependability of the proposed solution.

A safe smart contract implementation should ensure that each participant can always append a contract transaction to the blockchain in order move the contract towards secure completion. To this goal, we propose Bitcoin Trace-Net, a contract verification framework which generates an executable symbolic model from the underlying contract implementation. A Trace-Net model consists of a Petri Net formalism enriched with a Dolev-Yao-like actor knowledge model. The explicit symbolic actor knowledge model supports the verification of contracts featuring cryptographic sub-protocols, which may not be observable on the blockchain. Trace-Net is sufficiently expressive to accurately model blockchain semantics such as the delay between a transaction broadcast and its subsequent confirmation, as well as adversarial blockchain reorganizations of finite depths, both of which can break smart contract safety. As an implementation level framework, Trace-Net can be instantiated at run-time to monitor and verify smart contract protocol executions.",

Specifically, in this paper, we carry out an analysis in terms of quantifying the risk associated to an operational multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-markets (BSMD). We conduct an actor-based analysis to determine the impact of the attacks. The analysis identified five attack goals and five types of attackers that violate the security of the blockchain system. In the case study of the public permissioned BSMD, we highlight the highest risk factors according to their impact on the victims in terms of monetary, privacy, integrity and trust. Four attack goals represent a risk in terms of economic losses and one attack goal contains many threats that represent a risk that is either unacceptable or undesirable.",

However, increasing automation and connectedness broadens the attack surface and heightens the likelihood of a malicious entity successfully executing an attack. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain based Framework for sEcuring smaRt vehicLes (B-FERL). B-FERL uses permissioned blockchain technology to tailor information access to restricted entities in the connected vehicle ecosystem. It also uses a challenge-response data exchange between the vehicles and roadside units to monitor the internal state of the vehicle to identify cases of in-vehicle network compromise. In order to enable authentic and valid communication in the vehicular network, only vehicles with a verifiable record in the blockchain can exchange messages. Through qualitative arguments, we show that B-FERL is resilient to identified attacks. Also, quantitative evaluations in an emulated scenario show that B-FERL ensures a suitable response time and required storage size compatible with realistic scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate how B-FERL achieves various important functions relevant to the automotive ecosystem such as trust management, vehicular forensics and secure vehicular networks.",

We show that previous blockchain based privacy protection approaches offer protection, but give the control of the data to (potentially not trustworthy) third parties, which also can be considered a privacy violation.

    "abstract": "Sharding is a promising blockchain scaling solution. But it currently suffers from high latency and low throughput when it comes to cross-shard transactions, i.e., transactions that require coordination from multiple shards. The root cause of these limitations arise from the use of the classic two-phase commit protocol, which involves locking assets for extended periods of time. This paper presents Rivet, a new paradigm for blockchain sharding that achieves lower latency and higher throughput for cross-shard transactions. Rivet has a single reference shard running consensus, and multiple worker shards maintaining disjoint states and processing a subset of transactions in the system. Rivet obviates the need for consensus within each worker shard, and as a result, tolerates more failures within a shard and lowers communication overhead. We prove the correctness and security of Rivet. We also propose a more realistic framework for evaluating sharded blockchains by creating a benchmark based on real Ethereum transactions. An evaluation of our prototype implementation of Rivet and the baseline two-phase commit, atop 50+ AWS EC2 instances, using our evaluation framework demonstrates the latency and throughput improvements for cross-shard transactions.",

On the other hand, blockchain systems routinely perform a huge amount of computation that does not achieve practical purposes in order to build Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus from decentralized participants. In this paper, we propose a new consensus mechanism, Proof of Learning (PoLe), which directs the computation spent for consensus toward optimization of neural networks (NN). In our mechanism, the training/testing data are released to the entire blockchain network (BCN) and the consensus nodes train NN models on the data, which serves as the proof of learning. When the consensus on the BCN considers a NN model to be valid, a new block is appended to the blockchain. We experimentally compare the PoLe protocol with Proof of Work (PoW) and show that PoLe can achieve a more stable block generation rate, which leads to more efficient transaction processing. We also introduce a novel cheating prevention mechanism, Secure Mapping Layer (SML), which can be straightforwardly implemented as a linear NN layer. Empirical evaluation shows that SML can detect cheating nodes at small cost to the predictive performance.",

    "abstract": "Large scale power systems are comprised of regional utilities with IIoT enabled assets that stream sensor readings in real time. In order to detect cyberattacks, the globally acquired, real time sensor data needs to be analyzed in a centralized fashion. However, owing to operational constraints, such a centralized sharing mechanism turns out to be a major obstacle. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based decentralized framework for detecting coordinated replay attacks with full privacy of sensor data. We develop a Bayesian inference mechanism employing locally reported attack probabilities that is tailor made for a blockchain framework. We compare our framework to a traditional decentralized algorithm based on the broadcast gossip framework both theoretically as well as empirically. With the help of experiments on a private Ethereum blockchain, we show that our approach achieves good detection quality and significantly outperforms gossip driven approaches in terms of accuracy, timeliness and scalability.",

Different from existing efforts that focus on the blockchain system factors such as block size, network propagation delay or block generation speed, in this paper we explore a new key dimension of computing power from the miners' perspective. Specifically, we first propose a detailed mathematical model to characterize the impact of computing power competition of the mining pools on the temporary fork. We also derive closed-form formula of the probability of temporary fork and the expected mining reward of a mining pool. To reveal the long-term trends on the computing power distributions over the competing mining pools, we then develop an evolutionary game framework based on the temporary fork modeling and accordingly characterize the set of stable evolution equilibriums. Both extensive numerical simulations and realistic blockchain data based evaluation provide evidence to support our theoretical models and discoveries.",

Moreover, epos leverages the in-built system operations to promote fair mining practices by penalizing malicious entities. We validate epos's achievable objectives through theoretical analysis and simulations.

    "abstract": "We design and implement the first private and anonymous decentralized crowdsourcing system ZebraLancer, and overcome two fundamental challenges of decentralizing crowdsourcing, i.e., data leakage and identity breach. First, our outsource-then-prove methodology resolves the tension between the blockchain transparency and the data confidentiality to guarantee the basic utilities/fairness requirements of data crowdsourcing, thus ensuring: (i) a requester will not pay more than what data deserve, according to a policy announced when her task is published via the blockchain; (ii) each worker indeed gets a payment based on the policy, if he submits data to the blockchain; (iii) the above properties are realized not only without a central arbiter, but also without leaking the data to the open blockchain. Second, the transparency of blockchain allows one to infer private information about workers and requesters through their participation history. Simply enabling anonymity is seemingly attempting but will allow malicious workers to submit multiple times to reap rewards. ZebraLancer also overcomes this problem by allowing anonymous requests/submissions without sacrificing accountability. The idea behind is a subtle linkability: if a worker submits twice to a task, anyone can link the submissions, or else he stays anonymous and unlinkable across tasks. To realize this delicate linkability, we put forward a novel cryptographic concept, i.e., the common-prefix-linkable anonymous authentication. We remark the new anonymous authentication scheme might be of independent interest. Finally, we implement our protocol for a common image annotation task and deploy it in a test net of Ethereum. The experiment results show the applicability of our protocol atop the existing real-world blockchain.",

Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain platforms that require \"smart-contracts\" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.",

    "abstract": "Although blockchains aim for immutability as their core feature, several instances have exposed the harms with perfect immutability. The permanence of illicit content inserted in Bitcoin poses a challenge to law enforcement agencies like Interpol, and millions of dollars are lost in buggy smart contracts in Ethereum. A line of research then spawned on Redactable blockchains with the aim of solving the problem of redacting illicit contents from both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. However, all the existing proposals follow the build-new-chain approach for redactions, and cannot be integrated with existing systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum. We present Reparo, a generic protocol that acts as a publicly verifiable layer on top of any blockchain to perform repairs, ranging from fixing buggy contracts to removing illicit contents from the chain. Reparo facilitates additional functionalities for blockchains while maintaining the same provable security guarantee; thus, Reparo can be integrated with existing blockchains and start performing repairs on the pre-existent data. Any system user may propose a repair and a deliberation process ensues resulting in a decision that complies with the repair policy of the chain and is publicly verifiable. Our Reparo layer can be easily tailored to different consensus requirements, does not require heavy cryptographic machinery and can, therefore, be efficiently instantiated in any permission-ed or -less setting. We demonstrate it by giving efficient instantiations of Reparo on top of Ethereum (with PoS and PoW), Bitcoin, and Cardano. Moreover, we evaluate Reparo with Ethereum mainnet and show that the cost of fixing several prominent smart contract bugs is almost negligible. For instance, the cost of repairing the prominent Parity Multisig wallet bug with Reparo is as low as 0.000000018% of the Ethers that can be retrieved after the fix.",

    "abstract": "Many recent social media posts and news may create a perception of big success in the use of blockchain for the real estate industry, land registration and protection of titles and property rights. A sobering outlook is crucial because misleading concepts may bury the whole idea of blockchain use. The paper aims to research the possibilities of blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and applicability of these technologies for different purposes in real estate, property rights and public registries. Blockchain, which is distinguished from permissioned systems as the technology of the immutable ledger that does not require authorities, is a new word in governance. However, this technology has some principal features that can restrain its implementation at the state level, and thus require further research and development. The application of blockchain requires a proper architecture of overlaid technologies to support changes of outdated and mistaken data, address issues of digital identity and privacy, legal compliance and enforceability of smart contracts and scalability of the ledger. This paper shows the constraints of the technology's properties which were not explained before in the context of title rights and land registration even though technological limits are known in more specific technical sources. Along with the known benefits this meant to help to avoid misinterpretation of some DLT features by non-technical people. A multidisciplinary approach in analysing the technology and laws helped to better understand what can and cannot be beneficial for public registries and the protection of property rights. The presented outcomes can be laid down as requirements for the technical protocols aimed at addressing the issues of DLT and public policies to put blockchain at the service of society.",

    "abstract": "First-generation blockchains provide probabilistic finality: a block can be revoked, albeit the probability decreases as the block sinks deeper into the chain. Recent proposals revisited committee-based BFT consensus to provide deterministic finality: as soon as a block is validated, it is never revoked. A distinguishing characteristic of these second-generation blockchains over classical BFT protocols is that committees change over time as the participation and the blockchain state evolve. In this paper, we push forward in this direction by proposing a formalization of the Dynamic Repeated Consensus problem and by providing generic procedures to solve it in the context of blockchains. Our approach is modular in that one can plug in different synchronizers and single-shot consensus instances. To offer a complete solution, we provide a concrete instantiation, called Tenderbake, and present a blockchain synchronizer and a single-shot consensus algorithm, working in a Byzantine and partially synchronous system model with eventually synchronous clocks. In contrast to recent proposals, our methodology is driven by the need to bound the message buffers. This is essential in preventing spamming and run-time memory errors. Moreover, Tenderbake processes can synchronize with each other without exchanging messages, leveraging instead the information stored in the blockchain.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain, the technology behind the popular Bitcoin, is considered a \"security by design\" system as it is meant to create security among a group of distrustful parties yet without a central trusted authority. The security of blockchain relies on the premise of honest-majority, namely, the blockchain system is assumed to be secure as long as the majority of consensus voting power is honest. And in the case of proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, adversaries cannot control more than 50% of the network's gross computing power. However, this 50% threshold is based on the analysis of computing power only, with implicit and idealistic assumptions on the network and node behavior. Recent researches have alluded that factors such as network connectivity, presence of blockchain forks, and mining strategy could undermine the consensus security assured by the honest-majority, but neither concrete analysis nor quantitative evaluation is provided. In this paper we fill the gap by proposing an analytical model to assess the impact of network connectivity on the consensus security of PoW blockchain under different adversary models. We apply our analytical model to two adversarial scenarios: 1) honest-but-potentially-colluding, 2) selfish mining. For each scenario, we quantify the communication capability of nodes involved in a fork race and estimate the adversary's mining revenue and its impact on security properties of the consensus protocol. Simulation results validated our analysis. Our modeling and analysis provide a paradigm for assessing the security impact of various factors in a distributed consensus system.",

As applications, the general existence results for consensus equilibria of Gap games are established, which not only help us to claim the existence for the general stability for Gap games under the general framework of Blockchain ecosystems, but also allow us to illustrate a number of different phenomenon on the study of mining-pool games with possible impacts due to miners's gap behaviors with scenarios embedded n Bitcoin economics.

This specification though ground breaking, misses some important blockchain requirements and does not fully consider the requirements of Ethereum Clients offering Private Sidechain capabilities. This paper presents the case for Private Sidechains and defines requirements to be complied with to deliver this technology. The capabilities of three blockchain clients have been analysed based on the requirements: Quorum, Parity, and Hyperledger Fabric. Quorum and Hyperledger Fabric operate as private consortium blockchains where as Parity delivers private transaction capabilities on top of Ethereum MainNet. These differing approaches has led to different strengths and weaknesses which has resulted in each client not complying with one or more key requirement. In particular, none of the reviewed blockchain clients support the ability to determine bootstrap information to establish on-demand blockchains and none of the clients support secure management and pinning from Ethereum MainNet. This paper presents Ethereum Private Sidechains and a range of technologies which allow it to deliver on complex sidechain requirements. Ethereum Registration Authorities are presented, which allow entities which have not previously interacted to securely obtain information to bootstrap a sidechain, and a Management and Pinning strategy is described which allows the state of a sidechain to be securely pinned to Ethereum MainNet without compromising privacy.",

For instance, in 2015, MIT introduced a schema for the publication of their academic certificates based on this principle. In this work, we propose a way for users to obtain assured identities based on face-to-face proofing that can then be validated against a record on a blockchain. Moreover, in order to provide anonymity, instead of storing a hash, we make use of a scheme of Brands to store a commitment against which one can perform zero-knowledge proofs of identity. We also enforce the confidentiality of the underlying data by letting users control a secret of their own. We show how our schema can be implemented on Bitcoin's blockchain and how to save bandwidth by grouping commitments using Merkle trees to minimize the number of Bitcoin transactions that need to be sent. Finally, we describe a system in which users can gain access to services thanks to the identity records of our proposal.",

Thus, the development of blockchain in mobile applications is restricted. In this paper, we consider the edge computing as the network enabler for mobile blockchain. In particular, we study optimal pricing-based edge computing resource management to support mobile blockchain applications where the mining process can be offloaded to an Edge computing Service Provider (ESP). We adopt a two-stage Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the profit of the ESP and the individual utilities of different miners. In Stage I, the ESP sets the price of edge computing services. In Stage II, the miners decide on the service demand to purchase based on the observed prices. We apply the backward induction to analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium in each stage for uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. Further, the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg game are validated for both pricing schemes. At last, the performance evaluation shows that the ESP intends to set the maximum possible value as the optimal price for profit maximization under uniform pricing. In addition, the discriminatory pricing helps the ESP encourage higher total service demand from miners and achieve greater profit correspondingly.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has recently been applied in many applications such as bitcoin, smart grid, and Internet of Things (IoT) as a public ledger of transactions. However, the use of blockchain in mobile environments is still limited because the mining process consumes too much computing and energy resources on mobile devices. Edge computing offered by the Edge Computing Service Provider can be adopted as a viable solution for offloading the mining tasks from the mobile devices, i.e., miners, in the mobile blockchain environment. However, a mechanism needs to be designed for edge resource allocation to maximize the revenue for the Edge Computing Service Provider and to ensure incentive compatibility and individual rationality is still open. In this paper, we develop an optimal auction based on deep learning for the edge resource allocation. Specifically, we construct a multi-layer neural network architecture based on an analytical solution of the optimal auction. The neural networks first perform monotone transformations of the miners' bids. Then, they calculate allocation and conditional payment rules for the miners. We use valuations of the miners as the data training to adjust parameters of the neural networks so as to optimize the loss function which is the expected, negated revenue of the Edge Computing Service Provider. We show the experimental results to confirm the benefits of using the deep learning for deriving the optimal auction for mobile blockchain with high revenue",

    "abstract": "The blockchain initially gained traction in 2008 as the technology underlying bitcoin, but now has been employed in a diverse range of applications and created a global market worth over $150B as of 2017. What distinguishes blockchains from traditional distributed databases is the ability to operate in a decentralized setting without relying on a trusted third party. As such their core technical component is consensus: how to reach agreement among a group of nodes. This has been extensively studied already in the distributed systems community for closed systems, but its application to open blockchains has revitalized the field and led to a plethora of new designs. The inherent complexity of consensus protocols and their rapid and dramatic evolution makes it hard to contextualize the design landscape. We address this challenge by conducting a systematic and comprehensive study of blockchain consensus protocols. After first discussing key themes in classical consensus protocols, we describe: first protocols based on proof-of-work (PoW), second proof-of-X (PoX) protocols that replace PoW with more energy-efficient alternatives, and third hybrid protocols that are compositions or variations of classical consensus protocols. We develop a framework to evaluate their performance, security and design properties, and use it to systematize key themes in the protocol categories described above. This evaluation leads us to identify research gaps and challenges for the community to consider in future research endeavours.",

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art mobile edge applications are generating intense traffic and posing rigorous latency requirements to service providers. While resource sharing across multiple service providers can be a way to maximize the utilization of limited resources at the network edge, it requires a centralized repository maintained by all parties for service providers to share status. Moreover, service providers have to trust each other for resource allocation fairness, which is difficult because of potential conflicts of interest. We propose EdgeChain, a blockchain-based architecture to make mobile edge application placement decisions for multiple service providers. We first formulate a stochastic programming problem minimizing the placement cost for mobile edge application placement scenarios. Based on our model, we present a heuristic mobile edge application placement algorithm. As a decentralized public ledger, the blockchain then takes the logic of our algorithm as the smart contract, with the consideration of resources from all mobile edge hosts participating in the system. The algorithm is agreed by all parties and the results will only be accepted by majority of the mining nodes on the blockchain. When a placement decision is made, an edge host meeting the consumer's latency and budget requirements will be selected at the lowest cost. All placement transactions are stored on the blockchain and are traceable by every mobile edge service provider and application vendor who consumes resources at the mobile edge.",

The code can be written in different languages with the common purpose of implementing various kinds of transactions onto the hosting blockchain, They are ruled by the blockchain infrastructure and work in order to satisfy conditions typical of traditional contracts. The software code must satisfy constrains strongly context dependent which are quite different from traditional software code. In particular, since the bytecode is uploaded in the hosting blockchain, size, computational resources, interaction between different parts of software are all limited and even if the specific software languages implement more or less the same constructs of traditional languages there is not the same freedom as in normal software development. SC software is expected to reflect these constrains on SC software metrics which should display metric values characteristic of the domain and different from more traditional software metrics. We tested this hypothesis on the code of more than twelve thousands SC written in Solidity and uploaded on the Ethereum blockchain. We downloaded the SC from a public repository and computed the statistics of a set of software metrics related to SC and compared them to the metrics extracted from more traditional software projects. Our results show that generally Smart Contracts metrics have ranges more restricted than the corresponding metrics in traditional software systems. Some of the stylized facts, like power law in the tail of the distribution of some metrics, are only approximate but the lines of code follow a log normal distribution which reminds of the same behavior already found in traditional software systems.",

Unfortunately, when such a permissioned blockchain runs in a large scale on the Internet, these explicit committee nodes can be easily turned down by denial-of-service (DoS) or network partition attacks. Although work proposes scalable BFT protocols that run on a larger number of committee nodes, their efficiency drops dramatically when only a small number of nodes are attacked. In this paper, our EGES protocol leverages Intel SGX to develop a new abstraction called \"stealth committee\", which effectively hides the committee nodes into a large pool of fake committee nodes. EGES selects a distinct group of stealth committee for each block and confirms the same sequence of blocks among all nodes with overwhelming probability. Evaluation on typical geo-distributed settings shows that: (1)EGES is the first permissioned blockchain's consensus protocol that can tolerate tough DoS and network partition attacks; and (2) EGES achieves comparable throughput and latency as existing permissioned blockchains' protocols",

Parties involved in the transaction maintain a multi-signature fraud-proof off-chain replicated state machine, and only resort to on-chain consensus when absolutely necessary (e.g., when two parties disagree on a state). Off-chain scaling is the only way to support fully scale-out decentralized applications (\"dApps\") with better privacy and no compromise on the trust and decentralization guarantees. It is the inflection point for blockchain mass adoption, and will be the engine behind all scalable dApps. Celer Network is an Internet-scale, trust-free, and privacy-preserving platform where everyone can quickly build, operate, and use highly scalable dApps. It is not a standalone blockchain but a networked system running on top of existing and future blockchains. It provides unprecedented performance and flexibility through innovation in off-chain scaling techniques and incentive-aligned cryptoeconomics. Celer Network embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual component, including a generalized state channel and sidechain suite that supports fast and generic off-chain state transitions; a provably optimal value transfer routing mechanism that achieves an order of magnitude higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions; a powerful development framework and runtime for off-chain applications; and a new cryptoeconomic model that provides network effect, stable liquidity, and high availability for the off-chain ecosystem.",

Crowdsourcing network coverage, combined with crowdfunding costs, can create economically sustainable yet decentralized Internet access. This means every participant can invest in resources, and pay or be paid for usage to recover the costs of network devices and maintenance. While mesh networks and mesh routing protocols enable self-organized networks that expand organically, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts enable the economic coordination among network providers and consumers. We explore and evaluate two existing blockchain software stacks, Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) and Ethereum geth with Proof of Authority (PoA) intended as a local lightweight distributed ledger, deployed in a real city-wide production mesh network and also in laboratory network. We quantify the performance, bottlenecks and identify the current limitations and opportunities for improvement to serve locally the needs of wireless mesh networks, without the privacy and economic cost of relying on public blockchains.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains are distributed secure ledgers to which transactions are issued continuously and each block of transactions is tightly coupled to its predecessors. Permissioned blockchains place special emphasis on transactions throughput. In this paper we present FireLedger, which leverages the iterative nature of blockchains in order to improve their throughput in optimistic execution scenarios. FireLedger trades latency for throughput in the sense that in FireLedger the last f + 1 blocks of each node's blockchain are considered tentative, i.e., they may be rescinded in case one of the last f + 1 blocks proposers was Byzantine. Yet, when optimistic assumptions are met, a new block is decided in each communication step, which consists of a proposer that sends only its proposal and all other participants are sending a single bit each. Our performance study demonstrates that in a single Amazon data-center, FireLedger running on 10 mid-range Amazon nodes obtains a throughput of up to 160K transactions per second for (typical Bitcoin size) 512 bytes transactions. In a 10 nodes Amazon geo-distributed setting with 512 bytes transactions, FireLedger obtains a throughput of 30K tps. Moreover, on higher end Amazon machines, FireLedger obtains $20%-600%$ better throughput than state of the art protocols like HotStuff and BFT-SMaRt, depending on the exact configuration.",

    "abstract": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives control of personal data back to the owners by appointing higher requirements and obligations on service providers who manage and process personal data. As the verification of GDPR-compliance, handled by a supervisory authority, is irregularly conducted; it is challenging to be certified that a service provider has been continuously adhering to the GDPR. Furthermore, it is beyond the data owner's capability to perceive whether a service provider complies with the GDPR and effectively protects her personal data. This motivates us to envision a design concept for developing a GDPR-compliant personal data management platform leveraging the emerging blockchain and smart contract technologies. The goals of the platform are to provide decentralised mechanisms to both service providers and data owners for processing personal data; meanwhile, empower data provenance and transparency by leveraging advanced features of the blockchain technology. The platform enables data owners to impose data usage consent, ensures only designated parties can process personal data, and logs all data activities in an immutable distributed ledger using smart contract and cryptography techniques. By honestly participating in the platform, a service provider can be endorsed by the blockchain network that it is fully GDPR-compliant; otherwise, any violation is immutably recorded and is easily figured out by associated parties. We then demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed design concept by developing a profile management platform implemented on top of the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain framework, following by valuable analysis and discussion.",

Unlike existing protocols, the ContractChecker uniquely delegates log auditing to the Blockchain, and has the advantages in reducing client cost and lowering requirements on client availability, lending itself to modern scenarios with mobile and web clients. The ContractChecker collects the logs from both clients and the cloud server, and verifies the consistency by cross-checking the logs. By this means, it does not only detects the attacks from malicious clients and server forging their logs, but also is able to mitigate those attacks and recover the system from them. In addition, we design new attacks against ContractChecker exploiting various limits in real Blockchain systems (e.g., write unavailability, Blockchain forks, contract race conditions). We analyze and harden the security of ContractChecker protocols against the proposed new attacks. For evaluating the cost, we build a functional prototype of the ContractChecker on Ethereum/Solidity. By experiments on private and public Ethereum testnets, we extensively evaluate the cost of the ContractChecker in comparison with that of existing client-based log auditing works. The result shows the ContractChecker can scale to hundreds of clients and save client costs by more than one order of magnitude.",

To address the efficiency problem of on-chain contract execution and to prevent exposing private data on the publicly viewable blockchain, PrivacyGuard incorporates a novel TEE-based off-chain contract execution engine along with a protocol to securely commit the execution result onto blockchain.

Moreover, the existing schemes are centralized and vulnerable to the bottleneck of the single point of failure and data breaches. In this paper, we propose a distributed privacy-preserving smart parking system using blockchain. A consortium blockchain created by different parking lot owners to ensure security, transparency, and availability is proposed to store their parking offers on the blockchain. To preserve drivers' location privacy, we adopt private information retrieval (PIR) technique to enable drivers to retrieve parking offers from blockchain nodes privately, without revealing which parking offers are retrieved. Furthermore, a short randomizable signature is used to enable drivers to reserve available parking slots in an anonymous manner. Besides, we introduce an anonymous payment system that cannot link drivers' to specific parking locations. Our performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can preserve drivers' privacy with low communication and computation overhead.",

The algorithm uses a public ledger (Blockchain) that contains nodes position and the list of their neighbor nodes. This ledger is shared among the IoT devices. Once an IoT device is localized its new position and the list of neighbor nodes are added to the Blockchain. This shared localization data will be used later by other IoT devices for their localization process. To avoid the attack where a malicious node sends a fake position, the correctness of the claimed position are verified before adding it to the Blockchain. Moreover, data exchanged between nodes (IoT devices) are signed to guarantee their authenticity and integrity. The integration of these security mechanisms into the localization process permits to exclude false data and therefore reduces the localization error. The simulation results show that adding the proposed security mechanism improves the localization accuracy of the algorithm when running in the presence of malicious nodes.",

In a cross-site genomic data sharing system, a secure and transparent access control audit module plays an essential role in ensuring the accountability. The 2018 iDASH competition first track provides us with an opportunity to design efficient logging and querying system for cross-site genomic dataset access audit. We designed a blockchain-based log system which can provide a light-weight and widely compatible module for existing blockchain platforms. The submitted solution won the third place of the competition. In this paper, we report the technical details in our system. Methods: We present two methods: baseline method and enhanced method. We started with the baseline method and then adjusted our implementation based on the competition evaluation criteria and characteristics of the log system. To overcome obstacles of indexing on the immutable Blockchain system, we designed a hierarchical timestamp structure which supports efficient range queries on the timestamp field. Results: We implemented our methods in Python3, tested the scalability, and compared the performance using the test data supplied by competition organizer. We successfully boosted the log retrieval speed for complex AND queries that contain multiple predicates. For the range query, we boosted the speed for at least one order of magnitude. The storage usage is reduced by 25%. Conclusion: We demonstrate that Blockchain can be used to build a time and space efficient log and query genomic dataset audit trail. Therefore, it provides a promising solution for sharing genomic data with accountability requirement across multiple sites.",

Other than simply encrypting data into keys, in this paper, we proposed a protocol called Biometric Blockchain (BBC) that explicitly incorporate the biometric cues of individuals to unambiguously identify the creators and users in a blockchain-based system, particularly to address the increasing needs to secure the food logistics, following the recently widely reported incident on wrongly labelled foods that caused the death of a customer on a flight. The advantage of using BBC in the food logistics is clear: it can not only identify if the data or labels are authentic, but also clearly record who is responsible for the secured data or labels. As a result, such a BBC-based solution can great ease the difficulty to control the risks accompanying the food logistics, such as faked foods or wrong gradient labels.",

Online mapping is one of the fundamental services offered in smart cities which enables the vehicle owners to find shortest or fastest direction toward a destination thus reduces travel cost and air pollution. However, existing online mapping services rely on centralized servers, e.g., Google, which collect data from users to offer service. This method is unlikely to scale with growth in the smart city participants and introduces privacy concerns and data wall where data of the users is managed by big companies. To address these challenges, in this paper we introduce DMap, a blockchain-based platform where the users can share data in an anonymous distributed manner with service providers. To the best of our knowledge, DMap is the first distributed blockchain-based solution for online mapping. To improve the scalability of the blockchain, we propose to use edge-computing along with blockchain. To protect against malicious vehicles that may inject false data, we define a reputation system where the collected data of the vehicles is verified by monitoring the neighbor data.

    "abstract": "Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) have been proposed as an alternative solution to the current centralized Online Social Networks (OSNs). Online Social Networks are based on centralized architecture (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Google+), while DOSNs do not have a service provider that acts as central authority and users have more control over their information. Several DOSNs have been proposed during the last years. However, the decentralization of the OSN requires efficient solutions for protecting the privacy of users, and to evaluate the trust between users. Blockchain represents a disruptive technology which has been applied to several fields, among these also to Social Networks. In this paper, we propose a manageable, user-driven and auditable access control framework for DOSNs using blockchain technology. In the proposed approach, the blockchain is used as a support for the definition of privacy policies. The resource owner uses the public key of the subject to define flexible role-based access control policies, while the private key associated with the subject's Ethereum account is used to decrypt the private data once access permission is validated on the blockchain. We evaluate our solution by exploiting the Rinkeby Ethereum testnet to deploy the smart contract, and to evaluate its performance. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed scheme in achieving auditable and user-driven access control via smart contract deployed on the Blockchain.",

    "abstract": "Voting is a very important issue which can be beneficial in term of choosing the right leader in an election. A good leader can bring prosperity to a country and also can lead the country in the right direction every time. However, elections are surrounds with ballot forgery, coercion and multiple voting issues. Moreover, while giving votes, a person has to wait in a long queue and it is a very time consuming process. Blockchain is a distributed database in which data are shared with the participant of the node and each participant holds the same copy of the data. Blockchain has properties like distributed, pseudonymous, data integrity etc. In the paper, a fully decentralized evoting system based on blockchain technology is proposed. This protocol utilizes smart contract into the evoting system to deal with security issues, accuracy and voters privacy during the vote. The protocol results in a transparent, non editable and independently verifiable procedure that discards all the intended fraudulent activities occurring during the election process by removing the least participation of the third party and enabling voters right during the election. Both transparency and coercion are obtained at the same time.",

Today, cloud storage services offer clients an infrastructure that allows them a convenient source to store, replicate, and secure data online. However, with these new capabilities also come limitations, such as lack of transparency, limited decentralization, and challenges with privacy and security. And, as the need for more agile, private and secure data solutions continues to grow exponentially, rethinking the current structure of cloud storage is mission-critical for enterprises. By leveraging and building upon blockchain's unique attributes, including immutability, security to the data element level, distributed (no single point of failure), we have developed a solution prototype that allows data to be reliably stored while simultaneously being secured, with tamper-evident auditability, via blockchain. The result, Audita, is a flexible solution that assures data protection and solves challenges such as scalability and privacy. Audita works via an augmented blockchain network of participants that include storage-nodes and block-creators. In addition, it provides an automatic and fair challenge system to assure that data is distributed and reliably and provably stored. While the prototype is built on Quorum, the solution framework can be used with any blockchain platform. The benefit is a system that is built to grow along with the data needs of enterprises, while continuing to build the network via incentives and solving for issues such as auditing and outsourcing.",

    "abstract": "The blockchain data structure maintained via the longest-chain rule---popularized by Bitcoin---is a powerful algorithmic tool for consensus algorithms. Such algorithms achieve consistency for blocks in the chain as a function of their depth from the end of the chain. While the analysis of Bitcoin guarantees consistency with error $2^{-k}$ for blocks of depth $O(k)$, the state-of-the-art of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains suffers from a quadratic dependence on $k$: these protocols, exemplified by Ouroboros (Crypto 2017), Ouroboros Praos (Eurocrypt 2018) and Sleepy Consensus (Asiacrypt 2017), can only establish that depth $\\Theta(k^2)$ is sufficient. Whether this quadratic gap is an intrinsic limitation of PoS---due to issues such as the nothing-at-stake problem---has been an urgent open question, as deployed PoS blockchains further rely on consistency for protocol correctness. We give an axiomatic theory of blockchain dynamics that permits rigorous reasoning about the longest-chain rule and achieve, in broad generality, $\\Theta(k)$ dependence on depth in order to achieve consistency error $2^{-k}$. In particular, for the first time, we show that PoS protocols can match proof-of-work protocols for linear consistency. We analyze the associated stochastic process, give a recursive relation for the critical functionals of this process, and derive tail bounds in both i.i.d. and martingale settings via associated generating functions.",

    "abstract": "Today's permissioned blockchain systems come in a stand-alone fashion and require the users to integrate yet another full-fledged transaction processing system into their already complex data management landscape. This seems odd as blockchains and traditional DBMSs share large parts of their processing stack. Thus, rather than replacing the established data systems altogether, we advocate to simply 'chainify' them with a blockchain layer on top. Unfortunately, this task is far more challenging than it sounds: As we want to build upon heterogeneous transaction processing systems, which potentially behave differently, we cannot rely on every organization to execute every transaction deterministically in the same way. Further, as these systems are already filled with data and being used by top-level applications, we also cannot rely on every organization being resilient against tampering with its local data. Therefore, in this work, we will drop these assumptions and introduce a powerful processing model that avoids them in the first place: The so-called Whatever-LedgerConsensus (WLC) model allows us to create a highly flexible permissioned blockchain layer coined ChainifyDB that (a) is centered around bullet-proof database technology, (b) makes even stronger guarantees than existing permissioned systems, (c) provides a sophisticated recovery mechanism, (d) has an up to 6x higher throughput than the permissioned blockchain system Fabric, and (e) can easily be integrated into an existing heterogeneous database landscape.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate how the governance features of a managed currency (e.g., a fiat currency) can be built into a cryptocurrency in order to leverage potential benefits found in the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts. The resulting managed cryptocurrency can increase transparency and integrity, while potentially enabling the emergence of novel monetary instruments. It has similarities to cash in that it enables the general public to immediately transfer funds to a recipient without intermediary systems being involved. However, our system is account-based, unlike circulating bank notes that are self-contained. Our design would allow one to satisfy know your customer laws and be subject to law enforcement actions following legal due process (e.g., account freezing and fund seizure), while mitigating counterparty risk with checks and balances. Funds can thus be transferred only between approved and authenticated users. Our system has on-chain governance capabilities using smart contracts deployed on a dedicated, permissioned blockchain that has different sets of control mechanisms for who can read data, write data, and publish blocks. To enable the governance features, only authorized identity proofed entities can submit transactions. To enable privacy, only the block publishers can read the blockchain; the publishers maintain dedicated nodes that provide access controlled partial visibility of the blockchain data. Being permissioned, we can use a simple consensus protocol with no transaction fees. A separate security layer prevents denial of service and a balance of power mechanism prevents any small group of entities from having undue control. While permissioned, we ensure that no one entity controls the blockchain data or block publishing capability through a voting system with publicly visible election outcomes.",

    "abstract": "A decade long thrive of cryptocurrency has shown its potential as a source of alternative-finance and the security and the robustness of the underpinning blockchain technology. However, most cryptocurrencies fail to show inimitability and their meanings in the real world. As a result, they usually start off as favourites but quickly become the outcasts of the digital asset market. The blockchain society attempts to anchor the value of cryptocurrency with real values by employing smart contracts and link it with computation resources and the digital-productivity that have value and demands in the real world. But their attempts have some undesirable effects due to a limited number of practical applications. This limitation is caused by the dilemma between high performance and decentralisation (universal joinability). The emerging of blockchain sharding models, however, has offered a possible solution to address this dilemma. In this paper, we explore a financial model for blockchain sharding that will build an active link between the value of cryptocurrency and computation resources as well as the market and labour behaviours. Our model can adjust the price of resources and the compensation for maintaining a system based on those behaviours. We anchor the value of cryptocurrency by the amount of computation resources participated in and give the cryptocurrency a meaning as the exchange between computation resources globally. Finally, we present a working example which, through financial regularities, regulates the behaviour of anonymous participants, also incents/discourages participation dynamically.",

We study the case where permissioned blockchain is applied to the field of horizontal strategic alliances to ensure that any participant of the alliance who does not follow the regulation will be detected and punished for his behavior afterward. We propose a general hierarchical model of permissioned blockchain which includes three tiers: providers, collectors, and governors. To utilize the overlap of collectors in gathering transactions from providers, we introduce the reputation as a measure of the reliability of the collectors. With the help of reputation system, governors will not need to check all transactions uploaded by collectors. As a result, our protocol will have a significant improvement in efficiency. Meanwhile, let us denote $T$ to be the number of total transactions. Then the number of mistakes that governors suffer is only asymptotically $O(\\sqrt{T})$ when guided by our reputation mechanism, as long as there exists a collector who behaves well. This result implies that our protocol remains high performance. The reputation mechanism also provides incentives for collectors to work honestly. To our knowledge, Our work is the first one to give an analytical result on reputation mechanism in permissioned blockchains. Furthermore, we demonstrate two typical cases where our model can be well applied to.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin was the first successful decentralized cryptocurrency and remains the most popular of its kind to this day. Despite the benefits of its blockchain, Bitcoin still faces serious scalability issues, most importantly its ever-increasing blockchain size. While alternative designs introduced schemes to periodically create snapshots and thereafter prune older blocks, already-deployed systems such as Bitcoin are often considered incapable of adopting corresponding approaches. In this work, we revise this popular belief and present CoinPrune, a snapshot-based pruning scheme that is fully compatible with Bitcoin. CoinPrune can be deployed through an opt-in velvet fork, i.e., without impeding the established Bitcoin network. By requiring miners to publicly announce and jointly reaffirm recent snapshots on the blockchain, CoinPrune establishes trust into the snapshots' correctness even in the presence of powerful adversaries. Our evaluation shows that CoinPrune reduces the storage requirements of Bitcoin already by two orders of magnitude today, with further relative savings as the blockchain grows. In our experiments, nodes only have to fetch and process 5 GiB instead of 230 GiB of data when joining the network, reducing the synchronization time on powerful devices from currently 5 h to 46 min, with even more savings for less powerful devices.",

    "abstract": "IoT devices have been adopted widely in the last decade which enabled collection of various data from different environments. The collected data is crucial in certain applications where IoT devices generate data for critical infrastructure or systems whose failure may result in catastrophic results. Specifically, for such critical applications, data storage poses challenges since the data may be compromised during the storage and the integrity might be violated without being noticed. In such cases, integrity and data provenance are required in order to be able to detect the source of any incident and prove it in legal cases if there is a dispute with the involved parties. To address these issues, blockchain provides excellent opportunities since it can protect the integrity of the data thanks to its distributed structure. However, it comes with certain costs as storing huge amount of data in a public blockchain will come with significant transaction fees. In this paper, we propose a highly cost effective and reliable digital forensics framework by exploiting multiple inexpensive blockchain networks as a temporary storage before the data is committed to Ethereum. To reduce Ethereum costs,we utilize Merkle trees which hierarchically stores hashes of the collected event data from IoT devices. We evaluated the approach on popular blockchains such as EOS, Stellar, and Ethereum by presenting a cost and security analysis. The results indicate that we can achieve significant cost savings without compromising the integrity of the data.",

E-government is one of the most complex systems which needs to be distributed, secured and privacy-preserved, and the failure of these can be very costly both economically and socially. Most of the existing e-government systems such as websites and electronic identity management systems (eIDs) are centralized at duplicated servers and databases. A centralized management and validation system may suffer from a single point of failure and make the system a target to cyber attacks such as malware, denial of service attacks (DoS), and distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS). The blockchain technology enables the implementation of highly secure and privacy-preserving decentralized systems where transactions are not under the control of any third party organizations. Using the blockchain technology, exiting data and new data are stored in a sealed compartment of blocks (i.e., ledger) distributed across the network in a verifiable and immutable way. Information security and privacy are enhanced by the blockchain technology in which data are encrypted and distributed across the entire network. This paper proposes a framework of a decentralized e-government peer-to-peer (p2p) system using the blockchain technology, which can ensure both information security and privacy while simultaneously increasing the trust of the public sectors. In addition, a prototype of the proposed system is presented, with the support of a theoretical and qualitative analysis of the security and privacy implications of such system.",

With the integration of blockchain in such networks, information of all granularity levels, from complete blocks to individual transactions, would be accessible to vehicles at any time. Specifically, the blockchain technology is expected to improve the security, immutability, and decentralization of cellular V2X communication through smart contract and distributed ledgers. Although blockchain-based cellular V2X networks hold promise, many challenges need to be addressed to enable the future interoperability and accessibility of such large-scale platforms. One such challenge is the offloading of mining tasks in cellular V2X networks. While transportation authorities may try to balance the network mining load, the vehicles may select the nearest mining clusters to offload a task. This may cause congestion and disproportionate use of vehicular network resources. To address this issue, we propose a game-theoretic approach for balancing the load at mining clusters while maintaining fairness among offloading vehicles. Keeping in mind the low-latency requirements of vehicles, we consider a finite channel blocklength transmission which is more practical compared to the use of infinite blocklength codes. The simulation results obtained with our proposed offloading framework show improved performance over the conventional nearest mining cluster selection technique.",

    "abstract": "In modern healthcare systems, being able to share electronic health records is crucial for providing quality care and for enabling a larger spectrum of health services. Health data sharing is dependent on obtaining individual consent which, in turn, is hindered by a lack of resources. To this extend, blockchain-based platforms facilitate data sharing by inherently creating a trusted distributed network of users. These users are enabled to share their data without depending on the time and resources of specific players (such as the health services). In blockchain-based platforms, data governance mechanisms become very important due to the need to specify and monitor data sharing and data use conditions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based data sharing consent model for access control over individual health data. We use smart contracts to dynamically represent the individual consent over health data and to enable data requesters to search and access them. The dynamic consent model extends upon two ontologies: the Data Use Ontology (DUO) which models the individual consent of users and the Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix (ADA-M) which describes queries from data requesters. We deploy the model on Ethereum blockchain and evaluate different data sharing scenarios. The contribution of this paper is to create an individual consent model for health data sharing platforms. Such a model guarantees that individual consent is respected and that there is accountability for all the participants in the data sharing platform. The evaluation of our solution indicates that such a data sharing model provides a flexible approach to decide how the data is used by data requesters. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed model is efficient and adapts to personalized access control policies in data sharing.",

    "abstract": "In Bitcoin and Ethereum, nodes require large storage capacity to maintain all the blockchain data, such as transactions, UTXOs, and account states. As of May 2020, the storage size of the Bitcoin blockchain has expanded to 270 GB, and it will continue to increase. This storage requirement is a major hurdle to becoming a block proposer or validator. Although many studies have attempted to reduce the storage size, in the proposed methods, a node cannot keep all blocks or cannot generate a block. We propose an architecture called Trail that allows nodes to hold all blocks in a small storage and to generate and validate blocks and transactions. Trail does not depend on a consensus algorithm or fork choice rule. In this architecture, a client who issues transactions has the data to prove its own balances and can generate a transaction containing the proof of balances. The nodes in Trail do not store transactions, UTXOs and account balances: they keep only blocks. The blocksize is approximately 8 KB, which is 100 times smaller than that of Bitcoin. Further, the block size is constant regardless of the number of accounts and the number of transactions. Compared to traditional blockchains, clients who issue transactions must store additional data. However, we show that proper data archiving can keep the account device storage size small. Trail allows more users to be block proposers and validators and improves the decentralization of the blockchain.",

    "abstract": "The blockchain space is changing constantly. New chains are being implemented frequently with different use cases in mind. As more and more types of crypto assets are getting real world value there is an increasing need for blockchain interoperability. Exchange services today are still dominated by central parties which require custody of funds. This trust imposes costs and security risks as frequent breaches testify. Atomic cross-chain swaps (ACCS) allow mutual distrusting parties to securely exchange crypto assets in a peer-to-peer manner while preserving self-custody. Fundamental ACCS protocols leveraged the scripting capabilities of blockchains to conditionalize the transfer of funds between trading parties. Recent work showed that such protocols can be realized in a scriptless setting. This has many benefits to blockchains throughput, efficiency of swap protocols and also to fungibility and privacy. The proposed protocols are limited to assets transferable by either Schnorr signatures or ECDSA that are assuming the same elliptic curve parameters. In this work we present JugglingSwap, a scriptless atomic cross-chain swap protocol with a higher degree of interoperability. We weaken the assumptions about blockchains that can be included in the ACCS protocol, and only require that (1) a threshold variant exists to the underlying digital signature scheme and (2) it is based on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). The fair exchange is achieved by a gradual release of secrets. To achieve this we use a new building block we call Juggling: a public key verifiable encryption scheme to transfer segments of secret shares between parties, which can also be of separate interest. Juggling is then tailored to a specific private key management system design with threshold signatures security.",

However, the mining process requires high computational power, which prevents IoT devices from directly participating in blockchain construction. For this reason, edge computing service is introduced to help build the IoT blockchain, where IoT devices could purchase computational resources from the edge servers. In this paper, we consider the case that IoT devices also have other tasks that need the help of edge servers, such as data analysis and data storage. The profits they can get from these tasks is closely related to the amounts of resources they purchased from the edge servers. In this scenario, IoT devices will allocate their limited budgets to purchase different resources from different edge servers, such that their profits can be maximized. Moreover, edge servers will set \"best\" prices such that they can get the biggest benefits. Accordingly, there raise a pricing and budget allocation problem between edge servers and IoT devices. We model the interaction between edge servers and IoT devices as a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game, whose objective is to reach the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE). We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SE point, and design efficient algorithms to reach the SE point. In the end, we verify our model and algorithms by performing extensive simulations, and the results show the correctness and effectiveness of our designs.",

This article introduces a blockchain-enabled resource sharing and service composition solution through volunteer computing. Device resource, computing, and intelligence capabilities are advertised in the environment to be made discoverable and available for sharing with the aid of blockchain technology. Incentives in the form of on-demand service availability are given to resource and service providers to ensure fair and balanced cooperative resource usage. Blockchains are formed whenever a service request is initiated with the aid of fog and mobile edge computing (MEC) devices to ensure secure communication and service delivery for the participants. Using both volunteer computing techniques and tactile internet architectures, we devise a fast and reliable service provisioning framework that relies on a reinforcement learning technique. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve high reward distribution, increased number of blockchain formations, reduced delays, and balanced resource usage among participants, under the premise of high IoT device availability.",

This work presents the Ethereum Network Analyzer (Ethna), a tool that probes and analyzes the P2P network of the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin that adopts an unstructured P2P network, Ethereum relies on the Kademlia DHT to manage its P2P network. Therefore, the existing analyzing methods proposed for Bitcoin-like P2P networks are not applicable to Ethereum. In Ethna, we implement a novel method that can accurately measures the degrees of Ethereum nodes; moreover, we design an algorithm that derives the latency metrics of the message dissemination in the Ethereum network. We run Ethna on the Ethereum Mainnet and conduct extensive experiments to analyze the topological features of its P2P network. Our analysis shows that the Ethereum P2P network conforms to the small-world property, and the degrees of nodes follow a power-law distribution that characterizes scale-free networks.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a blockchain-based approach for securing spectrum sharing in multi-beam satellite systems. Satellite spectrum is a scarce resource that requires highly efficient management schemes for optimized sharing by network users. However, spectrum sharing is vulnerable to attacks by malicious protocol participants. In order to ensure efficient spectrum management in the face of dishonest satellite users or cyber attackers, it is important for spectrum sharing mechanism to provide transparency and traceability of the trading process so as to enable the system to detect, and hence eliminate, unauthorized access by malicious users. We address these requirements by proposing the use of blockchain which, apart from its ability to provide transparency and traceability, ensures an immutable means for keeping track of user trading reputation. Besides, in order to address the practical constraints of heterogeneous user nodes, we also propose the use of edge computing to support users with limited computing power. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based spectrum trading framework and, based on which, a multibeam satellite spectrum sharing algorithm for interference pricing and heterogeneous spectrum demands is devised to improve the efficiency of satellite spectrum. By leveraging on the system characteristics of blockchain, a dynamic spectrum sharing mechanism with traceability, openness and transparency for whole trading process is presented. Numerical results are also provided to evaluate the system benefits and spectrum pricing of the proposed mechanism.",

In particular, we improve the compact-block relaying protocol to enable the propagation of blocks containing a massive number of transactions without inducing extra propagation latencies. Our improvements consist of (i) replacing the existing store-and-forward compact-block relaying scheme with a cut-through compact-block relaying scheme; (ii) exploiting rateless erasure codes for P2P networks to increase block-propagation efficiency. Since our protocols only need to rework the current Bitcoin's networking protocol and does not modify the data structures and crypto-functional components, they can be seamlessly incorporated into the existing Bitcoin blockchain. To validate our designs, we perform analysis on our protocols and implement a Bitcoin network simulator on NS3 to run different block propagation protocols. The analysis and experimental results confirm that our new block propagation protocols could increase the TPS of the Bitcoin blockchain by 100x without compromising security and consensus-building.",

    "abstract": "Permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin have excelled at financial services. Yet, adversaries extract monetary value from the mesh of decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts. Some have characterized the Ethereum peer-to-peer network as a dark forest, wherein broadcast transactions represent prey, which are devoured by generalized trading bots. While transaction (re)ordering and front-running are known to cause losses to users, we quantify how much value was sourced from blockchain extractable value (BEV). We systematize a transaction ordering taxonomy to quantify the USD extracted from sandwich attacks, liquidations, and decentralized exchange arbitrage. We estimate that over 2 years, those trading activities yielded 28.80M USD in profit, divided among 5,084 unique addresses. While arbitrage and liquidations might appear benign, traders can front-run others, causing financial losses to competitors. To provide an example of a generalized trading bot, we show a simple yet effective automated transaction replay algorithm capable of replacing unconfirmed transactions without understanding the victim transactions' underlying logic. We estimate that our transaction replay algorithm could have yielded a profit of 51,688.33 ETH (17.60M USD) over 2 years on past blockchain data. We also find that miners do not broadcast 1.64% of their mined transactions and instead choose to mine them privately. Privately mined transactions cannot be front-run by other traders or miners. We show that the largest Ethereum mining pool performs arbitrage and seemingly tries to cloak its private transaction mining activities. We therefore provide evidence that miners already extract Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which could destabilize the blockchain consensus security, as related work has shown.",

    "abstract": "Tendermint-core blockchains (e.g. Cosmos) are considered today one of the most viable alternatives for the highly energy consuming proof-of-work blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their particularity is that they aim at offering strong consistency (no forks) in an open system combining two ingredients (i) a set of validators that generate blocks via a variant of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus protocol and (ii) a selection strategy that dynamically selects nodes to be validators for the next block via a proof-of-stake mechanism. However,the exact assumptions on the system model under which Tendermint underlying algorithms are correct and the exact properties Tendermint verifies have never been formally analyzed. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, while formalizing Tendermint algorithms we precisely characterize the system model and the exact problem solved by Tendermint. We prove that in eventual synchronous systems a modified version of Tendermint solves (i) under additional assumptions, a variant of one-shot consensus for the validation of one single block and (ii) a variant of the repeated consensus problem for multiple blocks. These results hold even if the set of validators is hit by Byzantine failures, provided that for each one-shot consensus instance less than one third of the validators is Byzantine. Our second contribution relates to the fairness of the rewarding mechanism. It is common knowledge that in permisionless blockchain systems the main threat is the tragedy of commons that may yield the system to collapse if the rewarding mechanism is not adequate. Ad minimum the rewarding mechanism must be fair, i.e.distributing the rewards in proportion to the merit of participants. We prove, for the first time in blockchain systems, that in repeated-consensus based blockchains there exists an (eventual) fair rewarding mechanism if and only if the system is (eventual) synchronous. We also show that the original Tendermint rewarding is not fair, however, a modification of the original protocol makes it eventually fair.",

    "abstract": "As an emerging decentralized secure data management platform, blockchain has gained much popularity recently. To maintain a canonical state of blockchain data record, proof-of-work based consensus protocols provide the nodes, referred to as miners, in the network with incentives for confirming new block of transactions through a process of \"block mining\" by solving a cryptographic puzzle. Under the circumstance of limited local computing resources, e.g., mobile devices, it is natural for rational miners, i.e., consensus nodes, to offload computational tasks for proof of work to the cloud/fog computing servers. Therefore, we focus on the trading between the cloud/fog computing service provider and miners, and propose an auction-based market model for efficient computing resource allocation. In particular, we consider a proof-of-work based blockchain network. Due to the competition among miners in the blockchain network, the allocative externalities are particularly taken into account when designing the auction mechanisms. Specifically, we consider two bidding schemes: the constant-demand scheme where each miner bids for a fixed quantity of resources, and the multi-demand scheme where the miners can submit their preferable demands and bids. For the constant-demand bidding scheme, we propose an auction mechanism that achieves optimal social welfare. In the multi-demand bidding scheme, the social welfare maximization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we design an approximate algorithm which guarantees the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed auction mechanisms with the two bidding schemes can efficiently maximize the social welfare of the blockchain network and provide effective strategies for the cloud/fog computing service provider.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin is an immutable permissionless blockchain system that has been extensively used as a public bulletin board by many different applications that heavily relies on its immutability. However, Bitcoin's immutability is not without its fair share of demerits. Interpol exposed the existence of harmful and potentially illegal documents, images and links in the Bitcoin blockchain, and since then there have been several qualitative and quantitative analysis on the types of data currently residing in the Bitcoin blockchain. Although there is a lot of attention on blockchains, surprisingly the previous solutions proposed for data redaction in the permissionless setting are far from feasible, and require additional trust assumptions. Hence, the problem of harmful data still poses a huge challenge for law enforcement agencies like Interpol (Tziakouris, IEEE S&P'18). We propose the first efficient redactable blockchain for the permissionless setting that is easily integrable into Bitcoin, and that does not rely on heavy cryptographic tools or trust assumptions. Our protocol uses a consensus-based voting and is parameterised by a policy that dictates the requirements and constraints for the redactions; if a redaction gathers enough votes the operation is performed on the chain. As an extra feature, our protocol offers public verifiability and accountability for the redacted chain. Moreover, we provide formal security definitions and proofs showing that our protocol is secure against redactions that were not agreed by consensus. Additionally, we show the viability of our approach with a proof-of-concept implementation that shows only a tiny overhead in the chain validation of our protocol when compared to an immutable one.",

    "abstract": "The old mantra of decentralizing the Internet is coming again with fanfare, this time around the blockchain technology hype. We have already seen a technology supposed to change the nature of the Internet: peer-to-peer. The reality is that peer-to-peer naming systems failed, peer-to-peer social networks failed, and yes, peer-to-peer storage failed as well. In this paper, we will review the research on distributed systems in the last few years to identify the limits of open peer-to-peer networks. We will address issues like system complexity, security and frailty, instability and performance. We will show how many of the aforementioned problems also apply to the recent breed of permissionless blockchain networks. The applicability of such systems to mature industrial applications is undermined by the same properties that make them so interesting for a libertarian audience: namely, their openness, their pseudo-anonymity and their unregulated cryptocurrencies. As such, we argue that permissionless blockchain networks are unsuitable to be the substrate for a decentralized Internet. Yet, there is still hope for more decentralization, albeit in a form somewhat limited with respect to the libertarian view of decentralized Internet: in cooperation rather than in competition with the superpowerful datacenters that dominate the world today. This is derived from the recent surge in interest in byzantine fault tolerance and permissioned blockchains, which opens the door to a world where use of trusted third parties is not the only way to arbitrate an ensemble of entities. The ability of establish trust through permissioned blockchains enables to move the control from the datacenters to the edge, truly realizing the promises of edge-centric computing.",

    "abstract": "Ride-sharing is a service that enables drivers to share their trips with other riders, contributing to appealing benefits of shared travel costs. However, the majority of existing platforms rely on a central third party, which make them subject to a single point of failure and privacy disclosure issues. Moreover, they are vulnerable to DDoS and Sybil attacks due to malicious users involvement. Besides, high fees should be paid to the service provider. In this paper, we propose a decentralized ride-sharing service based on public Blockchain, named B-Ride. Both riders and drivers can find rides match while preserving their trip data, including pick-up/drop-off location, and departure/arrival date. However, under the anonymity of the public blockchain, a malicious user may submit multiple ride requests or offers, while not committing to any of them, to discover better offer or to make the system unreliable. B-Ride solves this problem by introducing a time-locked deposit protocol for a ride-sharing by leveraging smart contract and zero-knowledge set membership proof. In a nutshell, both a driver and a rider have to show their commitment by sending a deposit to the blockchain. Later, a driver has to prove to the blockchain on the agreed departure time that he has arrived at the pick-up location. To preserve rider/driver location privacy by hiding the exact pick-up location, the proof is done using zero-knowledge set membership protocol. Moreover, to ensure a fair payment, a pay-as-you-drive methodology is introduced based on the elapsed distance of the driver and the rider. Also, we introduce a reputation-based trust model to rate drivers based on their past trips to allow riders to select them based on their history on the system. Finally, we implement B-Ride in a test net of Ethereum. The experiment results show the applicability of our protocol atop the existing real-world blockchain.",

As such, we identify the significant security challenges of smart grid scenarios that can be addressed by blockchain. Then, we present a number of blockchain-based recent research works presented in different literatures addressing security issues in the area of smart grid. We also summarize several related practical projects, trials, and products that have been emerged recently.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a new framework called blockchain-based Radio Frequency (RF)-powered backscatter cognitive radio network. In the framework, IoT devices as secondary transmitters transmit their sensing data to a secondary gateway by using the RF-powered backscatter cognitive radio technology. The data collected at the gateway is then sent to a blockchain network for further verification, storage and processing. As such, the framework enables the IoT system to simultaneously optimize the spectrum usage and maximize the energy efficiency. Moreover, the framework ensures that the data collected from the IoT devices is verified, stored and processed in a decentralized but in a trusted manner. To achieve the goal, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem for the gateway under the dynamics of the primary channel, the uncertainty of the IoT devices, and the unpredictability of the blockchain environment. In the problem, the gateway jointly decides (i) the time scheduling, i.e., the energy harvesting time, backscatter time, and transmission time, among the IoT devices, (ii) the blockchain network, and (iii) the transaction fee rate to maximize the network throughput while minimizing the cost. To solve the stochastic optimization problem, we then propose to employ, evaluate, and assess the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (D3QN) to derive the optimal policy for the gateway. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed solution outperforms the conventional baseline approaches such as the conventional Q-Learning algorithm and non-learning algorithms in terms of network throughput and convergence speed. Furthermore, the proposed solution guarantees that the data is stored in the blockchain network at a reasonable cost.",

    ],
    "abstract": "To implement a blockchain, we need a blockchain protocol for all the nodes to follow. To design a blockchain protocol, we need a block publisher selection mechanism and a chain selection rule. In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based blockchain protocols, block publisher selection mechanism selects the node to publish the next block based on the relative stake held by the node. However, PoS protocols, such as Ouroboros v1, may face vulnerability to fully adaptive corruptions. In this paper, we propose a novel PoS-based blockchain protocol, QuickSync, to achieve security against fully adaptive corruptions while improving on performance. We propose a metric called block power, a value defined for each block, derived from the output of the verifiable random function based on the digital signature of the block publisher. With this metric, we compute chain power, the sum of block powers of all the blocks comprising the chain, for all the valid chains. These metrics are a function of the block publisher's stake to enable the PoS aspect of the protocol. The chain selection rule selects the chain with the highest chain power as the one to extend. This chain selection rule hence determines the selected block publisher of the previous block. When we use metrics to define the chain selection rule, it may lead to vulnerabilities against Sybil attacks. QuickSync uses a Sybil attack resistant function implemented using histogram matching. We prove that QuickSync satisfies common prefix, chain growth, and chain quality properties and hence it is secure. We also show that it is resilient to different types of adversarial attack strategies. Our analysis demonstrates that QuickSync performs better than Bitcoin by an order of magnitude on both transactions per second and time to finality, and better than Ouroboros v1 by a factor of three on time to finality.",

    "abstract": "The digital currency Bitcoin has had remarkable growth since it was first proposed in 2008. Its distributed nature allows currency transactions without a central authority by using cryptographic methods and a data structure called the blockchain. In this paper we use the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics to introduce Quantum Bitcoin, a Bitcoin-like currency that runs on a quantum computer. We show that our construction of quantum shards and two blockchains allows untrusted peers to mint quantum money without risking the integrity of the currency. The Quantum Bitcoin protocol has several advantages over classical Bitcoin, including immediate local verification of transactions. This is a major improvement since we no longer need the computationally intensive and time-consuming method Bitcoin uses to record all transactions in the blockchain. Instead, Quantum Bitcoin only records newly minted currency which drastically reduces the footprint and increases efficiency. We present formal security proofs for counterfeiting resistance and show that a quantum bitcoin can be re-used a large number of times before wearing out - just like ordinary coins and banknotes. Quantum Bitcoin is the first distributed quantum money system and we show that the lack of a paper trail implies full anonymity for the users. In addition, there are no transaction fees and the system can scale to any transaction volume.",

However, several of the heterogeneous characteristics that make them ideal for certain future applications --- robot autonomy, decentralized control, collective emergent behavior, etc. --- hinder the evolution of the technology from academic institutions to real-world problems. Blockchain, an emerging technology originated in the Bitcoin field, demonstrates that by combining peer-to-peer networks with cryptographic algorithms a group of agents can reach an agreement on a particular state of affairs and record that agreement without the need for a controlling authority. The combination of blockchain with other distributed systems, such as robotic swarm systems, can provide the necessary capabilities to make robotic swarm operations more secure, autonomous, flexible and even profitable. This work explains how blockchain technology can provide innovative solutions to four emergent issues in the swarm robotics research field. New security, decision making, behavior differentiation and business models for swarm robotic systems are described by providing case scenarios and examples. Finally, limitations and possible future problems that arise from the combination of these two technologies are described.",

The platform's design exhibits principles required by enterprise grade business applications like supply-chains, financial transactions, asset management, food safety, and many more. For that end HLF introduces several innovations, two of which are smart contracts in general purpose languages (\\emph{chaincode} in HLF), and flexible endorsement policies, which govern whether a transaction is considered valid. Typical blockchain applications are comprised of two tiers: the first tier focuses on the modelling of the data schema and embedding of business rules into the blockchain by means of smart contracts (\\emph{chaincode}) and endorsment policies; and the second tier uses the SDK (Software Development Kit) provided by HLF to implement client side application logic. However there is a gap between the two tiers that hinders the rapid adoption of changes in the chaincode and endorsement policies within the client SDK. Currently, the chaincode location and endorsement policies are statically configured into the client SDK. This limits the reliability and availability of the client in the event of changes in the platform, and makes the platform more difficult to use. In this work we address and bridge the gap by describing the design and implementation of \\emph{Service Discovery}. \\emph{Service Discovery} provides APIs which allow dynamic discovery of the configuration required for the client SDK to interact with the platform, alleviating the client from the burden of maintaining it. This enables the client to rapidly adapt to changes in the platform, thus significantly improving the reliability of the application layer. It also makes the HLF platform more consumable, simplifying the job of creating blockchain applications.",

    "abstract": "The DFINITY blockchain computer provides a secure, performant and flexible consensus mechanism. At its core, DFINITY contains a decentralized randomness beacon which acts as a verifiable random function (VRF) that produces a stream of outputs over time. The novel technique behind the beacon relies on the existence of a unique-deterministic, non-interactive, DKG-friendly threshold signatures scheme. The only known examples of such a scheme are pairing-based and derived from BLS. The DFINITY blockchain is layered on top of the DFINITY beacon and uses the beacon as its source of randomness for leader selection and leader ranking. A \"weight\" is attributed to a chain based on the ranks of the leaders who propose the blocks in the chain, and that weight is used to select between competing chains. The DFINITY blockchain is layered on top of the DFINITY beacon and uses the beacon as its source of randomness for leader selection and leader ranking blockchain is further hardened by a notarization process which dramatically improves the time to finality and eliminates the nothing-at-stake and selfish mining attacks. DFINITY consensus algorithm is made to scale through continuous quorum selections driven by the random beacon. In practice, DFINITY achieves block times of a few seconds and transaction finality after only two confirmations. The system gracefully handles temporary losses of network synchrony including network splits, while it is provably secure under synchrony.",

Hyperledger Fabric is one such permissioned blockchain platform and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation. The Fabric comprises various components such as smart-contracts, endorsers, committers, validators, and orderers. As the performance of blockchain platform is a major concern for enterprise applications, in this work, we perform a comprehensive empirical study to characterize the performance of Hyperledger Fabric and identify potential performance bottlenecks to gain a better understanding of the system. We follow a two-phased approach. In the first phase, our goal is to understand the impact of various configuration parameters such as block size, endorsement policy, channels, resource allocation, state database choice on the transaction throughput & latency to provide various guidelines on configuring these parameters. In addition, we also aim to identify performance bottlenecks and hotspots. We observed that (1) endorsement policy verification, (2) sequential policy validation of transactions in a block, and (3) state validation and commit (with CouchDB) were the three major bottlenecks. In the second phase, we focus on optimizing Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 based on our observations. We introduced and studied various simple optimizations such as aggressive caching for endorsement policy verification in the cryptography component (3x improvement in the performance) and parallelizing endorsement policy verification (7x improvement). Further, we enhanced and measured the effect of an existing bulk read/write optimization for CouchDB during state validation & commit phase (2.5x improvement). By combining all three optimizations1, we improved the overall throughput by 16x (i.e., from 140 tps to 2250 tps).",

    "abstract": "Abrupt changes in the miner hash rate applied to a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain can adversely affect user experience and security. Because different PoW blockchains often share hashing algorithms, miners face a complex choice in deciding how to allocate their hash power among chains. We present an economic model that leverages Modern Portfolio Theory to predict a miner's allocation over time using price data and inferred risk tolerance. The model matches actual allocations with mean absolute error within 20% for four out of the top five miners active on both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchains. A model of aggregate allocation across those four miners shows excellent agreement in magnitude with the actual aggregate as well a correlation coefficient of 0.649. The accuracy of the aggregate allocation model is also sufficient to explain major historical changes in inter-block time (IBT) for BCH. Because estimates of miner risk are not time-dependent and our model is otherwise price-driven, we are able to use it to anticipate the effect of a major price shock on hash allocation and IBT in the BCH blockchain. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we show that, despite mitigation by the new difficulty adjustment algorithm, a price drop of 50% could increase the IBT by 50% for at least a day, with a peak delay of 100%.",

Our analysis focuses on the value of transactions that can be secured under a conventional double-spend attack, both with and without a concurrent eclipse attack. Our model quantifies the importance of several factors that determine the attack's success, including confirmation depth, attacker mining power, and any confirmation deadline set by the merchant. In general, the security of a transaction against a double-spend attack increases roughly logarithmically with the depth of the block, made easier by the increasing sum of coin turned-over (between individuals) in the blocks, but more difficult by the increasing proof of work required. In recent blockchain data, we observed a median block turnover value of 6 BTC. Based on this value, a merchant requiring a single confirmation is protected against only attackers that can increase the current mining power by 1% or less. However, similar analysis shows that a merchant that requires a much longer 72 confirmations (~12 hours) will eliminate all potential profit for any double-spend attacker adding mining power less than 40% of the current mining power.",

In particular, we study edge computing resource management and pricing to support mobile blockchain applications in which the mining process of miners can be offloaded to an edge computing service provider. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the profit of the edge computing service provider and the individual utilities of the miners. In the first stage, the service provider sets the price of edge computing nodes. In the second stage, the miners decide on the service demand to purchase based on the observed prices. We apply the backward induction to analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium in each stage for both uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. For the uniform pricing where the same price is applied to all miners, the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium are validated by identifying the best response strategies of the miners. For the discriminatory pricing where the different prices are applied to different miners, the Stackelberg equilibrium is proved to exist and be unique by capitalizing on the Variational Inequality theory. Further, the real experimental results are employed to justify our proposed model.",

In this work we propose a blockchain-based system that aims to ensure respect for the rights for all actors involved in a temporary employment, in order to provide employees with the fair and legal remuneration (including taxes) of work performances and a protection in the case employer becomes insolvent. At the same time, our system wants to assist the employer in processing contracts with a fully automated and fast procedure. To resolve these problems we propose the D-ES (Decentralized Employment System). We first model the employment relationship as a state system. Then we describe the enabling technology that makes us able to realize the D-ES. In facts, we propose the implementation of a DLT (Decentralized Ledger Technology) based system, consisting in a blockchain system and of a web-based environment. Thanks the decentralized application platforms that makes us able to develop smart contracts, we define a discrete event control system that works inside the blockchain.

In this paper, we study the dynamics of mining pool selection in a blockchain network, where mining pools may choose arbitrary block mining strategies. We identify the hash rate and the block propagation delay as two major factors determining the outcomes of mining competition, and then model the strategy evolution of the individual miners as an evolutionary game. We provide the theoretical analysis of the evolutionary stability for the pool selection dynamics in a case study of two mining pools. The numerical simulations provide the evidence to support our theoretical discoveries as well as demonstrating the stability in the evolution of miners' strategies in a general case.",

    "abstract": "Many applications require the immutable and consistent sharing of data across organizational boundaries. Because conventional datastores cannot provide this functionality, blockchains have been proposed as one possible solution. Yet public blockchains are energy inefficient, hard to scale and suffer from limited throughput and high latencies, while permissioned blockchains depend on specially designated nodes, potentially leak meta-information, and also suffer from scale and performance bottlenecks. This paper presents CreDB, a datastore that provides blockchain-like guarantees of integrity using trusted execution environments. CreDB employs four novel mechanisms to support a new class of applications. First, it creates a permanent record of every transaction, known as a witness, that clients can then use not only to audit the database but to prove to third parties that desired actions took place. Second, it associates with every object an inseparable and inviolable policy, which not only performs access control but enables the datastore to implement state machines whose behavior is amenable to analysis. Third, timeline inspection allows authorized parties to inspect and reason about the history of changes made to the data. Finally, CreDB provides a protected function evaluation mechanism that allows integrity-protected computation over private data. The paper describes these mechanisms, and the applications they collectively enable, in detail. We have fully implemented a prototype of CreDB on Intel SGX. Evaluation shows that CreDB can serve as a drop-in replacement for other NoSQL stores, such as MongoDB while providing stronger integrity guarantees.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin and other similar digital currencies on blockchains are not ideal means for payment, because their prices tend to go up in the long term (thus people are incentivized to hoard those currencies), and to fluctuate widely in the short term (thus people would want to avoid risks of losing values). The reason why those blockchain currencies based on proof of work are unstable may be found in their designs that the supplies of currencies do not respond to their positive and negative demand shocks, as the authors have formulated in our past work. Continuing from our past work, this paper proposes minimal changes to the design of blockchain currencies so that their market prices are automatically stabilized, absorbing both positive and negative demand shocks of the currencies by autonomously controlling their supplies. Those changes are: 1) limiting re-adjustment of proof-of-work targets, 2) making mining rewards variable according to the observed over-threshold changes of block intervals, and 3) enforcing negative interests to remove old coins in circulation. We have made basic design checks and evaluations of these measures through simple simulations. In addition to stabilization of prices, the proposed measures may have effects of making those currencies preferred means for payment by disincentivizing hoarding, and improving sustainability of the currency systems by making rewards to miners perpetual.",

    "abstract": "Cross-institutional healthcare predictive modeling can accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives, and thus is important for national healthcare delivery priorities. For example, a model that predicts risk of re-admission for a particular set of patients will be more generalizable if developed with data from multiple institutions. While privacy-protecting methods to build predictive models exist, most are based on a centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure (and single-point-of-breach) and accidental or malicious modification of records. In this article, we describe a new framework, ModelChain, to adapt Blockchain technology for privacy-preserving machine learning. Each participating site contributes to model parameter estimation without revealing any patient health information (i.e., only model data, no observation-level data, are exchanged across institutions). We integrate privacy-preserving online machine learning with a private Blockchain network, apply transaction metadata to disseminate partial models, and design a new proof-of-information algorithm to determine the order of the online learning process. We also discuss the benefits and potential issues of applying Blockchain technology to solve the privacy-preserving healthcare predictive modeling task and to increase interoperability between institutions, to support the Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap and national healthcare delivery priorities such as Patient-Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR).",

However, new classes of applications have emerged, e.g., blockchain and collaborative analytics, featuring data versioning, fork semantics, tamper-evidence or any combination thereof. They present new opportunities for storage systems to efficiently support such applications by embedding the above requirements into the storage. In this paper, we present ForkBase, a storage engine specifically designed to provide efficient support for blockchain and forkable applications. By integrating the core application properties into the storage, ForkBase not only delivers high performance but also reduces development effort. Data in ForkBase is multi-versioned, and each version uniquely identifies the data content and its history. Two variants of fork semantics are supported in ForkBase to facilitate any collaboration workflows. A novel index structure is introduced to efficiently identify and eliminate duplicate content across data objects. Consequently, ForkBase is not only efficient in performance, but also in space requirement. We demonstrate the performance of ForkBase using three applications: a blockchain platform, a wiki engine and a collaborative analytics application. We conduct extensive experimental evaluation of these applications against respective state-of-the-art system. The results show that ForkBase achieves superior performance while significantly lowering the development cost.",

While leveraging the large scale IoT based applications like Smart Gird or Smart Cities, IoTs also incur more concerns on privacy and security. Among the top security challenges that IoTs face, access authorization is critical in resource sharing and information protection. One of the weaknesses in today's access control (AC) is the centralized authorization server, which can be the performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. In this paper, BlendCAC, a blockchain enabled decentralized capability based AC is proposed for the security of IoTs. The BlendCAC aims at an effective access control processes to devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems. Based on the blockchain network, a capability delegation mechanism is suggested for access permission propagation. A robust identity based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of smart contract for registering, propagation and revocation of the access authorization. In the proposed BlendCAC scheme, IoT devices are their own master to control their resources instead of being supervised by a centralized authority. Implemented and tested on a Raspberry Pi device and on a local private blockchain network, our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed BlendCAC approach to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine grained AC solution to IoT systems.",

Vehicles can use smart city data for decision-making, such as dynamic routing based on traffic conditions. Moreover, the multitude of embedded sensors in vehicles can collectively produce a rich data set of the urban landscape that can be used to provide a range of services. Key to the success of this vision is a scalable and private architecture for trusted data sharing. This paper proposes a framework called SpeedyChain, that leverages blockchain technology to allow smart vehicles to share their data while maintaining privacy, integrity, resilience and non-repudiation in a decentralized, and tamper-resistant manner. Differently from traditional blockchain usage (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), the proposed framework uses a blockchain design that decouples the data stored in the transactions from the block header, thus allowing for fast addition of data to the blocks. Furthermore, an expiration time for each block to avoid large sized blocks is proposed.

We start off by giving a simple overview of blockchain based SSI, introducing an architecture overview as well as relevant actors in such a system. We further distinguish two major approaches, namely the Identifier Registry Model and its extension the Claim Registry Model. Subsequently we discuss identifiers in such a system, presenting past research in the area and current approaches in SSI in the context of Zooko's Triangle. As the user of an SSI has to be linked with his digital identifier we also discuss authentication solutions. Most central to the concept of an SSI are the verifiable claims that are presented to relying parties. Resources in the field are only losely connected. We will provide a more coherent view of verifiable claims in regards to blockchain based SSI and clarify differences in the used terminology.

Compared to the traditional surveillance systems that is built following a monolithic architecture to carry out lower level operations, such as monitoring and recording, the modern surveillance systems are expected to support more scalable and decentralized solutions for advanced video stream analysis at the large volumes of distributed edge devices. In addition, the centralized architecture of the conventional surveillance systems is vulnerable to single point of failure and privacy breach owning to the lack of protection to the surveillance feed. This position paper introduces a novel secure smart surveillance system based on microservices architecture and blockchain technology. Encapsulating the video analysis algorithms as various independent microservices not only isolates the video feed from different sectors, but also improve the system availability and robustness by decentralizing the operations. The blockchain technology securely synchronizes the video analysis databases among microservices across surveillance domains, and provides tamper proof of data in the trustless network environment. Smart contract enabled access authorization strategy prevents any unauthorized user from accessing the microservices and offers a scalable, decentralized and fine-grained access control solution for smart surveillance systems.",

However, existing solutions suffer from lack of privacy, processing and packet overheads, and reliance on Trusted Third Parties (TTP). To address these challenges, we propose a Secure Private Blockchain-based (SPB) framework. SPB enables the energy producers and consumers to directly negotiate the energy price. To reduce the associated packet overhead, we propose a routing method which routes packets based on the destination Public Key (PK). SPB eliminates the need for TTP by introducing atomic meta-transactions. The two transactions that form a meta-transaction are visible to the blockchain participants only after both of them are generated. Thus, if one of the participants does not commit to its tasks in a pre-defined time, then the energy trade expires and the corresponding transaction is treated as invalid. The smart meter of the consumer confirms receipt of energy by generating an Energy Receipt Confirmation (ERC). To verify that the ERC is generated by a genuine smart meter, SPB supports authentication of anonymous smart meters which in turn enhances the privacy of the meter owner. Qualitative security analysis shows the resilience of SPB against a range of attacks.",

Smart contracts, by operating as processes that are executed on the blockchain, are used to preserve users' privacy and make payments. Furthermore, for the assignment of the crowdsensing tasks to the mobile users, we design a truthful, cost-optimal auction that minimizes the payments from the crowdsensing providers to the mobile users. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed privacy preserving auction outperforms state-of-the-art proposals regarding cost by ten times for high numbers of mobile users and tasks.",

Such a scenario has transformed the world a few decades back, dominated by latency, into a new world based on an efficient real-time interaction paradigm.Recently, cryptocurrency have contributed to this technological revolution, the fulcrum of which are a decentralization model and a certification function offered by the so-called blockchain infrastructure, which make it possible to certify the financial transactions, anonymously. However, it should be observed how this challenging scenario has generated new security problems directly related to the involved new technologies (e.g., e-commerce frauds, mobile bot-net attacks, blockchain DoS attacks, cryptocurrency scams, etc.). In this context, we can acknowledge that the scientific community efforts are usually oriented toward specific solutions, instead to exploit all the available technologies, synergistically, in order to define more efficient security paradigms. This paper aims to indicate a possible approach able to improve the security of people and things by introducing a novel paradigm to security defined Internet of Entities (IoE). It is a mechanism for the localization of people and things, which exploits both the huge number of existing wireless-based devices and the blockchain-based distributed ledger technology, overcoming the limits of traditional localization approaches, but without jeopardizing the user privacy. Its operation is based on two core elements with interchangeable roles, entities and trackers, which can be very common elements such as smart-phones, tablets, and IoT devices, and its implementation requires minimal efforts thanks to the existing infrastructures and devices.",

However, existing IoT platforms and framework rely on dedicated middleware for (semi-) centralized task dispatching, data storage and incentive provision. Consequently, they are usually expensive to deploy, have limited adaptability to diverse requirements, and face a series of data security and privacy issues. In this paper, we employ permissionless blockchains to construct a purely decentralized platform for data storage and trading in a wireless-powered IoT crowdsensing system. In the system, IoT sensors use power wirelessly transferred from RF-energy beacons for data sensing and transmission to an access point. The data is then forwarded to the blockchain for distributed ledger services, i.e., data/transaction verification, recording, and maintenance. Due to coupled interference of wireless transmission and transaction fee incurred from blockchain's distributed ledger services, rational sensors have to decide on their transmission rates to maximize individual utility. Thus, we formulate a noncooperative game model to analyze this competitive situation among the sensors. We provide the analytical condition for the existence of the Nash equilibrium as well as a series of insightful numerical results about the equilibrium strategies in the game.",

Typically, instead of validating block data, they assume that the chain favoured by the blockchain's consensus algorithm only contains valid blocks, and that the majority of block producers are honest. By allowing such clients to receive fraud proofs generated by fully validating nodes that show that a block violates the protocol rules, and combining this with probabilistic sampling techniques to verify that all of the data in a block actually is available to be downloaded, we can eliminate the honest-majority assumption, and instead make much weaker assumptions about a minimum number of honest nodes that rebroadcast data. Fraud and data availability proofs are key to enabling on-chain scaling of blockchains (e.g. via sharding or bigger blocks) while maintaining a strong assurance that on-chain data is available and valid. We present, implement, and evaluate a novel fraud and data availability proof system.",

Using feedback control, sensor management, and communications reliability. For information management, there is a need for identity authentication and access control to ensure the integrity of exchanged data as well as to grant authorized entities access right to data and services.

To achieve secure identity authentication, the BlendCAC leverages the blockchain to create virtual trust zones and a robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices and more powerful computing devices, and is tested on a private Ethereum blockchain network.

In this paper we argue that blockchain algorithms should tolerate both rational (self-interested) users and Byzantine (malicious) ones, rather than assuming all non-Byzantine users are altruistic and follow the protocols blindly. Such algorithms are called BAR-tolerant [1]. To design a BAR-tolerant system, one can follow these three steps: clearly define the utility function for the rational users, prove the algorithm is such that there is no benefit from unilaterally deviating (that is, it's a Byzantine Nash Equilibrium), then prove the algorithm correct assuming the rational actors follow the protocol. We present an example attack by rational users: the gatekeeping attack, where members of a system selfishly decide to prevent newcomers from joining. This attack may affect any stake-based system where the existing members prevent newcomers from making a stake, and essentially form a cartel. We then sketch a BAR-tolerant consensus protocol for blockchain that can defend against this attack. It relies on a strict order to decide who gets to propose a new block (so there's no need to race to solve a crypto puzzle) and it relies on hardware ID tokens to make sure every computer is only represented at most once as a block proposer to mitigate Sybil attacks. It also defends against the gatekeeper attack. The BAR-tolerant approach is naturally also applicable to other blockchain algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have gained extensive attention from both academia and industry. AVs are a complex system composed of many subsystems, making them a typical target for attackers. Therefore, the firmware of the different subsystems needs to be updated to the latest version by the manufacturer to fix bugs and introduce new features, e.g., using security patches. In this paper, we propose a distributed firmware update scheme for the AVs' subsystems, leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology. A consortium blockchain made of different AVs manufacturers is used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of firmware updates. Instead of depending on centralized third parties to distribute the new updates, we enable AVs, namely distributors, to participate in the distribution process and we take advantage of their mobility to guarantee high availability and fast delivery of the updates. To incentivize AVs to distribute the updates, a reward system is established that maintains a credit reputation for each distributor account in the blockchain. A zero-knowledge proof protocol is used to exchange the update in return for a proof of distribution in a trust-less environment. Moreover, we use attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme to ensure that only authorized AVs will be able to download and use a new update. Our analysis indicates that the additional cryptography primitives and exchanged transactions do not affect the operation of the AVs network. Also, our security analysis demonstrates that our scheme is efficient and secure against different attacks.",

Therefore, it is high time to think about a more secure and flexible question sharing system which can prevent QPL issue in the future education system. Blockchain enables a way of creating and storing transactions, contracts or anything that requires protection against tampering, accessing etc. This paper presents a new scheme for smart education, by utilizing the concept of blockchain, for question sharing. A two-phase encryption technique for encrypting question paper (QSP) is proposed. In the first phase, QSPs are encrypted using timestamp and in the second phase, previous encrypted QSPs are encrypted again using a timestamp, salt hash and hashes from previous QSPs. These encrypted QSPs are stored in the blockchain along with a smart contract which helps the user to unlock the selected QSP. An algorithm is also proposed for selecting a QSP for the exam which picks a QSP randomly. Moreover, a timestamp based lock is imposed on the scheme so that no one can decrypt the QSP before the allowed time. Finally, security is analyzed by proving different propositions and the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing schemes is proven through a comparative study based on the different features.",

    "abstract": "We present Fission, a new permissionless blockchain that achieves scalability in both terms of system throughput and transaction confirmation time, while at the same time, retaining blockchain's core values of equality and decentralization. Fission overcomes the system throughput bottleneck by employing a novel Eager-Lazy pipeling model that achieves very high system throughputs via block pipelining, an adaptive partitioning mechanism that auto-scales to transaction volumes, and a provably secure energy-efficient consensus protocol to ensure security and robustness. Fission applies a hybrid network which consists of a relay network, and a peer-to-peer network. The goal of the relay network is to minimize the transaction confirmation time by minimizing the information propagation latency. To optimize the performance on the relay network in the presence of churn, dynamic network topologies, and network heterogeneity, we propose an ultra-fast game-theoretic relay selection algorithm that achieves near-optimal performance in a fully distributed manner. Fission's peer-to-peer network complements the relay network and provides a very high data availability via enabling users to contribute their storage and bandwidth for information dissemination (with incentive). We propose a distributed online data retrieval strategy that optimally offloads the relay network without degrading the system performance. By re-innovating all the core elements of the blockchain technology - computation, networking, and storage - in a holistic manner, Fission aims to achieve the best balance among scalability, security and decentralization.",

The correctness of computation is verifiable even under malicious majority condition using information-theoretic Message Authentication Code (MAC), and the privacy is preserved using Secret-Sharing. With state-of-the-art multiparty computation protocol and a layer2 solution, our privacy-preserving computation guarantees data security on blockchain, cryptographically, while reducing the heavy-lifting computation job to a few nodes. This breakthrough has several implications on the future of decentralized networks. First, secure computation can be used to support Private Smart Contracts, where consensus is reached without exposing the information in the public contract. Second, it enables data to be shared and used in trustless network, without disclosing the raw data during data-at-use, where data ownership and data usage is safely separated. Last but not least, computation and verification processes are separated, which can be perceived as computational sharding, this effectively makes the transaction processing speed linear to the number of participating nodes. Our objective is to deploy our secure computation network as an layer2 solution to any blockchain system. Smart Contracts\\cite{smartcontract} will be used as bridge to link the blockchain and computation networks. Additionally, they will be used as verifier to ensure that outsourced computation is completed correctly. In order to achieve this, we first develop a general MPC network with advanced features, such as: 1) Secure Computation, 2) Off-chain Computation, 3) Verifiable Computation, and 4)Support dApps' needs like privacy-preserving data exchange.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains have recently gained popularity thanks to their ability to record \"digital truth\". They are designed to keep persistence, security, and avoid attacks which is useful for many applications. However, they are still problematic in their energy consumption, governance, and scalability Current solutions either require vast computing power via Proof-of-Work (PoW) or cannot directly utilize computing power as a resource in virtual mining. Here, we propose incentive-based protocols that use competitions to integrate computing power into blockchains. We introduce Proof-of-Accumulated-Work (PoAW): miners compete in costumer-submitted jobs, accumulate recorded work whenever they are successful, and, over time, are remunerated. The underlying competition replaces the standard hash puzzle-based competitions of PoW. A competition is managed by a dynamically-created small masternode network (dTMN) of invested miners. dTMNs allow for scalability as we do not need the entire network to manage the competition. Using careful design on incentives, our system preserves security, avoids attacks, and offers new markets to miners. When there are no costumers the system converges into a standard protocol. Our proposed solution improves the way by which the blockchain infrastructure works and makes use of its computing power. We also discuss how the protocol can be used by fields that require solving difficult optimization problems, such as Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition in Big Data.",

    "abstract": "The set of distributed ledger architectures known as blockchain is best known for cryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These permissionless block chains are showing the potential to be disruptive to the financial services industry. Their broader adoption is likely to be limited by the maximum block size, the cost of the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, and the increasing size of any given chain overwhelming most of the participating nodes. These factors have led to many cryptocurrency blockchains to become centralized in the nodes with enough computing power and storage to be a dominant miner and validator. Permissioned chains operate in trusted environments and can, therefore, avoid the computationally expensive consensus mechanisms. Permissioned chains are still susceptible to asset storage demands and non-standard user interfaces that will impede their adoption. This paper describes an approach to addressing these limitations: permissioned blockchain that uses off-chain storage of the data assets and this is accessed through a standard browser and mobile app. The implementation in the Hyperledger framework is described as is an example use of patient-centered health data management.",

    "abstract": "In the age of Big Data, enabling task scheduling while protecting users' privacy is critical for various decentralized applications in blockchain-based smart contract platforms. Such a privacy-preserving task scheduler requires the task input data to be secretly maintained until a prescribed task execution time and be automatically recorded into the blockchain to enabling the execution of the task at the execution time, even if the user goes offline. While straight-forward centralized approaches provide a basic solution to the problem, unfortunately they are limited to a single point of trust and involve a single point of control. This paper presents decentralized techniques for supporting privacy-preserving task scheduling using smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain networks. We design a privacy-preserving task scheduling protocol that is managed by a manager smart contract. The protocol requires a user to schedule a task by deploying a proxy smart contract maintaining the non-sensitive information of the task while creating decentralized secret trust and selecting trustees from the network to maintain the sensitive information of the task. With security techniques including secret sharing and layered encryption as well as security deposit paid by trustees as economic deterrence, the protocol can protect the sensitive information against possible attacks including some trustees destroying the sensitive information (drop attack) or secretly releasing the sensitive information before the execution time (release-ahead attack). We demonstrate the attack-resilience of the proposed protocol through rigorous analysis.Our implementation and experimental evaluation on the Ethereum official test network demonstrate the low monetary cost and the low time overhead associated with the proposed approach.",

IPFS is a distributed web based on a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open and focuses on public accessible files. To provide a solution for private file storage in the blockchain way, in this paper we propose a Merkle-tree-based File System (MTFS). In MTFS, the blockchain is more than a trust machine; it is an abstract of a cluster system. Distributed random nodes form a tree network cluster without a central controller to provide a secure private storage service and faster message propagation. Advance proxy re-encryption algorithm is applied to guarantee secure file exchanges under permission. Merkle tree will make sure that the files are distributed among the service nodes in a balanced way. The proposed MTFS can be used not only for personal file storage and exchange but also for industry requiring mutual trust in file uploading and downloading in making contracts like insurances.",

There are different consensus protocols for blockchain, like Proof of work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Space (PoSpace), Proof of Activities etc. But most of these consensus protocols are not designed for doing some useful jobs for society because of too much competition and scalability limitation. Massive electric power and computing resources, including CPU, RAM, storage and sensors have been wasted to run blockchain network based on these consensus protocols. Current frameworks and middleware for building decentralised applications (dApps) are largely limited to simple and less useful jobs. In this paper, we present Proofware which is designed for developers to build their dApps easily with existing public/crowd-based computing resources. Under Proofware, developers can develop and test their own Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) consensus protocols. Also, rather than depending on a centralised accounting system, each dApp has an embedded currency system to keep the whole incentive system decentralised, fair, transparent, stable and sustainable. Based on Proofware, we have built a crowd based video sharing application, called OurTube, as a case study. By the OurTube example, it has shown Proofware significantly improves the productivity to build crowd-based computing system with the features of cost-effectiveness, anti-censorship, elasticity and financial sustainability.",

    "abstract": "One decade ago, Bitcoin was introduced, becoming the first cryptocurrency and establishing the concept of \"blockchain\" as a distributed ledger. As of today, there are many different implementations of cryptocurrencies working over a blockchain, with different approaches and philosophies. However, many of them share one common feature: they require proof-of-work to support the generation of blocks (mining) and, eventually, the generation of money. This proof-of-work scheme often consists in the resolution of a cryptography problem, most commonly breaking a hash value, which can only be achieved through brute-force. The main drawback of proof-of-work is that it requires ridiculously large amounts of energy which do not have any useful outcome beyond supporting the currency. In this paper, we present a theoretical proposal that introduces a proof-of-useful-work scheme to support a cryptocurrency running over a blockchain, which we named Coin.AI. In this system, the mining scheme requires training deep learning models, and a block is only mined when the performance of such model exceeds a threshold. The distributed system allows for nodes to verify the models delivered by miners in an easy way (certainly much more efficiently than the mining process itself), determining when a block is to be generated. Additionally, this paper presents a proof-of-storage scheme for rewarding users that provide storage for the deep learning models, as well as a theoretical dissertation on how the mechanics of the system could be articulated with the ultimate goal of democratizing access to artificial intelligence.",

However, the existing news sharing networks may not provide security for data integrity and any third party may obstruct the regular flow of news sharing. Moreover, the existing news schemes are very vulnerable in case of disclosing the identity. Therefore, a universal platform is needed in the era of globalization where anyone can share and trade news from anywhere in the world securely, without the interference of third-party, and without disclosing the identity of an individual.

Similar to Bitcoin, Steemit is operated by a decentralized community, where 21 members are periodically elected to cooperatively operate the platform through the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol. Our study performed on 539 million operations performed by 1.12 million Steemit users during the period 2016/03 to 2018/08 reveals that the actual level of decentralization in Steemit is far lower than the ideal level, indicating that the DPoS consensus protocol may not be a desirable approach for establishing a highly decentralized social media platform. In Steemit, users create contents as posts which get curated based on votes from other users. The platform periodically issues cryptocurrency as rewards to creators and curators of popular posts. Although such a reward system is originally driven by the desire to incentivize users to contribute to high-quality contents, our analysis of the underlying cryptocurrency transfer network on the blockchain reveals that more than 16% transfers of cryptocurrency in Steemit are sent to curators suspected to be bots and also finds the existence of an underlying supply network for the bots, both suggesting a significant misuse of the current reward system in Steemit.

While the effect of SM has been studied mostly in a two-miners scenario, it has not been investigated in a more practical context where there are multiple malicious miners individually performing SM. To fill this gap, we carry out an empirical study that separately accounts for different numbers of SM miners (who always perform SM) and strategic miners (who choose either SM or Nakamoto's mining protocol depending on which maximises their individual mining reward). Our result shows that SM is generally more effective as the number of SM miners increases, however its effectiveness does not vary in the presence of a large number of strategic miners. Under specific mining power distributions, we also demonstrate that multiple miners can perform SM and simultaneously gain higher mining rewards than they should. Surprisingly, we also show that the more strategic miners there are, the more robust the systems become. Since blockchain miners should naturally be seen as self-interested strategic miners, our findings encourage blockchain system developers and engineers to attract as many miners as possible to prevent SM and similar behaviour.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the authors propose to increase the efficiency of blockchain mining by using a population-based approach. Blockchain relies on solving difficult mathematical problems as proof-of-work within a network before blocks are added to the chain. Brute force approach, advocated by some as the fastest algorithm for solving partial hash collisions and implemented in Bitcoin blockchain, implies exhaustive, sequential search. It involves incrementing the nonce (number) of the header by one, then taking a double SHA-256 hash at each instance and comparing it with a target value to ascertain if lower than that target. It excessively consumes both time and power. In this paper, the authors, therefore, suggest using an inner for-loop for the population-based approach. Comparison shows that it's a slightly faster approach than brute force, with an average speed advantage of about 1.67% or 3,420 iterations per second and 73% of the time performing better. Also, we observed that the more the total particles deployed, the better the performance until a pivotal point. Furthermore, a recommendation on taming the excessive use of power by networks, like Bitcoin's, by using penalty by consensus is suggested.",

Smart contracts hold and transfer significant amounts of digital currency which makes them an attractive target for security attacks. It has been shown that many contracts deployed to public ledgers contain security vulnerabilities. Moreover, the design of blockchain systems does not allow the code of the smart contract to be changed after it has been deployed to the system. Therefore, it is important to guarantee the correctness of smart contracts prior to their deployment. Formal verification is widely used to check smart contracts for correctness with respect to given specification. In this work we consider program synthesis techniques in which the specification is used to generate correct-by-construction programs. We focus on one of the special cases of program synthesis where programs are modeled with finite state machines (FSMs). We show how FSM synthesis can be applied to the problem of automatic smart contract generation. Several case studies of smart contracts are outlined: crowdfunding platform, blinded auction and a license contract. For each case study we specify the corresponding smart contract with a set of formulas in linear temporal logic (LTL) and use this specification together with test scenarios to synthesize a FSM model for that contract.

    "abstract": "Financial institutions are currently looking into technologies for permissioned blockchains. A major effort in this direction is Hyperledger, an open source project hosted by the Linux Foundation and backed by a consortium of over a hundred companies. A key component in permissioned blockchain protocols is a byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus engine that orders transactions. However, currently available BFT solutions in Hyperledger (as well as in the literature at large) are inadequate for financial settings; they are not designed to ensure fairness or to tolerate selfish behavior that arises when financial institutions strive to maximize their own profit. We present FairLedger, a permissioned blockchain BFT protocol, which is fair, designed to deal with rational behavior, and, no less important, easy to understand and implement. The secret sauce of our protocol is a new communication abstraction, called detectable all-to-all (DA2A), which allows us to detect participants (byzantine or rational) that deviate from the protocol, and punish them. We implement FairLedger in the Hyperledger open source project, using Iroha framework, one of the biggest projects therein. To evaluate FairLegder's performance, we also implement it in the PBFT framework and compare the two protocols. Our results show that in failure-free scenarios FairLedger achieves better throughput than both Iroha's implementation and PBFT in wide-area settings.",

    "abstract": "There is surge of interest to the blockchain technology not only in the scientific community but in the business community as well. Proof of Work (PoW) and Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) are the two main classes of consensus protocols that are used in the blockchain consensus layer. PoW is highly scalable but very slow with about 7 (transactions/second) performance. BFT based protocols are highly efficient but their scalability are limited to only tens of nodes. One of the main reasons for the BFT limitation is the quadratic $O(n^2)$ communication complexity of BFT based protocols for $n$ nodes that requires $n \\times n$ broadcasting. In this paper, we present the {\\em Musch} protocol which is BFT based and provides communication complexity $O(f n + n)$ for $f$ failures and $n$ nodes, where $f < n/3$, without compromising the latency. Hence, the performance adjusts to $f$ such that for constant $f$ the communication complexity is linear. Musch achieves this by introducing the notion of exponentially increasing windows of nodes to which complains are reported, instead of broadcasting to all the nodes. To our knowledge, this is the first BFT-based blockchain protocol which efficiently addresses simultaneously the issues of communication complexity and latency under the presence of failures.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine general problem is the core problem of the consensus algorithm, and many protocols are proposed recently to improve the decentralization level, the performance and the security of the blockchain. There are two challenging issues when the blockchain is operating in practice. First, the outcomes of the consensus algorithm are usually related to the incentive model, so whether each participant's value has an equal probability of being chosen becomes essential. However, the issues of fairness are not captured in the traditional security definition of Byzantine agreement. Second, the blockchain should be resistant to network failures, such as cloud services shut down or malicious attack, while remains the high performance most of the time. This paper has two main contributions. First, we propose a novel notion called fair validity for Byzantine agreement. Intuitively, fair validity lower-bounds the expected numbers that honest nodes' values being decided if the protocol is executed many times. However, we also show that any Byzantine agreement could not achieve fair validity in an asynchronous network, so we focus on synchronous protocols. This leads to our second contribution: we propose a fair, responsive and partition-resilient Byzantine agreement protocol tolerating up to 1/3 corruptions. Fairness means that our protocol achieves fair validity. Responsiveness means that the termination time only depends on the actual network delay instead of depending on any pre-determined time bound. Partition-resilience means that the safety still holds even if the network is partitioned, and the termination will hold if the partition is resolved.",

Proof-of-work provides a solution by linking representation to a valuable, physical resource. While this has worked well, it uses a tremendous amount of specialized hardware and energy, with no utility beyond blockchain security. Here, we propose an alternative consensus scheme that directs the computational resources to the optimization of machine learning (ML) models, a task with more general utility. This is achieved by a hybrid consensus scheme relying on three parties: data providers, miners, and a committee. The data provider makes data available and provides payment in return for the best model, miners compete about the payment and access to the committee by producing ML optimized models, and the committee controls the ML competition.",

    "abstract": "Ethereum has become a widely used platform to enable secure, Blockchain-based financial and business transactions. However, a major concern in Ethereum is the security of its smart contracts. Many identified bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts not only present challenges to maintenance of blockchain, but also lead to serious financial loses. There is a significant need to better assist developers in checking smart contracts and ensuring their reliability.In this paper, we propose a web service tool, named SmartEmbed, which can help Solidity developers to find repetitive contract code and clone-related bugs in smart contracts. Our tool is based on code embeddings and similarity checking techniques. By comparing the similarities among the code embedding vectors for existing solidity code in the Ethereum blockchain and known bugs, we are able to efficiently identify code clones and clone-related bugs for any solidity code given by users, which can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of their code. In addition to the uses by individual developers, SmartEmbed can also be applied to studies of smart contracts in a large scale. When applied to more than 22K solidity contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain, we found that the clone ratio of solidity code is close to 90\\%, much higher than traditional software, and 194 clone-related bugs can be identified efficiently and accurately based on our small bug database with a precision of 96\\%. SmartEmbed can be accessed at \\url{http://www.smartembed.net}. A demo video of SmartEmbed is at \\url{https://youtu.be/o9ylyOpYFq8}",

While facilitating the easy exchanges of real-time IoT data streams between device owners and third-party applications through the marketplace, I3 is presently a monolithic, centralized platform for a single community. Although the service oriented architecture (SOA) has been widely adopted in the IoT and cyber-physical systems (CPS), it is difficult for a monolithic architecture to provide scalable, inter-operable and extensible services for large numbers of distributed IoT devices and different application vendors. Traditional security solutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be a performance bottleneck or susceptible to a single point of failure. Inspired by containerized microservices and blockchain technology, this paper proposed a BLockchain-ENabled Secure Microservices for Decentralized Data Marketplaces (BlendSM-DDM). Within a permissioned blockchain network, a microservices based security mechanism is introduced to secure data exchange and payment among participants in the marketplace. BlendSM-DDM is able to offer a decentralized, scalable and auditable data exchanges for the data marketplace.",

The execution of smart contracts is paid in the form of gas, which is a monetary unit used in the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) provides the metering capability for smart contract execution. Instruction costs vary depending on the instruction type and the approximate computational resources required to execute the instruction on the network. The cost of gas is adjusted using transaction fees to ensure adequate payment of the network. In this work, we highlight the \"real\" economics of smart contracts. We show that the actual costs of executing smart contracts are disproportionate to the computational costs and that this gap is continuously widening. We show that the gas cost-model of the underlying EVM instruction-set is wrongly modeled. Specifically, the computational cost for the SLOAD instruction increases with the length of the blockchain. Our proposed performance model estimates gas usage and execution time of a smart contract at a given block-height. The new gas-cost model incorporates the block-height to eliminate irregularities in the Ethereum gas calculations. Our findings are based on extensive experiments over the entire history of the EVM blockchain.",

Among them, phishing scams on blockchain have been found making a notable amount of money, thus emerging as a serious threat to the trading security of the blockchain ecosystem. In order to create a favorable environment for investment, an effective method for detecting phishing scams is urgently needed in the blockchain ecosystem. To this end, this paper proposes an approach to detect phishing scams on Ethereum by mining its transaction records. Specifically, we first crawl the labeled phishing addresses from two authorized websites and reconstruct the transaction network according to the collected transaction records. Then, by taking the transaction amount and timestamp into consideration, we propose a novel network embedding algorithm called trans2vec to extract the features of the addresses for subsequent phishing identification. Finally, we adopt the oneclass support vector machine (SVM) to classify the nodes into normal and phishing ones. Experimental results demonstrate that the phishing detection method works effectively on Ethereum, and indicate the efficacy of trans2vec over existing state-of-the-art algorithms on feature extraction for transaction networks. This work is the first investigation on phishing detection on Ethereum via network embedding and provides insights into how features of large-scale transaction networks can be embedded.",

In due course with the ever-evolving nature of newer statistical techniques infringing user privacy, machine learning models with algorithms built with respect for user privacy can offer a dynamically adaptive solution to preserve user privacy against the exponentially increasing multidimensional relationships that datasets create. Using these privacy aware ML Models at the core of a Federated Learning Ecosystem can enable the entire network to learn from data in a decentralized manner. By harnessing the ever-increasing computational power of mobile devices, increasing network reliability and IoT devices revolutionizing the smart devices industry, and combining it with a secure and scalable, global learning session backed by a blockchain network with the ability to ensure on-device privacy, we allow any Internet enabled device to participate and contribute data to a global privacy preserving, data sharing network with blockchain technology even allowing the network to reward quality work. This network architecture can also be built on top of existing blockchain networks like Ethereum and Hyperledger, this lets even small startups build enterprise ready decentralized solutions allowing anyone to learn from data across different departments of a company, all the way to thousands of devices participating in a global synchronized learning network.",

The protocol will incur some cost to run while in the end (or at regular intervals), it will populate and update local tables that assign (virtual) rewards to participants. Each participant aspires to offset the costs of participation by these virtual payoffs that are provided in the course of the protocol. In this setting, we introduce and study a notion of coalition-safe equilibrium. In particular, we consider a strategic coalition of participants that is centrally coordinated and potentially deviates from $\\Pi$ with the objective to increase its utility with respect to the view of {\\em at least one} of the other participants. The protocol $\\Pi$ is called a coalition-safe equilibrium with virtual payoffs (EVP) if no such protocol deviation exists. We apply our notion to study incentives in blockchain protocols. We proceed to use our framework to provide a unified picture of incentives in the Bitcoin blockchain, for absolute and relative rewards based utility functions, as well as prove novel results regarding incentives of the Fruitchain blockchain protocol [PODC 2017] showing that the equilibrium condition holds for collusions up to $n-1$ players for absolute rewards based utility functions and less than $n/2$ for relative rewards based utility functions, with the latter result holding for any \"weakly fair\" blockchain protocol, a new property that we introduce and may be of independent interest.",

Its decoupling idea has inspired a new generation of high-performance blockchain protocols. However, the existing incentive analysis of Bitcoin-NG has several limitations. First, the impact of network capacity is ignored. Second, an integrated incentive analysis that jointly considers both key blocks and microblocks is still missing. In this paper, we aim to address these two limitations. First, we propose a new incentive analysis that takes the network capacity into account, showing that Bitcoin-NG can still maintain incentive compatibility against the microblock mining attack even under limited network capacity. Second, we leverage a Markov decision process (MDP) to jointly analyze the incentive of both key blocks and microblocks, showing that the selfish mining revenue of Bitcoin-NG is a little higher than that in Bitcoin only when the selfish miner controls more than 35\\% of the mining power. We hope that our in-depth incentive analysis for Bitcoin-NG can shed some light on the mechanism design and incentive analysis of next-generation blockchain protocols.",

The system must maintain a large Shard size (the number of nodes inside a Shard) to sustain the low failure probability so that only a small number of Shards may exist. In this paper, we present a new approach of Blockchain Sharding that can withstand up to n/2 of nodes being bad. We categorise the nodes into different classes, and every Shard has a fixed number of nodes from different classes. We prove that this design is much more secure than the traditional models (only have one class) and the Shard size can be reduced significantly. In this way, many more Shards can exist, and the transaction throughput can be largely increased. The improved Blockchain Sharding approach is promising to serve as the foundation for decentralised autonomous organisations and decentralised database.",

This paper extends out presentation of Flow, a pipelined blockchain architecture, which separates the process of consensus on the transaction order from transaction computation. As we experimentally showed in our previous white paper, our architecture provides a significant throughput improvement while preserving the security of the system. Flow exploits the heterogeneity offered by the nodes, in terms of bandwidth, storage, and computational capacity, and defines the roles for the nodes based on their tasks in the pipeline, i.e., Collector, Consensus, Execution, and Verification. While transaction collection from the user agents is completed through the bandwidth-optimized Collector Nodes, the execution of them is done by the compute-optimized Execution Nodes. Checking the execution result is then distributed among a more extensive set of Verification Nodes, which confirm the result is correct in a distributed and parallel manner. In contrast to more traditional blockchain architectures, Flow's Consensus Nodes do not execute the transaction. Instead, Verification Nodes report observed faulty executions to the Consensus Nodes, which adjudicate the received challenges and slash malicious actors. In this paper, we detail the lifecycle of the transactions from the submission to the system until they are getting executed. The paper covers the Collector, Consensus, and Execution role. We provide a protocol specification of collecting the transactions, forming a block, and executing the resulting block. Moreover, we elaborate on the safety and liveness of the system concerning these processes.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, smart contracts have suffered major exploits, costing millions of dollars. Unlike traditional programs, smart contracts are deployed on a blockchain. As such, they cannot be modified once deployed. Though various tools have been proposed to detect vulnerable smart contracts, the majority fails to protect vulnerable contracts that have already been deployed on the blockchain. Only very few solutions have been proposed so far to tackle the issue of post-deployment. However, these solutions suffer from low precision and are not generic enough to prevent any type of attack. In this work, we introduce {\\AE}GIS, a dynamic analysis tool that protects smart contracts from being exploited during runtime. Its capability of detecting new vulnerabilities can easily be extended through so-called attack patterns. These patterns are written in a domain-specific language that is tailored to the execution model of Ethereum smart contracts. The language enables the description of malicious control and data flows. In addition, we propose a novel mechanism to streamline and speed up the process of managing attack patterns. Patterns are voted upon and stored via a smart contract, thus leveraging the benefits of tamper-resistance and transparency provided by the blockchain. We compare {\\AE}GIS to current state-of-the-art tools and demonstrate that our solution achieves higher precision in detecting attacks. Finally, we perform a large-scale analysis on the first 4.5 million blocks of the Ethereum blockchain, thereby confirming the occurrences of well reported and yet unreported attacks in the wild.",

However, the issue of BFL is that the mobile devices have energy and CPU constraints that may reduce the system lifetime and training efficiency. The other issue is that the training latency may increase due to the blockchain mining process. To address these issues, the MLMO needs to (i) decide how much data and energy that the mobile devices use for the training and (ii) determine the block generation rate to minimize the system latency, energy consumption, and incentive cost while achieving the target accuracy for the model. Under the uncertainty of the BFL environment, it is challenging for the MLMO to determine the optimal decisions.

This study propose a blockchain-based framework which investigate the possibility of utilizing peer-to peer, time stamping, and decentralized storage advantages of blockchain to build a new system for verifying and detecting the unknown infected cases of COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the proposed framework will enable the citizens to predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus within conglomerates of people or within public places through a novel design of P2P-Mobile Application. The proposed approach is forecasted to produce an effective system able to support governments, health authorities, and citizens to take critical decision regarding the infection detection, infection prediction, and infection avoidance. The framework is currently being developed and implemented as a new system consists of four components, Infection Verifier Subsystem, Blockchain platform, P2P-Mobile Application, and Mass-Surveillance System. This four components work together for detecting the unknown infected cases and predicting and estimating the infection Risk of Corona Virus (COVID-19).",

    "abstract": "Advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), dynamic data driven application systems (DDDAS), and hierarchical cloud-fog-edge computing paradigm provide opportunities for enhancing multi-domain systems performance. As one example that represents multi-domain scenario, a \"fly-by-feel\" system utilizes DDDAS framework to support autonomous operations and improve maneuverability, safety and fuel efficiency. The DDDAS \"fly-by-feel\" avionics system can enhance multi-domain coordination to support domain specific operations. However, conventional enabling technologies rely on a centralized manner for data aggregation, sharing and security policy enforcement, and it incurs critical issues related to bottleneck of performance, data provenance and consistency. Inspired by the containerized microservices and blockchain technology, this paper introduces BLEM, a hybrid BLockchain-Enabled secure Microservices fabric to support decentralized, secure and efficient data fusion and multi-domain operations for avionics systems. Leveraging the fine-granularity and loose-coupling features of the microservices architecture, multidomain operations and security functionalities are decoupled into multiple containerized microservices. A hybrid blockchain fabric based on two-level committee consensus protocols is proposed to enable decentralized security architecture and support immutability, auditability and traceability for data provenience in existing multi-domain avionics system. Our evaluation results show the feasibility of the proposed BLEM mechanism to support decentralized security service and guarantee immutability, auditability and traceability for data provenience across domain boundaries.",

It allows the trade to be open, transparent with immutable transactions that can be used for settling any disputes. The paper presents a case study of applying the framework for a shopping cart as one of the enterprise nodes of MultiChain which provides trading in ethers controlled by smart contracts and also collects user profile data and allows them to receive rewards for sharing their data with other business enterprises. It tracks who shared what, with whom, when, by what means and for what purposes in a verifiable fashion. The user data from the repository is converted into an open data format and shared via stream in the blockchain so that other nodes can efficiently process and use the data. The smart contract verifies and executes the agreed terms of use of the data and transfers digital tokens as a reward to the customer. The smart contract imposes double deposit collateral to ensure that all participants act honestly.",

In this paper, we introduce BlockRoam, a novel blockchain-based roaming management system that provides an efficient data exchange platform among MSPs and mobile subscribers. Utilizing the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and smart contracts, BlockRoam can significantly shorten the information exchanging delay, thereby addressing the roaming fraud problems. Through intensive analysis, we show that the security and performance of such PoS-based blockchain network can be further enhanced by incentivizing more users (e.g., subscribers) to participate in the network. Moreover, users in such networks often join stake pools (e.g., formed by MSPs) to increase their profits. Therefore, we develop an economic model based on Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the profits of the network users and the stake pool, thereby encouraging user participation. We also propose an effective method to guarantee the uniqueness of this game's equilibrium. The performance evaluations show that the proposed economic model helps the MSPs to earn additional profits, attracts more investment to the blockchain network, and enhances the network's security and performance.",

    "abstract": "With the development of smart cities, not only are all corners of the city connected to each other, but also connected from city to city. They form a large distributed network together, which can facilitate the integration of distributed energy station (DES) and corresponding smart aggregators. Nevertheless, because of potential security and privacy protection arisen from trustless energies trading, how to make such energies trading goes smoothly is a tricky challenge. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based multiple energies trading (B-MET) system for secure and efficient energies trading by executing a smart contract we design. Because energies trading requires the blockchain in B-MET system to have high throughput and low latency, we design a new byzantine-based consensus mechanism (BCM) based on node's credit to improve efficiency for the consortium blockchain under the B-MET system. Then, we take combined heat and power (CHP) system as a typical example that provides distributed energies. We quantify their utilities, and model the interactions between aggregators and DESs in a smart city by a novel multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. It is analyzed and solved by reaching Nash equilibrium between aggregators, which reflects the competition between aggregators to purchase energies from DESs. In the end, we conduct plenty of numerical simulations to evaluate and verify our proposed model and algorithms, which demonstrate their correctness and efficiency completely.",

In this paper, we present a blockchain-enabled privacy-preserving contact tracing scheme: BeepTrace, where we propose to adopt blockchain bridging the user/patient and the authorized solvers to desensitize the user ID and location information. Compared with recently proposed contract tracing solutions, our approach shows higher security and privacy with the additional advantages of being battery friendly and globally accessible. Results show viability in terms of the required resource at both server and mobile phone perspectives. Through breaking the privacy concerns of the public, the proposed BeepTrace solution can provide a timely framework for authorities, companies, software developers and researchers to fast develop and deploy effective digital contact tracing applications, to conquer COVID-19 pandemic soon. Meanwhile, the open initiative of BeepTrace allows worldwide collaborations, integrate existing tracing and positioning solutions with the help of blockchain technology.",

    "abstract": "Proof-of-Work~(PoW) based blockchains typically allocate only a tiny fraction (e.g., less than 1% for Ethereum) of the average interarrival time~($\\mathbb{I}$) between blocks for validating transactions. A trivial increase in validation time~($\\tau$) introduces the popularly known Verifier's Dilemma, and as we demonstrate, causes more forking and increases unfairness. Large $\\tau$ also reduces the tolerance for safety against a Byzantine adversary. Solutions that offload validation to a set of non-chain nodes (a.k.a. off-chain approaches) suffer from trust issues that are non-trivial to resolve. In this paper, we present Tuxedo, the first on-chain protocol to theoretically scale $\\tau/\\mathbb{I} \\approx 1$ in PoW blockchains. The key innovation in Tuxedo is to separate the consensus on the ordering of transactions from their execution. We achieve this by allowing miners to delay validation of transactions in a block by up to $\\zeta$ blocks, where $\\zeta$ is a system parameter. We perform security analysis of Tuxedo considering all possible adversarial strategies in a synchronous network with end-to-end delay $\\Delta$ and demonstrate that Tuxedo achieves security equivalent to known results for longest chain PoW Nakamoto consensus. Additionally, we also suggest a principled approach for practical choices of parameter $\\zeta$ as per the application requirement. Our prototype implementation of Tuxedo atop Ethereum demonstrates that it can scale $\\tau$ without suffering the harmful effects of naive scaling in existing blockchains.",

It takes high cost to achieve the calculation of this problem in devices of IOT, especially the mobile devices of IOT. It consequently restricts the application of blockchain in mobile environment. However, edge computing can be utilized to solve the problem for insufficient computing power of mobile devices in IOT. Edge servers can recruit many mobile devices to contribute computing power together to mining and share the reward of mining with these recruited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose an incentivizing mechanism based on edge computing for mobile blockchain. We design a two-stage Stackelberg Game to jointly optimize the reward of edge servers and recruited mobile devices. The edge server as the leader sets the expected fee for the recruited mobile devices in Stage I. The mobile device as a follower provides its computing power to mine according to the expected fee in Stage. It proves that this game can obtain a uniqueness Nash Equilibrium solution under the same or different expected fee. In the simulation experiment, we obtain a result curve of the profit for the edge server with the different ratio between the computing power from the edge server and mobile devices. In addition, the proposed scheme has been compared with the MDG scheme for the profit of the edge server. The experimental results show that the profit of the proposed scheme is more than that of the MDG scheme under the same total computing power.",

    "abstract": "A key performance metric in blockchains is the latency between when a transaction is broadcast and when it is confirmed (the so-called, confirmation latency). While improvements in consensus techniques can lead to lower confirmation latency, a fundamental lower bound on confirmation latency is the propagation latency of messages through the underlying peer-to-peer (p2p) network (inBitcoin, the propagation latency is several tens of seconds). The de facto p2p protocol used by Bitcoin and other blockchains is based on random connectivity: each node connects to a random subset of nodes. The induced p2p network topology can be highly suboptimal since it neglects geographical distance, differences in bandwidth, hash-power and computational abilities across peers. We present Perigee, a decentralized algorithm that automatically learns an efficient p2p topology tuned to the aforementioned network heterogeneities, purely based on peers' interactions with their neighbors. Motivated by the literature on the multi-armed bandit problem, Perigee optimally balances the tradeoff between retaining connections to known well-connected neighbors, and exploring new connections to previously-unseen neighbors. Experimental evaluations show that Perigee reduces the latency to broadcast by $33\\%$. Lastly Perigee is simple, computationally lightweight, adversary-resistant, and compatible with the selfish interests of peers, making it an attractive p2p protocol for blockchains.",

There is a need for a verification framework that various authorities can request a verification service for the local network data of a target IoT device. In this paper, we leverage blockchain as a distributed platform to realize an on-demand verification scheme. This allows authorities to automatically transact with connected devices for witnessing services. A public request is made for witness statements on the data of a target IoT that is transmitted on its local network, and subsequently, devices (in close vicinity of the target IoT) offer witnessing service. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We develop a system architecture based on blockchain and smart contract that enables authorities to dynamically avail a verification service for data of a subject device from a distributed set of witnesses which are willing to provide (in a privacy-preserving manner) their local wireless measurement in exchange of monetary return; (2) We then develop a method to optimally select witnesses in such a way that the verification error is minimized subject to monetary cost constraints; (3) Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of our scheme using real Wi-Fi session traces collected from a five-storeyed building with more than thirty access points, representative of a hospital. According to the current pricing schedule of the Ethereum public blockchain, our scheme enables healthcare authorities to verify data transmitted from a typical wearable device with the verification error of the order 0.01% at cost of less than two dollars for one-hour witnessing service.",

    "abstract": "Academic publication of latest research results are crucial to advance development of all disciplines. However, there are a number of severe disadvantages in current academic publication systems. The first problem is the misconduct during the publication process due to the opaque paper review process. An anonymous reviewer may give biased comments to a paper without being noticed or punished, because the comments are seldom published for evaluation. Secondly, the author anonymity during the paper review process is easily compromised since this information is simply open to the conference chair or the journal editor. Last but not least, access to research papers is restricted to only subscribers, and even the authors cannot access their own papers. In this paper, we propose Open-Pub, a decentralized, transparent yet privacy-preserving academic publication scheme using the blockchain technology, aiming to reduce academic misconducts and promote free sharing of research results. To this end, we design a threshold group signature to achieve anonymity for reviewers and authors. With this group signature, authors can choose to submit papers anonymously and validators take turns to distribute papers anonymously to reviewers on the blockchain according to their research interests. After the reviewers submit their review comments, the identities of reviewers and anonymous authors will be disclosed. These processes will be recorded on the blockchain so that everyone can trace the entire process. To evaluate its efficiency, we implement Open-Pub based on Ethereum source code and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate its performance, including computation cost and processing delay. The experiment results show that Open-Pub is highly efficient in computation and processing anonymous transactions.",

Using identified features, we train various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and identify the algorithm that performs the best in detecting which accounts are malicious. We then study the behavior of the accounts over different temporal granularities of the dataset before assigning them malicious tags. For Ethereum blockchain, we identify that for the entire dataset - the ExtraTreesClassifier performs the best among supervised ML algorithms. On the other hand, using cosine similarity on top of the results provided by unsupervised ML algorithms such as K-Means on the entire dataset, we were able to detect 554 more suspicious accounts.

Later on, researchers proposed several variants of differential privacy in order to preserve privacy in certain other scenarios, such as real-time cyber physical systems. Since then, differential privacy has rigorously been applied to certain other domains which has the need of privacy preservation. One such domain is decentralized blockchain based smart metering, in which smart meters acting as blockchain nodes sent their real-time data to grid utility databases for real-time reporting. This data is further used to carry out statistical tasks, such as load forecasting, demand response calculation, etc. However, in case if any intruder gets access to this data it can leak privacy of smart meter users. In this context, differential privacy can be used to protect privacy of this data. In this chapter, we carry out comparison of four variants of differential privacy (Laplace, Gaussian, Uniform, and Geometric) in blockchain based smart metering scenario. We test these variants on smart metering data and carry out their performance evaluation by varying different parameters. Experimental outcomes shows at low privacy budget ($\\varepsilon$) and at low reading sensitivity value ($\\delta$), these privacy preserving mechanisms provide high privacy by adding large amount of noise. However, among these four privacy preserving parameters Geometric parameters is more suitable for protecting high peak values and Laplace mechanism is more suitable for protecting low peak values at ($\\varepsilon$ = 0.01).",

In the absence of particular medication and vaccines, tracing and isolating the source of infection is the best option to slow the spread of the virus and reduce infection and death rates among the population. There are three main obstacles in the process of tracing the infection: 1) Patient's electronic health record is stored in a traditional centralized database that could be stolen and tampered with the infection data, 2) The confidential personal identity of the infected user may be revealed to a third party or organization, 3) Existing infection tracing systems do not trace infections from multiple dimensions. Either the system is location-based or individual-based tracing. In this work, we propose a global COVID-19 information sharing system that utilizes the Blockchain, Smart Contract, and Bluetooth technologies. The proposed system unifies location-based and Bluetooth-based contact tracing services into the Blockchain platform, where the automatically executed smart contracts are deployed so that users can get consistent and non-tamperable virus trails. The anonymous functionality provided by the Blockchain and Bluetooth technology protects the user's identity privacy. With our proposed analysis formula for estimating the probability of infection, users can take measures to protect themselves in advance. We also implement a prototype system to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has been forming the central piece of various types of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) network for trusted data exchange. Recently, permissioned blockchains garner particular attention thanks to their improved scalability and diverse needs from different organizations. One representative example of permissioned blockchain is Hyperledger Fabric (\"Fabric\"). Due to its unique execute-order procedure, there is a critical need for a client to select an optimal number of peers. The interesting problem that this paper targets to address is the tradeoff in the number of peers: a too large number will degrade scalability while a too small number will make the network vulnerable to faulty nodes. This optimization issue gets especially challenging in V2X networks due to mobility of nodes: a transaction must be executed and the associated block must be committed before the vehicle leaves a network. To this end, this paper proposes an optimal peers selection mechanism based on reinforcement learning (RL) to keep a Fabric-empowered V2X network impervious to dynamicity due to mobility. We model the RL as a contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. The results demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed scheme.",

However, large-scale FEL still faces following crucial challenges: (i) there lacks a secure and communication-efficient model training scheme for FEL; (2) there is no scalable and flexible FEL framework for updating local models and global model sharing (trading) management. To bridge the gaps, we first propose a blockchain-empowered secure FEL system with a hierarchical blockchain framework consisting of a main chain and subchains. This framework can achieve scalable and flexible decentralized FEL by individually manage local model updates or model sharing records for performance isolation. A Proof-of-Verifying consensus scheme is then designed to remove low-quality model updates and manage qualified model updates in a decentralized and secure manner, thereby achieving secure FEL. To improve communication efficiency of the blockchain-empowered FEL, a gradient compression scheme is designed to generate sparse but important gradients to reduce communication overhead without compromising accuracy, and also further strengthen privacy preservation of training data. The security analysis and numerical results indicate that the proposed schemes can achieve secure, scalable, and communication-efficient decentralized FEL.",

    "abstract": "The targeted advertising is based on preference profiles inferred via relationships among individuals, their monitored responses to previous advertising and temporal activity over the Internet, which has raised critical privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a novel proposal for a Blockchain-based advertising platform that provides: a system for privacy preserving user profiling, privately requesting ads from the advertising system, the billing mechanisms for presented and clicked ads, the advertising system that uploads ads to the cloud according to profiling interests, various types of transactions to enable advertising operations in Blockchain-based network, and the method that allows a cloud system to privately compute the access policies for various resources (such as ads, mobile user profiles). Our main goal is to design a decentralized framework for targeted ads, which enables private delivery of ads to users whose behavioral profiles accurately match the presented ads, defined by the ad system. We implement a POC of our proposed framework i.e. a Bespoke Miner and experimentally evaluate various components of Blockchain-based in-app advertising system, implementing various critical components; such as, evaluating user profiles, implementing access policies, encryption and decryption of users' profiles. We observe that the processing delay for traversing policies of various tree sizes, the encryption/decryption time of user profiling with various key-sizes and user profiles of various interests evaluates to an acceptable amount of processing time as that of the currently implemented ad systems.",

    "abstract": "Steemit is a blockchain-based social media platform, where authors can get author rewards in the form of cryptocurrencies called STEEM and SBD (Steem Blockchain Dollars) if their posts are upvoted. Interestingly, curators (or voters) can also get rewards by voting others' posts, which is called a curation reward. A reward is proportional to a curator's STEEM stakes. Throughout this process, Steemit hopes \"good\" content will be automatically discovered by users in a decentralized way, which is known as the Proof-of-Brain (PoB). However, there are many bot accounts programmed to post automatically and get rewards, which discourages real human users from creating good content. We call this type of bot a posting bot. While there are many papers that studied bots on traditional centralized social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, we are the first to study posting bots on a blockchain-based social media platform. Compared with the bot detection on the usual social media platforms, the features we created have an advantage that posting bots can be detected without limiting the number or length of posts. We can extract the features of posts by clustering distances between blog data or replies. These features are obtained from the Minimum Average Cluster from Clustering Distance between Frequent words and Articles (MAC-CDFA), which is not used in any of the previous social media research. Based on the enriched features, we enhanced the quality of classification tasks. Comparing the F1-scores, the features we created outperformed the features used for bot detection on Facebook and Twitter.",

    "abstract": "Device failure detection is one of most essential problems in industrial internet of things (IIoT). However, in conventional IIoT device failure detection, client devices need to upload raw data to the central server for model training, which might lead to disclosure of sensitive business data. Therefore, in this paper, to ensure client data privacy, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning approach for device failure detection in IIoT. First, we present a platform architecture of blockchain-based federated learning systems for failure detection in IIoT, which enables verifiable integrity of client data. In the architecture, each client periodically creates a Merkle tree in which each leaf node represents a client data record, and stores the tree root on a blockchain. Further, to address the data heterogeneity issue in IIoT failure detection, we propose a novel centroid distance weighted federated averaging (CDW\\_FedAvg) algorithm taking into account the distance between positive class and negative class of each client dataset. In addition, to motivate clients to participate in federated learning, a smart contact based incentive mechanism is designed depending on the size and the centroid distance of client data used in local model training. A prototype of the proposed architecture is implemented with our industry partner, and evaluated in terms of feasibility, accuracy and performance. The results show that the approach is feasible, and has satisfactory accuracy and performance.",

    "abstract": "Increasing awareness of privacy-preserving has led to a strong focus on anonymous systems protecting anonymity. By studying early schemes, we summarize some intractable problems of anonymous systems. Centralization setting is a universal problem since most anonymous system rely on central proxies or presetting nodes to forward and mix messages, which compromises users' privacy in some way. Besides, availability becomes another important factor limiting the development of anonymous system due to the large requirement of additional additional resources (i.e. bandwidth and storage) and high latency. Moreover, existing anonymous systems may suffer from different attacks including abominable Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, Distributed Denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and so on. In this context, we first come up with a BlockChain-based Mix-Net (BCMN) protocol and theoretically demonstrate its security and anonymity. Then we construct a concrete dynamic self-organizing BlockChain-based MIX anonymous system (BCMIX). In the system, users and mix nodes utilize the blockchain transactions and their addresses to negotiate keys with each other, which can resist the MitM attacks. In addition, we design an IP sharding algorithm to mitigate Sybil attacks. To evaluate the BCMIX system, we leverage the distribution of mining pools in the real world to test the system's performance and ability to resistant attacks. Compared with other systems, BCMIX provides better resilience to known attacks, while achieving low latency anonymous communication without significant bandwidth or storage resources.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin introduced delegation of control over a monetary system from a select few to all who participate in that system. This delegation is known as the decentralization of controlling power and is a powerful security mechanism for the ecosystem. After the introduction of Bitcoin, the field of cryptocurrency has seen widespread attention from industry and academia, so much so that the original novel contribution of Bitcoin i.e. decentralization, may be overlooked, due to decentralizations assumed fundamental existence for the functioning of such cryptoassets. However recent studies have observed a trend of increased centralization in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. As this increased centralization has an impact the security of the blockchain, it is crucial that it is measured, towards adequate control. This research derives an initial taxonomy of centralization present in decentralized blockchains through rigorous synthesis using a systematic literature review. This is followed by iterative refinement through expert interviews. We systematically analyzed 89 research papers published between 2009 and 2019. Our study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the multiple definitions and measurements of centralization in the literature. We identify different aspects of centralization and propose an encompassing taxonomy of centralization concerns. This taxonomy is based on empirically observable and measurable characteristics. It consists of 13 aspects of centralization classified over six architectural layers Governance Network Consensus Incentive Operational and Application. We also discuss how the implications of centralization can vary depending on the aspects studied. We believe that this review and taxonomy provides a comprehensive overview of centralization in decentralized blockchains involving various conceptualizations and measures.",

In the first approach, a mathematical model has derived for optimal transaction throughput for PoW based longest chain rule blockchain. In this approach, the blockchain Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network is considered as Erd \\\"o s - R \\'e nyi random network topology. This approach is however limited by the block creation rate, the results suggest that the rate beyond an optimal point can result in unfairness in the system. The second approach is a new consensus protocol proposed by considering the ledger as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) called blockDAG instead of a chain of blocks. In this framework, we follow a two-step strategy that makes the system robust enough to handle the double-spend attacks. The first step involves the development of an unsupervised learning graph clustering algorithm for separating the blocks created by an attacker. In the second step, the attackers blocks are eliminated and the remaining blocks are arranged in topological order by honest clients which makes the blockDAG system suitable for smart contract applications found in Internet of Things (IoT) services. The Simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement in the transaction throughput compared to bitcoin.",

    "abstract": "In Tendermint blockchains, the proof-of-stake mechanism and the underlying consensus algorithm entail a dynamic fault model that implies that the active validators (nodes that sign blocks) may change over time, and a quorum of these validators is assumed to be correct only for a limited period of time (called trusting period). The changes of the validator set are under control of the blockchain application, and are committed in every block. In order to check what is the state of the blockchain application at some height h, one needs to know the validator set at that height so that one can verify the corresponding digital signatures and hashes. A naive way of determining the validator set for height h requires one to: (i) download all blocks before h, (ii) verify blocks by checking digital signatures and hashes and (iii) execute the corresponding transactions so the changes in the validator sets are reproduced. This can potentially be very slow and computationally and data intensive. In this paper we formalize the dynamic fault model imposed by Tendermint, and describe a light client protocol that allows to check the state of the blockchain application that, in realistic settings, reduces significantly the amount of data needed to be downloaded, and the number of required computationally expensive signature verification operations. In addition to mathematical proofs, we have formalized the light client protocol in TLA+, and checked safety and liveness with the APALACHE model checker.",

It is challenging to overcome the spreading of fake news problems in traditional centralized systems. However, Blockchain-- a distributed decentralized technology that ensures data provenance, authenticity, and traceability by providing a transparent, immutable, and verifiable transaction records can help in detecting and contending fake news. This paper proposes a novel hybrid model DeHiDe: Deep Learning-based Hybrid Model to Detect Fake News using Blockchain. The DeHiDe is a blockchain-based framework for legitimate news sharing by filtering out the fake news. It combines the benefit of blockchain with an intelligent deep learning model to reinforce robustness and accuracy in combating fake news's hurdle. It also compares the proposed method to existing state-of-the-art methods. The DeHiDe is expected to outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of services, features, and performance.",

In this sense, personal data have got attention, and many regulations emerged, such as GDPR in the European Union and LGPD in Brazil. This regulation model aims to protect users' data from misusage and leakage and allow users to request an explanation from companies when needed. In pandemic situations, such as the COVID-19 and Ebola outbreak, the action related to sharing health data between different organizations is/ was crucial to develop a significant movement to avoid the massive infection and decrease the number of deaths. However, the data subject, i.e., the users, should have the right to request the purpose of data use, anonymization, and data deletion. In this sense, permissioned blockchain technology emerges to empower users to get their rights providing data ownership, transparency, and security through an immutable, unified, and distributed database ruled by smart contracts. The governance model discussed in blockchain applications is usually regarding the first layer governance, i.e., public and permissioned models. However, this discussion is too superficial, and they do not cover compliance with the data regulations. Therefore, in order to organize the relationship between data owners and the stakeholders, i.e., companies and governmental entities, we developed a second layer data governance model for permissioned blockchains based on the Governance Analytical Framework principles applied in pandemic situations preserving the users' privacy and their duties. From the law perspective, we based our model on the UE GDPR in regard to data privacy concerns.",

Through the internet, the IoMT is capable of providing remote medical diagnosis and timely health services. The patients can use their smart devices to create, store and share their electronic health records (EHR) with a variety of medical personnel including medical doctors and nurses. However, unless the underlying combination within IoMT is secured, malicious users can intercept, modify and even delete the sensitive EHR data of patients. Patients also lose full control of their EHR since most health services within IoMT are constructed under a centralized platform outsourced in the cloud. Therefore, it is appealing to design a decentralized, auditable and secure EHR system that guarantees absolute access control for the patients while ensuring privacy and security. Using the features of blockchain including decentralization, auditability and immutability, we propose a secure EHR framework which is mainly maintained by the medical centers. In this framework, the patients' EHR data are encrypted and stored in the servers of medical institutions while the corresponding hash values are kept on the blockchain. We make use of security primitives to offer authentication, integrity and confidentiality of EHR data while access control and immutability is guaranteed by the blockchain technology. The security analysis and performance evaluation of the proposed framework confirms its efficiency.",

A natural requirement for MLaaS is, however, to provide highly accurate prediction services. To achieve this, current MLaaS systems integrate and combine multiple well-trained models in their services. However, in reality, there is no easy way for MLaaS providers, especially for startups, to collect well-trained models from individual developers, due to the lack of incentives. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by building a model marketplace, called as Golden Grain, to facilitate model sharing, which enforces the fair model-money swaps between individual developers and MLaaS providers. Specifically, we deploy the swapping process on the blockchain, and further introduce a blockchain-empowered model benchmarking design for transparently determining the model prices according to their authentic performances so as to incentivize the faithful contributions of well-trained models. Especially, to ease the blockchain overhead for benchmarking, our marketplace carefully offloads the heavy computation and crafts a trusted execution environment (TEE) based secure off-chain on-chain interaction protocol, ensuring both the integrity and authenticity of benchmarking. We implement a prototype of our Golden Grain on the Ethereum blockchain, and conduct extensive experiments with standard benchmark datasets to demonstrate the practically affordable performance of our design.",

In this paper we explore how Blockchains (in particular Ethereum) can be used to determine the evolving ownership of a model trained with Federated Learning. Firstly, we use the step-by-step evaluation metric to assess the relative contributivities of participants in a Federated Learning process. Next, we introduce 2CP, a framework comprising two novel protocols for Blockchained Federated Learning, which both reward contributors with shares in the final model based on their relative contributivity. The Crowdsource Protocol allows an actor to bring a model forward for training, and use their own data to evaluate the contributions made to it. Potential trainers are guaranteed a fair share of the resulting model, even in a trustless setting. The Consortium Protocol gives trainers the same guarantee even when no party owns the initial model and no evaluator is available. We conduct experiments with the MNIST dataset that reveal sound contributivity scores resulting from both Protocols by rewarding larger datasets with greater shares in the model. Our experiments also showed the necessity to pair 2CP with a robust model aggregation mechanism to discard low quality inputs coming from model poisoning attacks.",

Distinguishing trusted information from numerous sources is the key to a reliable VCS platform. This paper proposes a solution to this problem called \"RC-chain\", a reputation-based crowdsourcing framework built on a blockchain platform (Hyperledger Fabric). We first establish the blockchain-based platform to support the management of crowdsourcing trading and user-reputation evaluating activities. A reputation model, the Trust Propagation \\& Feedback Similarity (TPFS), then calculates the reputation values of participants and reveals any malicious behavior accordingly. Finally, queueing theory is used to evaluate the blockchain-based platform and optimize the system performance.

However, the centralized architecture of FL is vulnerable to the single point of failure. In addition, FL does not examine the legitimacy of local models, so even a small fraction of malicious devices can disrupt global training. To resolve these robustness issues of FL, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized FL framework, termed VBFL, by exploiting two mechanisms in a blockchained architecture. First, we introduced a novel decentralized validation mechanism such that the legitimacy of local model updates is examined by individual validators. Second, we designed a dedicated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism where stake is more frequently rewarded to honest devices, which protects the legitimate local model updates by increasing their chances of dictating the blocks appended to the blockchain. Together, these solutions promote more federation within legitimate devices, enabling robust FL. Our emulation results of the MNIST classification corroborate that with 15% of malicious devices, VBFL achieves 87% accuracy, which is 7.4x higher than Vanilla FL.",

Although existing blockchain-based cryptocurrency schemes can ensure reasonable security for transactions, they do not consider any notion of fairness. Fair exchange allows two players to exchange digital \"items\", such as digital signatures, over insecure networks fairly, so that either each player gets the other's item, or neither player does. Given that blockchain participants typically do not trust each other, enabling fairness in existing cryptocurrencies is an essential but insufficiently explored problem. In this paper, we explore the solution space for enabling the fair exchange of a cryptocurrency payment for a receipt. We identify the timeliness of an exchange as an important property especially when one of the parties involved in the exchange is resource-constrained. We introduce the notion of strong timeliness for a fair exchange protocol and propose two fair payment-for-receipt protocol instantiations that leverage functionality of the blockchain to achieve strong timeliness. We implement both and compare their security and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The surging interest in blockchain technology has revitalized the search for effective Byzantine consensus schemes. In particular, the blockchain community has been looking for ways to effectively integrate traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols into a blockchain consensus layer allowing various financial institutions to securely agree on the order of transactions. However, existing BFT protocols can only scale to tens of nodes due to their $O(n^2)$ message complexity. In this paper, we propose FastBFT, a fast and scalable BFT protocol. At the heart of FastBFT is a novel message aggregation technique that combines hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) with lightweight secret sharing primitives. Combining this technique with several other optimizations (i.e., optimistic execution, tree topology and failure detection), FastBFT achieves low latency and high throughput even for large scale networks. Via systematic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that FastBFT has better scalability and performance than previous BFT protocols.",

In choreographies, control over a process instance is shared between independent parties, and no party has full control or knowledge during process runtime. Nevertheless, it is necessary to monitor and verify process instances during runtime for purposes of documentation, accounting, or compensation. To achieve business process runtime verification, this work explores the suitability of the Bitcoin blockchain to create a novel solution for choreographies. The resulting approach is realized in a fully-functional software prototype. This software solution is evaluated in a qualitative comparison. Findings show that our blockchain-based approach enables a seamless execution monitoring and verification of choreographies, while at the same time preserving anonymity and independence of the process participants. Furthermore, the prototype is evaluated in a performance analysis.",

These requirements consist of a single set of rules that have binding legal status and should be enforced in all EU member states. In light of these requirements, we propose in this paper the use of a blockchain-based approach to support data accountability and provenance tracking. Our approach relies on the use of publicly auditable contracts deployed in a blockchain that increase the transparency with respect to the access and usage of data. We identify and discuss three different models for our approach with different granularity and scalability requirements where contracts can be used to encode data usage policies and provenance tracking information in a privacy-friendly way. From these three models we designed, implemented, and evaluated a model where contracts are deployed by data subjects for each data controller, and a model where subjects join contracts deployed by data controllers in case they accept the data handling conditions. Our implementations show in practice the feasibility and limitations of contracts for the purposes identified in this paper.",

However, they tend to have many vulnerabilities which can be exploited by an attacker. Unsupervised techniques, such as anomaly detection, can help us secure the IoT devices. However, an anomaly detection model must be trained for a long time in order to capture all benign behaviors. This approach is vulnerable to adversarial attacks since all observations are assumed to be benign while training the anomaly detection model. In this paper, we propose CIoTA, a lightweight framework that utilizes the blockchain concept to perform distributed and collaborative anomaly detection for devices with limited resources. CIoTA uses blockchain to incrementally update a trusted anomaly detection model via self-attestation and consensus among IoT devices. We evaluate CIoTA on our own distributed IoT simulation platform, which consists of 48 Raspberry Pis, to demonstrate CIoTA's ability to enhance the security of each device and the security of the network as a whole.",

Due to these properties, the Bitcoin protocol is being used as a decentralized, trusted, and secure timestamping service. Although Bitcoin participants which create new blocks cannot modify their order, they can manipulate timestamps almost undetected. This undermines the Bitcoin protocol as a reliable timestamping service. In particular, a newcomer that synchronizes the entire blockchain has a little guarantee about timestamps of all blocks. In this paper, we present a simple yet powerful mechanism that increases the reliability of Bitcoin timestamps. Our protocol can provide evidence that a block was created within a certain time range. The protocol is efficient, backward compatible, and surprisingly, currently deployed SSL/TLS servers can act as reference time sources. The protocol has many applications and can be used for detecting various attacks against the Bitcoin protocol.",

The key component of the approach is a blockchain platform that allows an interaction between agents via liability smart contracts. Reliability of a service provider is usually determined by a reputation model. However, this solution only warns future customers about an extent of trust to the service provider in case it could not execute any previous liabilities correctly. From the other hand a blockchain consensus protocol can additionally include a validation procedure that detects incorrect liability executions in order to suspend payment transactions to questionable service providers. The paper presents the validation methodology of a liability execution for agent-based service providers in a decentralized trading market, using the Model Checking method based on the mathematical model of finite state automata and Temporal Logic properties of interest. To demonstrate this concept, we implemented the methodology in the Duckietown application, moving an autonomous mobile robot to achieve a mission goal with the following behavior validation at the end of a completed scenario.",

Therefore, when problems arise -- violations of Service Level Agreements, data corruption, data leakage, security breaches -- both customers and Cloud providers face the challenge of agreeing on which party is to be held responsible.

In order to create incentives for the DER to operate below capacity, we propose a proportional-fairness control strategy in which (i) a subset of DERs decrease their own power output, sacrificing the individual revenue, and (ii) the DERs in the subset are dynamically selected based on the record of their control history. The trustworthy implementation of the scheme is carried out through a custom-designed blockchain mechanism that maintains a distributed database trusted by all DERs. In particular, the blockchain is used to stipulate and store a smart contract that enforces proportional fairness. The simulation results verify the potential of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain (BC), the technology behind the Bitcoin crypto-currency system, is considered to be both alluring and critical for ensuring enhanced security and (in some implementations, non-traceable) privacy for diverse applications in many other domains including in the Internet of Things (IoT) eco-system. Intensive research is currently being conducted in both academia and industry applying the Blockchain technology in multifarious applications. Proof-of-Work (PoW), a cryptographic puzzle, plays a vital role in ensuring BC security by maintaining a digital ledger of transactions, which is considered to be incorruptible. Furthermore, BC uses a changeable Public Key (PK) to record the users' identity, which provides an extra layer of privacy. Not only in cryptocurrency has the successful adoption of BC been implemented but also in multifaceted non-monetary systems such as in: distributed storage systems, proof-of-location, healthcare, decentralized voting and so forth. Recent research articles and projects/applications were surveyed to assess the implementation of BC for enhanced security, to identify associated challenges and to propose solutions for BC enabled enhanced security systems.",

On the one hand, we can make little assumptions about the reliability and security of the underlying Internet. On the other hand, the applications on consortium blockchains demand a system as scalable as the Bit-coin but providing much higher performance, as well as provable safety. We present a new BFT protocol, Gosig, that combines crypto-based secret leader selection and multi-round voting in the protocol layer with implementation layer optimizations such as gossip-based message propagation. In particular, Gosig guarantees safety even in a network fully controlled by adversaries, while providing provable liveness with easy-to-achieve network connectivity assumption. On a wide area testbed consisting of 140 Amazon EC2 servers spanning 14 cities on five continents, we show that Gosig can achieve over 4,000 transactions per second with less than 1 minute transaction confirmation time.",

    "abstract": "Since 2004, different research was handling the challenges in the centralized voting systems, e-voting protocols and recently the decentralized voting. So electronic voting puts forward some difficulties regarding the voter anonymity, the secure casting of the votes and to prevent the voting process from frauding. The Decentralized property of the technology called \"blockchain\" could have the solution for many of the challenges in voting research area and brings a new secure mechanism of safe and transparent voting. In this paper, a broad comparison between ongoing voting systems has studied by analyzing their structure and the drawbacks that should consider in future to improve the whole election process from keeping the privacy of the voter, casting a vote with the possibility to check if it was counted correctly to publishing the results. The result of the paper will give a new approach to extend the target of the election from small scale to large scale despite the fact of Ethereum limitation which can cast on the blockchain just five votes per minute. The primary challenge is to find an answer for this question: \"How to balance between voter privacy and transparency without breaking the important rule where the voter can proof for a specific candidate that he voted for him in a bribe situation?\".",

This would allow users to train machine learning models for a reward in a trustless manner. The smart contract will use the blockchain to automatically validate the solution, so there would be no debate about whether the solution was correct or not. Users who submit the solutions won't have counterparty risk that they won't get paid for their work. Contracts can be created easily by anyone with a dataset, even programmatically by software agents. This creates a market where parties who are good at solving machine learning problems can directly monetize their skillset, and where any organization or software agent that has a problem to solve with AI can solicit solutions from all over the world. This will incentivize the creation of better machine learning models, and make AI more accessible to companies and software agents.",

On the other hand, the constraints of energy consumption and the low computing power of the nodes require the use of algorithms of low complexity (Zhang2014) .

This significantly improves previous results, which either incurs quadratic communication complexity, or only satisfies safety in a probabilistic sense. LinBFT is based on the popular PBFT protocol, and cuts down its $O(n^4)$ complexity with three tricks, each by $O(n)$: linear view change, threshold signatures, and verifiable random functions. All three are known, i.e., the solutions are right in front of our eyes, and yet LinBFT is the first $O(n)$ solution with deterministic security guarantees. Further, LinBFT also addresses issues that are specific to permission-less, public blockchain systems, such as anonymous participants without a public-key infrastructure, proof-of-stake with slashing, rotating leader, and a dynamic participant set. In addition, LinBFT contains no proof-of-work module, reaches consensus for every block, and tolerates changing honesty of the participants for different blocks.",

In order to control the access to this data, allowing devices to verify the reliability of their own interactions with other endpoints of the network is a crucial step to ensure this required safeness. Through the implementation of a blockchain-based Public Key Infrastructure connected to the Keybase platform, it is possible to achieve a simple protocol that binds devices' public keys to their owner accounts, which are respectively supported by identity proofs. The records of this blockchain represent digital signatures performed by this Keybase users on their respective devices' public keys, claiming their ownership. Resorting to this distributed and decentralized PKI, any device is able to autonomously verify the entity in control of a certain node of the network and prevent future interactions with unverified parties.",

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based anonymous reputation system (BARS) to break the linkability between real identities and public keys to preserve privacy. The certificate and revocation transparency is implemented efficiently using two blockchains. We design a trust model to improve the trustworthiness of messages relying on the reputation of the sender based on both direct historical interactions and indirect opinions about the sender. Experiments are conducted to evaluate BARS in terms of security and performance and the results show that BARS is able to establish distributed trust management, while protecting the privacy of vehicles.",

In particular, it is difficult to certify the identification of connected devices and to prevent the illegal spoofing. It is because the conventional security technologies have advanced for mainly protecting logical network and not for physical network like the Internet-of-Things. In order to protect the Internet-of-Things with advanced security technologies, we propose a new concept (datachain layer) which is a well-designed combination of physical chip identification and blockchain.

We show that a simple monetary mechanism that consists only of one coin type can enable the achievability of the optimal centralized solution. The proposed greedy distributed algorithm relies on incentivizing the users to share their resources in one channel use, in return of credit they receive for maximizing their rate gains in future channel uses.

In this work, we present vDLT -- a service-oriented blockchain system with virtualization and decoupled management/control and execution. In vDLT, services and applications are classified into different classes according to their QoS requirements, including confirmation latency, throughput, cost, security, privacy, etc. This is a paradigm shift from the existing \"blockchain-oriented\" DLT systems to next generation \"service-oriented\" DLT systems. Different QoS requirements are fulfilled by advanced schemes inspired by the development of the traditional Internet, including classification, queuing, virtualization, resource allocation and orchestration, and hierarchical architecture. In addition, management/control and execution of smart contracts are decoupled to support QoS provisioning, improve decentralization, and facilitate evolution in vDLT. With virtualization, different virtual DLT systems with widely varying characteristics can be dynamically created and operated to accommodate different services and applications.",

In order to cope with the problem, several solutions have been proposed to reduce the storage burden. However, existing solutions either achieve a limited storage reduction (e.g., simple payment verification), or rely on some strong security assumption (e.g., the use of trusted server).

Our proposed system also enables the taxpayers to print their electronic documents without losing the paid electronic-based stamps.",

In this work, we introduce a complete probabilistic model of the Bitcoin Blockchain. We first formulate a set of conditional dependencies induced by the Bitcoin protocol at the block level and derive a corresponding fully observed graphical model of a Bitcoin block. We then extend the model to include hidden entity attributes such as the functional category of the associated logical agent and derive asymptotic bounds on the privacy properties implied by this model. At the network level, we show evidence of complex transaction-to-transaction behavior and present a relevant discriminative model of the agent categories. Performance of both the block-based graphical model and the network-level discriminative model is evaluated on a subset of the public Bitcoin Blockchain.",

This framework utilizes Bitcoin Lightning-Network-like payment channels with low processing and storage requirements. This protocol enables IoT devices to open and maintain payment channels with traditional Bitcoin nodes without a view of the blockchain. Unlike existing solutions, it does not require a trusted third party to interact with the blockchain nor does it burden the peer-to-peer network in the way SPV clients do. The contribution of this paper includes a secure and crypto-economically fair protocol for bidirectional Bitcoin payment channels. In addition, we demonstrate the security and fairness of the protocol by formulating it as a game in which the equilibrium is reached when all players follow the protocol.",

However, insider attacks -- where someone with an intimate knowledge of the system and administrative privileges tampers with the data -- pose a unique challenge. Measures like append only logging prove to be insufficient because an attacker with administrative privileges can alter logs and login records to eliminate the trace of attack, thus making insider attacks hard to detect. In this paper, we propose Verity -- first of a kind system to the best of our knowledge. Verity serves as a dataless framework by which any blockchain network can be used to store fixed-length metadata about tuples from any SQL database, without complete migration of the database. Verity uses a formalism for parsing SQL queries and query results to check the respective tuples' integrity using blockchains to detect insider attacks. We have implemented our technique using Hyperledger Fabric, Composer REST API, and SQLite database. Using TPC-H data and SQL queries of varying complexity and types, our experiments demonstrate that any overhead of integrity checking remains constant per tuple in a query's results, and scales linearly.",

In a nutshell, centralized networking has had issues with flexibility, efficiency, availability, and security. Therefore, this paper aims to tackle these problems by introducing an ongoing project to a decentralized network architecture for cloud manufacturing which is based on the blockchain technology.

Most of the existing IoT infrastructures are centralized, in which the presence of a cloud server is mandatory. However, centralized frameworks suffer from the issues of unscalability and single-point-of-failure. Consequently, decentralized IoT has been proposed by taking advantage of the emerging technology of Blockchain. Voting systems are widely adopted in IoT, such as a leader election in wireless sensor networks. Self-tallying voting systems are alternatives to traditional centralized voting systems in decentralized IoT since the traditional ones are not suitable for such scenarios. Unfortunately, self-tallying voting systems inherently suffer from fairness issues, such as adaptive and abortive issues caused by malicious voters. In this paper, we introduce a framework of self-tallying systems in decentralized IoT based on Blockchain. We propose a concrete construction and prove the proposed system satisfies all the security requirements including fairness, dispute-freeness and maximal ballot secrecy. The implementations on mobile phones demonstrate the practicability of our system.",

In addition, the insightful knowledge of whether and how a traditional application can be transformed to a dapp is yet missing. To bridge the knowledge gap, this paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on an extensive dataset of 734 dapps that are collected from three popular open dapp marketplaces, i.e., ethereum, state of the dapp, and DAppRadar. We analyze the popularity of dapps, and summarize the patterns of how smart contracts are organized in a dapp. Based on the findings, we draw some implications to help dapp developers and users better understand and deploy dapps.",

    "abstract": "We put forward the idea that classical blockchains and smart contracts are potentially useful primitives not only for classical cryptography, but for quantum cryptography as well. Abstractly, a smart contract is a functionality that allows parties to deposit funds, and release them upon fulfillment of algorithmically checkable conditions, and can thus be employed as a formal tool to enforce monetary incentives. In this work, we give the first example of the use of smart contracts in a quantum setting. We describe a simple hybrid classical-quantum payment system whose main ingredients are a classical blockchain capable of handling stateful smart contracts, and quantum lightning, a strengthening of public-key quantum money introduced by Zhandry [Eurocrypt 2019]. Our hybrid payment system uses quantum states as banknotes and a classical blockchain to settle disputes and to keep track of the valid serial numbers. It has several desirable properties: it is decentralized, requiring no trust in any single entity; payments are as quick as quantum communication, regardless of the total number of users; when a quantum banknote is damaged or lost, the rightful owner can recover the lost value.",

A blockchain is a series of blocks, each block is linked to its previous blocks. Every block has the cryptographic hash code, previous block hash, and its data. The transactions in BC are the basic units that are used to transfer data between IoT nodes. The IoT nodes are different kind of physical but smart devices with embedded sensors, actuators, programs and able to communicate with other IoT nodes. The role of BC in IoT is to provide a procedure to process secured records of data through IoT nodes. BC is a secured technology that can be used publicly and openly. IoT requires this kind of technology to allow secure communication among IoT nodes in heterogeneous environment. The transactions in BC could be traced and explored through anyone who are authenticated to communicate within the IoT. The BC in IoT may help to improve the communication security.

We formalize the recently proposed proof-of-authority consensus algorithms that are Byzantine fault tolerant by describing the Aura and Clique protocols present in the two mainstream implementations of Ethereum. We then introduce the Cloning Attack and show how to apply it to double spend in each of these protocols with a single malicious node. Our results show that the Cloning Attack against Aura is always successful while the same attack against Clique is about twice as fast and succeeds in most cases.",

Based on the framework, we introduce Lisk-BFT, a Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm for the Lisk blockchain. Lisk-BFT integrates with the existing block proposal, requires only two additional integers in block headers and no additional messages. The protocol is simple and provides safety in the case of static proposers if less than 1/3 of the block proposers are Byzantine. For the case of dynamically changing proposers, we proof the safety of the protocol assuming a bound on the number of Byzantine proposers and the number of honest proposers that can change at one time. We further show the liveness of the Lisk-BFT protocol for less than 1/3 crashing block proposers.",

Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) guarantee the provenance, authenticity and traceability of data by providing a transparent, immutable and verifiable record of transactions while creating a peer-to-peer secure platform for storing and exchanging information.

In a decentralized blockchain, the state of smart contracts is collaboratively maintained by a peer-to-peer network of mutually untrusted nodes, which collect from users a set of transactions (representing the required actions on contracts), and execute them in some order. Once this sequence of transactions is appended to the blockchain, the other nodes validate it, re-executing the transactions in the same order. The serial execution of transactions does not take advantage of the multi-core architecture of modern processors, so contributing to limit the throughput. In this paper we propose a true concurrent model of smart contract execution. Based on this, we show how static analysis of smart contracts can be exploited to parallelize the execution of transactions.",

Being built over the Ethereum blockchain, LikeStarter is structured as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), that fosters crowdfunding without the intervention of any central authority, and recognizes the active role of donors, enabling them to support artists or projects, while making profits.",

Our service harnesses the digital personhood (DP); the longitudinal and multi-modal signals created through users' lifelong digital interactions, as a basis for evidencing the provenance of identity. We describe how users may exchange trust evidence derived from their DP, in a granular and privacy-preserving manner, with other users in order to demonstrate coherence and longevity in their behaviour online. This is enabled through a novel secure infrastructure combining hybrid on- and off-chain storage combined with deep learning for DP analytics and visualization. We show how our tools enable users to make more effective decisions on whether to trust unknown third parties online, and also to spot behavioural deviations in their own social media footprints indicative of account hijacking.",

Securing BGP has been a long-term objective of several research and industrial efforts during the last decades, that have culminated in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) for the cryptographic verification of prefix-to-AS assignments. However, there is still no widely adopted solution for securing IP prefixes and the (AS-)paths leading to them; approaches such as BGPsec have seen minuscule deployment. In this work, we design and implement a Blockchain-based system that (i) can be used to validate both of these resource types, (ii) can work passively and does not require any changes in the inter-domain routing system (BGP, RPKI), and (iii) can be combined with currently available systems for the detection and mitigation of routing attacks. We present early results and insights w.r.t. scalability.",

Unlike other wallets, it achieves all these properties while being secure against privilege escalation. We formalize the security model of hierarchical deterministic wallets and prove that an attacker compromising an arbitrary number of users within an Arcula wallet cannot escalate his privileges and compromise users higher in the access hierarchy. Our design works out-of-the-box with any blockchain that enables the verification of signatures on arbitrary messages. We evaluate its usage in a real-world scenario on the Bitcoin Cash network.",

Our protocol allows the wasted energy to be used for finding approximate solutions to problems submitted by any nodes~(called clients). Our protocol works in a similar way to proof-of-work, and it makes nodes evaluate a large number of solution candidates to add a new block to the chain. A client provides a search program that implements any search algorithm that finds a good solution by evaluating a large number of solution candidates. The node that finds the best approximate solution is rewarded by the client. Our analysis shows that the probability of a fork and the variance in the block time with our protocol are lower than those in proof-of-work.",

Hence, it is important to ensure the correctness of smart contracts before deploying them. This paper proposes a systematic framework to mutation testing for smart contracts on Ethereum, which is currently the most popular open blockchain for deploying and running smart contracts. Fifteen novel mutation operators have been designed for Ethereum Smart Contracts (ESC), in terms of keyword, global variable/function, variable unit, and error handling. An empirical study on 26 smart contracts in four Ethereum DApps has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of mutation testing. The experimental results show that our approach can outperform the coverage-based approach on defect detection rate (96.01% vs. 55.68%). The ESC mutation operators are effective to reveal real defects and we found 117 out of 729 real bug reports are related to our operators. These show the great potential of using mutation testing for quality assurance of ESC.",

The protocol relies on bulletproofs, Truebit, and parametrized tokens to efficiently and trustlessly relay events from the \"true\" Dogecoin blockchain into Ethereum. The present construction not only enables cross-platform exchange but also allows Ethereum smart contracts to trustlessly access Dogecoin.

Obsidian is a novel programming language with a type system that enables static detection of bugs that are common in smart contracts today. Obsidian is based on a core calculus, Silica, for which we proved type soundness. Obsidian uses typestate to detect improper state manipulation and uses linear types to detect abuse of assets. We describe two case studies that evaluate Obsidian's applicability to the domains of parametric insurance and supply chain management, finding that Obsidian's type system facilitates reasoning about high-level states and ownership of resources. We compared our Obsidian implementation to a Solidity implementation, observing that the Solidity implementation requires much boilerplate checking and tracking of state, whereas Obsidian does this work statically.",

In this paper, we introduce BAFFLE, an aggregator free, blockchain driven, FL environment that is inherently decentralized. BAFFLE leverages Smart Contracts (SC) to coordinate the round delineation, model aggregation and update tasks in FL. BAFFLE boosts computational performance by decomposing the global parameter space into distinct chunks followed by a score and bid strategy. In order to characterize the performance of BAFFLE, we conduct experiments on a private Ethereum network and use the centralized and aggregator driven methods as our benchmark. We show that BAFFLE significantly reduces the gas costs for FL on the blockchain as compared to a direct adaptation of the aggregator based method. Our results also show that BAFFLE achieves high scalability and computational efficiency while delivering similar accuracy as the benchmark methods.",

Herein, the design of signature material combining cryptographic hash function and DNA steganography is proposed. The encrypting materials are used to construct a series of time-stamped records (blockchain) associated with published hash values, while each DNA-encrypted block is associated with a set of DNA keys. The decrypted DNA information, as digital keys, can be validated through a hash function to compare with the published hash values. The blocks can also be cross-referenced among different related signatures. While both digital cryptography and DNA steganography can have large key size, automated brutal force search is far more labor intensive and expensive for DNA steganography with wet lab experiments, as compared to its digital counterpart. Moreover, the time-stamped blockchain structure permits the incorporation of new cryptographic functions and DNA steganographies over time, thus can evolve over time without losing the continuous history line.",

To answer these questions, we embark on an axiomatic theory of incentives in proof-of-work blockchains at the time scale of a single block. We consider desirable properties of allocation rules including: symmetry; budget balance (weak or strong); sybil-proofness; and various grades of collusion-proofness. We show that Bitcoin's proportional allocation rule is the unique allocation rule satisfying a certain system of properties, but this does not hold for slightly weaker sets of properties, or when the miners are not risk-neutral. We also point out that a rich class of allocation rules can be approximately implemented in a proof-of-work blockchain.",

In this paper, a method to attack Bitcoin anonymity is presented, leveraging a novel cascading machine learning approach that requires only a few features directly extracted from Bitcoin blockchain data. Cascading, used to enrich entities information with data from previous classifications, led to considerably improved multi-class classification performance with excellent values of Precision close to 1.0 for each considered class. Final models were implemented and compared using different machine learning models and showed significantly higher accuracy compared to their baseline implementation.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a holistic analysis of the project encompassing several aspects of its implementation and the issues it raises. We address a set of questions that are part of the cryptocurrency environment and blockchain technology that support the Libra project. We describe the governance of the project based on two levels, one for the Association and the other for the Libra Blockchain. We identify the main risks considering at the same time political, financial, economic, technological and ethical risks. We emphasize the difficulty to regulate such a project as it will depend on several countries whose legislations are very different. Finally, the future of this kind of projects is discussed through the emergence of Central Bank Digital Currencies.",

This is possible only if the distributed ledger creates succinct proofs of the valid state updates at the end of each epoch. Our model builds upon and extends the Bitcoin backbone protocol by defining consistency and scalability. Consistency encompasses the need for atomic execution of cross-shard transactions to preserve safety, whereas scalability encapsulates the speedup a sharded system can gain in comparison to a non-sharded system. In order to show the power of our framework, we analyze the most prominent sharded blockchains and either prove their correctness (OmniLedger, RapidChain) under our model or pinpoint where they fail to balance the consistency and scalability requirements (Elastico, Monoxide).",

The result is a blockchain which redirects some of the computational resources invested in hash-based mining towards scientific computation, effectively reducing the amount of energy `wasted' on mining. DIPS builds the solving incentive directly in the proof-of-work by providing a reduction in block hashing difficulty when optimization improvements are found. A key advantage of this scheme is that decentralization is preserved and no additional protocol layers are required on top of the standard blockchain. We study two incentivization schemes and provide simulation results showing that DIPS is able to reduce the amount of hash-power used in the network while generating solutions to optimization problems.",

Our formalization allows for inter-contract communication and generalizes existing work by allowing modelling of both depth-first execution blockchains (like Ethereum) and breadth-first execution blockchains (like Tezos). We represent smart contracts programs in Coq's functional language Gallina, enabling easier reasoning about functional correctness of concrete contracts than other approaches. In particular we develop a Congress contract in this style. This contract -- a simplified version of the infamous DAO -- is interesting because of its very dynamic communication pattern with other contracts. We give a high-level partial specification of the Congress's behavior, related to reentrancy, and prove that the Congress satisfies it for all possible smart contract execution orders.",

    "abstract": "A problem of developing the consensus protocols in public blockchain systems which spend a combination of energy and space resources is addressed. A technique is proposed that provides a flexibility for selection of the energy and space resources which should be spent by a player participating in the consensus procedure. The technique originates from the cryptographic time-memory-data trade-off approaches for cryptanalysis. The proposed technique avoids the limitations of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of Space (PoS) which require spending of only energy and space, respectively. Also, it provides a flexibility for adjusting the resources spending to the system budget. The proposed consensus technique is based on a puzzle where the problem of inverting one-way function is solved employing a dedicated Time-Memory-Data Trade-Off (TMD-TO) paradigm. The algorithms of the consensus protocol are proposed which employ certain unconstrained and constrained TMD-TO based inversions. Security of the proposed technique is considered based on the probability that the honest pool of nodes generate a longer extension of the blockchain before its update, and a condition on the employed parameters in order to achieve desired security have been derived. Implementation complexity of the proposed consensus protocol is discussed and compared with the complexities when PoW and PoS are employed.",

However, once the data in the blockchain is written, it cannot be modified. Ethereum smart contract is stored in the block chain, which makes the smart contract can no longer repair the code problems such as re-entrancy vulnerabilities or integer overflow problems. Currently, there still lacks of an efficient and effective approach for detecting these problems in Solidity. In this paper, we first classify all the possible problems in Solidity, then propose a smart contract problem detection approach for Solidity, namely SolidityCheck. The approach uses regular expressions to define the characteristics of problematic statements and uses regular matching and program instrumentation to prevent or detect problems. Finally, a large number of experiments is performed to show that SolidityCheck is superior to existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts on a blockchain behave precisely as specified by their code. A vulnerability in this code can lead to unexpected behaviour, which is hard to fix because a blockchain does not allow to change smart contract code after its deployment. Such vulnerabilities have led to several incidents. In the aftermath of such an event, a hard-fork between Ethereum and Ethereum classic was the result. This thesis proposes to develop a new smart contract programming language with the primary focus on safety, auditability, and the intention to prevent as many of the known categories of vulnerabilities by design as possible. The programming language's code is validated during deployment and afterwards isolated from other smart contracts running on the same blockchain to enforce compile-time guarantees during runtime. The designed programming language does evaluate new concepts and paradigms rarely used in non-smart contract environments for their potential benefit in a smart contract environment.",

However, many characteristics of B-RAN remain unclear and hard to characterize. In this study, we develop an analytical framework to model B-RAN and provide some basic fundamental analysis. Starting from block generation, we establish a queuing model based on a time-homogeneous Markov chain. From the queuing model, we evaluate the performance of B-RAN with respect to latency and security considerations. By connecting latency and security, we uncover a more comprehensive picture of the achievable performance of B-RAN.

In order to meet the requirements of data query and provide flexible query functions for real applications built on Fabric, this paper proposed a ledger data query platform called Ledgerdata Refiner. With ledger data analysis middleware, we provide sufficient interfaces for users to retrieve block or transaction efficiently. It is also able to track historical operations for any specific state. In addition, schemas of ledger state have been analyzed and clustered, which enable users to perform rich queries against ledger data.

Cerberus also improves significantly upon other blockchain-based solutions in the research literature: it adheres closely to the existing credential verification ecosystem, it addresses a threat model informed by real-world fraud scenarios. Moreover, Cerberus uses on-chain smart contracts for credential revocation, and it does not entail students or employers to manage digital identities or cryptographic credentials to use the system. We prototype our solution and describe our attempt to design an online verification service with a rich feature set, including data privacy, transcript verification, and selective disclosure of data.

Here, we develop a blockchain based Trust and Reputation System (TRS) for IoT access control, which progressively evaluates and calculates the trust and reputation score of each participating node to achieve a self-adaptive and trustworthy access control system. Trust and reputation are explicitly incorporated in the attribute-based access control policy, so that different nodes can be assigned to different access right levels, resulting in dynamic access control policies.

IPFS is a file storage protocol allowing files to be stored on decentralized systems. In the HTTP client-server protocol, files are downloaded from a single source. With files stored on a decentralized network, IPFS allows packet retrieval from multiple sources, simultaneously saving considerable bandwidth. IPFS uses a content-addressed block storage model with content-addressed hyperlinks. Large amounts of data is addressable with IPFS with the immutable and permanent IPFS links with meta-data stored as Blockchain transactions. This timestamps and secures the data, instead of having to put it on the chain itself. Our paper proposes a model that uses the decentralized file storage system of IPFS, and the integrity preservation properties of the Blockchain, to store and distribute data on the Web.",

    "abstract": "Proof of work (PoW), the most popular consensus mechanism for Blockchain, requires ridiculously large amounts of energy but without any useful outcome beyond determining accounting rights among miners. To tackle the drawback of PoW, we propose a novel energy-recycling consensus algorithm, namely proof of federated learning (PoFL), where the energy originally wasted to solve difficult but meaningless puzzles in PoW is reinvested to federated learning. Federated learning and pooled-ming, a trend of PoW, have a natural fit in terms of organization structure. However, the separation between the data usufruct and ownership in Blockchain lead to data privacy leakage in model training and verification, deviating from the original intention of federal learning. To address the challenge, a reverse game-based data trading mechanism and a privacy-preserving model verification mechanism are proposed. The former can guard against training data leakage while the latter verifies the accuracy of a trained model with privacy preservation of the task requester's test data as well as the pool's submitted model. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work to employ federal learning as the proof of work for Blockchain. Extensive simulations based on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Securing the traceability of products in the supply chain is an urgent issue. Recently, supply chain systems that use public blockchain (PBC) have been proposed. In these systems, PBC is used as a common database shared between supply chain parties to secure the integrity and reliability of distribution information such as ownership transfer records. Thus, these systems secure a high level of traceability in the supply chain. However, the distribution information, which can be private information, is made public since the information recorded in PBC can be read by anyone. In this paper, we propose a method for preserving privacy while securing traceability in a supply chain system using PBC. The proposed method preserves privacy by concealing the distribution information via encryption. In addition, the proposed method ensures distribution among legitimate supply chain parties while concealing their blockchain address by using a zero-knowledge proof to prove their authenticity. We implement the proposed method on Ethereum smart contracts and evaluate cost performance based on transaction fees. The results show that the fee per party is at most 2.6 USD.",

However, there is a lack of systematic architecture designs for blockchain-based SSI systems to support methodical development. An aspect of such gap is demonstrated in current solutions, which are considered coarse grained and may increase data security risks. In this paper, we first identify the lifecycles of three major SSI objects (i.e., key, identifier, and credential) and present fine-grained design patterns critical for application development. These patterns are associated with particular state transitions, providing a systematic view of system interactions and serving as a guidance for effective use of these patterns. Further, we present an SSI platform architecture, which advocates the notion of Design-Pattern-as-a-Service. Each design pattern serves as an API by wrapping the respective pattern code to ease application development and improve scalability and security. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on feasibility and scalability.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by Bitcoin, many different kinds of cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technology have turned up on the market. Due to the special structure of the blockchain, it has been deemed impossible to directly trade between traditional currencies and cryptocurrencies or between different types of cryptocurrencies. Generally, trading between different currencies is conducted through a centralized third-party platform. However, it has the problem of a single point of failure, which is vulnerable to attacks and thus affects the security of the transactions. In this paper, we propose a distributed cryptocurrency trading scheme to solve the problem of centralized exchanges, which can achieve trading between different types of cryptocurrencies. Our scheme is implemented with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and deployed on the Ethereum test network. We not only implement transactions between individual users, but also allow transactions between multiple users. The experimental result proves that the cost of our scheme is acceptable.",

Model-driven engineering (MDE) helps to reduce those risks, by combining proven code snippets as per the model specification, which is easier to understand than source code. Therefore, in this paper, we present an approach for integrated MDE across business processes and asset management (e.g. for settlement). Our approach includes methods for fungible/non-fungible asset registration, escrow for conditional payment, and asset swap. The proposed MDE approach is implemented in a smart contract generation tool called Lorikeet, and evaluated in terms of feasibility, functional correctness, and cost effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Distributed ledger systems (i.e., blockchains) have received a lot of attention recently. They promise to enable mutually untrusted participants to execute transactions, while providing the immutability of the transaction history and censorship resistance. Although decentralized ledgers may become a disruptive innovation, as of today, they suffer from scalability, privacy, or governance issues. Therefore, they are inapplicable for many important use cases, where interestingly, centralized ledger systems quietly gain adoption and find new use cases. Unfortunately, centralized ledgers have also several drawbacks, like a lack of efficient verifiability or a higher risk of censorship and equivocation. In this paper, we present Aquareum, a novel framework for centralized ledgers removing their main limitations. By combining a trusted execution environment with a public blockchain platform, Aquareum provides publicly verifiable, non-equivocating, censorship-evident, private, and high-performance ledgers. Aquareum ledgers are integrated with a Turing-complete virtual machine, allowing arbitrary transaction processing logics, including tokens or client-specified smart contracts. Aquareum is fully implemented and deployment-ready, even with currently existing technologies.",

However, due to inadequate testing, DApps are easily exposed to serious vulnerabilities. We find three main challenges for DApp testing, i.e., the inherent complexity of DApp, inconvenient pre-state setting, and not-so-readable logs. In this paper, we propose a testing framework named Kaya to bridge these gaps. Kaya has three main functions. Firstly, Kaya proposes DApp behavior description language (DBDL) to make writing test cases easier. Test cases written in DBDL can also be automatically executed by Kaya. Secondly, Kaya supports a flexible and convenient way for test engineers to set the blockchain pre-states easily. Thirdly, Kaya transforms incomprehensible addresses into readable variables for easy comprehension. With these functions, Kaya can help test engineers test DApps more easily. Besides, to fit the various application environments, we provide two ways for test engineers to use Kaya, i.e., UI and command-line. Our experimental case demonstrates the potential of Kaya in helping test engineers to test DApps more easily.",

The proposed architecture realizes this goal via the integration of existing blockchain frameworks (Hyperledger Fabric, Indy, Aries) with an off-grid network device and a distributed file system.

    "abstract": "Due to their rapid growth and deployment, the Internet of things (IoT) have become a central aspect of our daily lives. Unfortunately, IoT devices tend to have many vulnerabilities which can be exploited by an attacker. Unsupervised techniques, such as anomaly detection, can be used to secure these devices in a plug-and-protect manner. However, anomaly detection models must be trained for a long time in order to capture all benign behaviors. Furthermore, the anomaly detection model is vulnerable to adversarial attacks since, during the training phase, all observations are assumed to be benign. In this paper, we propose (1) a novel approach for anomaly detection and (2) a lightweight framework that utilizes the blockchain to ensemble an anomaly detection model in a distributed environment. Blockchain framework incrementally updates a trusted anomaly detection model via self-attestation and consensus among the IoT devices. We evaluate our method on a distributed IoT simulation platform, which consists of 48 Raspberry Pis. The simulation demonstrates how the approach can enhance the security of each device and the security of the network as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Classic Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols forfeit liveness in the face of asynchrony in order to preserve safety, whereas most deployed blockchain protocols forfeit safety in order to remain live. In this work, we achieve the best of both worlds by proposing a novel abstractions called the finality gadget. A finality gadget allows for transactions to always optimistically commit but informs the clients that these transactions might be unsafe. As a result, a blockchain can execute transactions optimistically and only commit them after they have been sufficiently and provably audited. In this work, we formally model the finality gadget abstraction, prove that it is impossible to solve it deterministically in full asynchrony (even though it is stronger than consensus) and provide a partially synchronous protocol which is currently securing a major blockchain. This way we show that the protocol designer can decouple safety and liveness in order to speed up recovery from failures. We believe that there can be other types of finality gadgets that provide weaker safety (e.g., probabilistic) in order to gain more efficiency and this can depend on the probability that the network is not in synchrony.",

Applications of EVR include blockchain-based lotteries and gambling. An EVR source guarantees (i) secrecy, assuring that the random bits are kept secret until some predefined condition indicates that they are safe to reveal (e.g., the lottery's ticket sale closes), and (ii) robustness, guaranteeing that the random bits are published once the condition holds. We formalize the EVR problem and solve it on top of an Ethereum-like blockchain abstraction, which supports smart contracts and a transferable native coin. Randomness is generated via a distributed open commit-reveal scheme by game-theoretic agents who strive to maximize their coin holdings. Note that in an economic setting, such agents might profit from breaking secrecy or robustness, and may engage in side agreements (via smart contracts) to this end. Our solution creates an incentive structure that counters such attacks. We prove that following the protocol gives rise to a stable state, called Coalition-Proof Nash Equilibrium, from which no coalition comprised of a subset of the players can agree to deviate. In this stable state, robustness and secrecy are satisfied. Finally, we implement our EVR source over Ethereum.",

In addition to the `usual' attacks -- a subset of the validators trying to prevent disagreement -- there is now the possibility of financial fraud, which can abuse properties not normally considered critical in consensus protocols. We investigate the issues of attackers manipulating or exploiting the order in which transactions are scheduled in the blockchain. More concretely, we look into relative order fairness, i.e., ways we can assure that the relative order of transactions is fair. We show that one of the more intuitive definitions of fairness is impossible to achieve. We then present Wendy, a group of low overhead protocols that can implement different concepts of fairness. Wendy acts as an additional widget for an existing blockchain, and is largely agnostic to the underlying blockchain and its security assumptions. Furthermore, it is possible to apply a the protocol only for a subset of the transactions, and thus run several independent fair markets on the same chain.",

    "abstract": "Although the iterative double auction has been widely used in many different applications, one of the major problems in its current implementations is that they rely on a trusted third party to handle the auction process. This imposes the risk of single point of failures, monopoly, and bribery. In this paper, we aim to tackle this problem by proposing a novel decentralized and trustless framework for iterative double auction based on blockchain. Our design adopts the smart contract and state channel technologies to enable a double auction process among parties that do not need to trust each other, while minimizing the blockchain transactions. In specific, we propose an extension to the original concept of state channels that can support multiparty computation. Then we provide a formal development of the proposed framework and prove the security of our design against adversaries. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept implementation of our framework using Elixir and Solidity, on which we conduct various experiments to demonstrate its feasibility and practicality.",

    "abstract": "Since 2016, sharding has become an auspicious solution to tackle the scalability issue in legacy blockchain systems. Despite its potential to strongly boost the blockchain throughput, sharding comes with its own security issues. To ease the process of deciding which shard to place transactions, existing sharding protocols use a hash-based transaction sharding in which the hash value of a transaction determines its output shard. Unfortunately, we show that this mechanism opens up a loophole that could be exploited to conduct a single-shard flooding attack, a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, to overwhelm a single shard that ends up reducing the performance of the system as a whole. To counter the single-shard flooding attack, we propose a countermeasure that essentially eliminates the loophole by rejecting the use of hash-based transaction sharding. The countermeasure leverages the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to let blockchain's validators securely execute a transaction sharding algorithm with a negligible overhead. We provide a formal specification for the countermeasure and analyze its security properties in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. Finally, a proof-of-concept is developed to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of our solution.",

By utilizing the ElGamal encryption, the server learns nearly nothing about the private data or the statistical result. The correctness of aggregate statistics can be publicly verified by using a new efficient and verifiable computation approach. Moreover, the fairness of incentive is guaranteed based on the public blockchain in the presence of greedy service provider, customers, and mobile users, who may launch payment-escaping, payment-reduction, free-riding, double-reporting, and Sybil attacks to corrupt reward distribution. Finally, FairCrowd is proved to achieve verifiable aggregate statistics with privacy preservation for mobile users.

To achieve that, we deconstruct the Tangle-based projects (e.g. IOTA) and abstract the main components to rebuild a simple but flexible network for the simulation. Then, we informally define three smallest actions to build up the attack strategies layer by layer. Based on that, we provide analyses to evaluate different types of attacks.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a pricing mechanism that aligns incentives of agents who exchange resources on a decentralized ledger with the goal of maximizing transaction throughput. Subdividing a blockchain ledger into shards promises to greatly increase transaction throughput with minimal loss of security. However, the organization and type of the transactions also affects the ledger's efficiency, which is increased by wallet agents transacting in a single shard whenever possible while collectively distributing their transactions uniformly across the available shards. Since there is no central authority to enforce these properties, the only means of achieving them is to design the system such that it is in agents' interest to act in a way that benefits overall throughput. We show that our proposed pricing policy does exactly this by inducing a potential game for the agents, where the potential function relates directly to ledger throughput. Simulations demonstrate that this policy leads to near-optimal throughput under a variety of conditions.",

Nevertheless, an autonomous (selfish) node in an ad-hoc network has two disincentives for forwarding packets for others: energy expenditure and possible delays for its own data. This paper introduces Price-based Path-specified Transport Protocol (PPT) for NDN, using blockchain as a payment platform to support money transfers between autonomous nodes thus to incentivise packet forwarding. In PPTP, routers advertise their expected prices for packet forwarding and consumers estimate the costs and select the appropriate paths for content downloading. PPTP is still an on-going project therefore this paper will present the design principle and planed functions, and show how PPTP are related to other existing blockchain-based networking solutions.",

In this work we formalize, analytically exposit and empirically evaluate an augmented variant of front-running: sandwich attacks, which involve front- and back-running victim transactions on a blockchain-based DEX. We quantify the probability of an adversarial trader being able to undertake the attack, based on the relative positioning of a transaction within a blockchain block. We find that a single adversarial trader can earn a daily revenue of over several thousand USD when performing sandwich attacks on one particular DEX -- Uniswap, an exchange with over 5M USD daily trading volume by June 2020. In addition to a single-adversary game, we simulate the outcome of sandwich attacks under multiple competing adversaries, to account for the real-world trading environment.",

In particular, work per node scales down proportionally with the number of participants (up to a log factor), resulting in computation, communication, and storage requirements that are sublinear in block size.

While advanced ICS attacks use sequential phases to launch their final attacks, existing anomaly detection methods can only monitor a single source of data. Therefore, analysis of multiple security data can provide comprehensive and system-wide anomaly detection in industrial networks. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection framework for ICSs that consists of two stages: i) blockchain-based log management where the logs of ICS devices are collected in a secure and distributed manner, and ii) multi-source anomaly detection where the blockchain logs are analysed using multi-source deep learning which in turn provides a system wide anomaly detection method. We validated our framework using two ICS datasets: a factory automation dataset and a Secure Water Treatment (SWAT) dataset. These datasets contain physical and network level normal and abnormal traffic. The performance of our new framework is compared with single-source machine learning methods. The precision of our framework is 95% which is comparable with single-source anomaly detectors.",

    "abstract": "To mitigate the scalability problem of decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the payment channel, which allows two parties to perform secure coin transfers without involving the blockchain, has been proposed. The payment channel increases the transaction throughput of two parties to a level that is only limited by their network bandwidth. Recent proposals focus on extending the two-party payment channel to the N-party payment hub. Unfortunately, none of them can achieve efficiency, flexibility in the absence of a trusted third-party. In this paper, we propose Garou, a secure N-party payment hub that allows multiple parties to perform secure off-chain coin transfers. Except in the case of disputes, participants within the payment hub can make concurrent and direct coin transfers with each other without the involvement of the blockchain or any third-party intermediaries. This allows Garou to achieve both high-performance and flexibility. Garou also guarantees that an honest party always maintains its balance security against strong adversarial capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of the Garou protocol, we develop a proof of concept prototype for the Ethereum network. Our evaluation results show that the maximum transaction throughput of Garou is 20 times higher than that of state-of-art payment hubs.",

However, they are not safe under network partitions, i.e., they do not achieve finality. On the other hand, there are many byzantine fault tolerant protocols that achieve finality, but not adaptivity. Indeed, the CAP theorem in the context of blockchains asserts that no protocol can simultaneously offer both adaptivity and finality. We propose a new and simple blockchain protocol, the checkpointed longest chain, that offers a single protocol along with two distinct confirmation rules: one that guarantees finality, and another that is adaptive, thus letting clients make a local choice between adaptivity and finality. Our solution builds on and sheds insight on the design of finality gadgets, which have become popular methods for achieving deterministic finality in proof-of-work protocols. Furthermore, like most deployed blockchains, our proposed solution allows for coupled validity, i.e., the finalized blocks lie on a single chain, and therefore, nodes can attest to the validity of transactions while proposing blocks.",

In today's digital era, we can find ML algorithms being applied in the areas of healthcare, IoT, engineering, finance and so on. However, all these algorithms need to be trained in order to predict/solve a particular problem. There is high possibility of tampering the training datasets and produce biased results. Hence, in this article, we have proposed blockchain based solution to secure the datasets generated from IoT devices for E-Health applications. The proposed blockchain based solution uses using private cloud to tackle the aforementioned issue. For evaluation, we have developed a system that can be used by dataset owners to secure their data.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain (BC), a by-product of Bitcoin cryptocurrency, has gained immense and wide scale popularity for its applicability in various diverse domains - especially in multifaceted non-monetary systems. By adopting cryptographic techniques such as hashing and asymmetric encryption - along with distributed consensus approach, a Blockchain based distributed ledger not only becomes highly secure but also immutable and thus eliminates the need for any third-party intermediators. On the contrary, innumerable IoT (Internet of Things) devices are increasingly being added to the network. This phenomenon poses higher risk in terms of security and privacy. It is thus extremely important to address the security aspects of the growing IoT ecosystem. This paper explores the applicability of BC for ensuring enhanced security and privacy in the IoT ecosystem. Recent research articles and projects or applications were surveyed to assess the implementation of BC for IoT Security and identify associated challenges and propose solutions for BC enabled enhanced security for the IoT ecosystem.",

The high degree of fragmentation and the reliance on third-party financial institutions has pushed the physical and financial supply chains apart. The paper demonstrates how blockchain-based crypto assets (crypto currencies and crypto tokens) can address this limitation when used for conditioning the flow of funds based on the flow of products. The paper contrasts the integration between cash and product flows in supply chains that rely on fiat currencies and crypto assets for their payment settlement. Two facets of crypto asset-enabled integration, atomicity and granularity, are further introduced. The thesis is validated in the context of construction progress payments. The as-built data captured by unmanned aerial and ground vehicles was passed to an autonomous smart contract-based method that utilizes crypto-currencies and crypto tokens for payment settlement; the resulting payment datasets, written to the Ethereum blockchain, were analyzed in terms of their integration of product and cash flow. The work is concluded with a discussion of findings and their implications for the industry.",

We provide a general model and a solution for decentralized and dynamic PKI based on a blockchain and web of trust model where the traditional CA and digital certificates are removed and instead, everything is registered on the blockchain. Registration, revocation, and update of public keys are based on a consensus mechanism between a certain number of entities that are already part of the system. Any node which is part of the system can be an auditor and initiate the revocation procedure once it finds out malicious activities. Revocation lists are no longer required as any node can efficiently verify the public keys through witnesses.",

    "abstract": "Energy storage units (ESUs) enable several attractive features of modern smart grids such as enhanced grid resilience, effective demand response, and reduced bills. However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses the power system and can lead to a blackout. On the other hand, existing charging coordination mechanisms suffer from several limitations. First, the need for a central charging coordinator (CC) presents a single point of failure that jeopardizes the effectiveness of the charging coordination. Second, a transparent charging coordination mechanism does not exist where users are not aware whether the CC is honest or not in coordination charging requests among them in a fair way. Third, existing mechanisms overlook the privacy concerns of the involved customers. To address these limitations, in this paper, we leverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging coordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator. First ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the blockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its State-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required charging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract will then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner such that ESUs with the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot while charging requests of lower priority ESUs are deferred to future time slots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules are computed correctly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum test-bed blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be acceptable in terms of gas consumption while enabling decentralized charging coordination with increased transparency, reliability, and privacy preserving.",

    "abstract": "In today's blockchain system, designing a secure and high throughput blockchain on par with a centralized payment system is a difficult task. Sharding is one of the most worthwhile emerging technologies for improving the system throughput while maintain high security level. However, previous sharding related designs have two main limitations: Firstly, the throughput of their random-based sharding system is not high enough as they did not leverage the heterogeneity among validators. Secondly, to design an incentive mechanism to promote cooperation could incur a huge overhead on their system. In this paper, we propose RepChain, a reputation-based secure and fast blockchain system via sharding, which also provides high incentive to stimulate node cooperation. RepChain utilizes reputation to explicitly characterize the heterogeneity among the validators and lay the foundation for the incentive mechanism. We propose a new double-chain architecture which includes transaction chain and reputation chain. For transaction chain, a Raft-based synchronous consensus that can achieve high throughput has been presented. For reputation chain, the synchronous Byzantine fault tolerance that combines collective signing has been utilized to achieve a consensus on both reputation score and the related transaction blocks. It supports a high throughput transaction chain with moderate generation speed. Moreover, we propose a reputation-based sharding and leader selection scheme. To analyze the security of RepChain, we propose a recursive formula to calculate the epoch security within only O(km^2) time. Furthermore, we implement and evaluate RepChain on the Amazon Web Service platform. The results show our solution can enhance both throughout and security level of the existing sharding-based blockchain system.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin uses blockchain technology and proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism where nodes spend computing resources and earn rewards in return for spending these resources. This incentive system has caused power to be significantly biased towards a few nodes, called mining pools. In fact, poor decentralization appears not only in PoW-based coins but also in coins adopting other mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS). In this paper, we target this centralization issue. To this end, we first define (m, \\varepsilon, \\delta)-decentralization as a state that satisfies 1) there are at least m participants running a node and 2) the ratio between the total resource power of nodes run by the richest and \\delta-th percentile participants is less than or equal to 1+\\varepsilon. To see if it is possible to achieve good decentralization, we introduce sufficient conditions for the incentive system of a blockchain to reach (m, \\varepsilon, \\delta)-decentralization. When satisfying the conditions, a blockchain system can reach full decentralization with probability 1. However, to achieve this, the blockchain system should be able to assign a positive Sybil cost, where the Sybil cost is defined as the difference between the cost for one participant running multiple nodes and the total cost for multiple participants each running one node. On the other hand, we prove that when there is no Sybil cost, the probability of reaching (m, \\varepsilon, \\delta)-decentralization is upper bounded by a value close to 0, considering a large rich-poor gap. To determine the conditions that each system cannot satisfy, we also analyze protocols of all PoW, PoS, and DPoS coins in the top 100 coins according to our conditions. Finally, we conduct data analysis of these coins to validate our theory.",

    "abstract": "Zero-Knowledge Proof-of-Identity from trusted public certificates (e.g., national identity cards and/or ePassports; eSIM) is introduced here to permissionless blockchains in order to remove the inefficiencies of Sybil-resistant mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (i.e., high energy and environmental costs) and Proof-of-Stake (i.e., capital hoarding and lower transaction volume). The proposed solution effectively limits the number of mining nodes a single individual would be able to run while keeping membership open to everyone, circumventing the impossibility of full decentralization and the blockchain scalability trilemma when instantiated on a blockchain with a consensus protocol based on the cryptographic random selection of nodes. Resistance to collusion is also considered. Solving one of the most pressing problems in blockchains, a zk-PoI cryptocurrency is proved to have the following advantageous properties: - an incentive-compatible protocol for the issuing of cryptocurrency rewards based on a unique Nash equilibrium - strict domination of mining over all other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies, thus the zk-PoI cryptocurrency becoming the preferred choice by miners is proved to be a Nash equilibrium and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy - PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies are condemned to pay the Price of Crypto-Anarchy, redeemed by the optimal efficiency of zk-PoI as it implements the social optimum - the circulation of a zk-PoI cryptocurrency Pareto dominates other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies - the network effects arising from the social networks inherent to national identity cards and ePassports dominate PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies - the lower costs of its infrastructure imply the existence of a unique equilibrium where it dominates other forms of payment",

    "abstract": "Home appliance manufacturers strive to obtain feedback from users to improve their products and services to build a smart home system. To help manufacturers develop a smart home system, we design a federated learning (FL) system leveraging the reputation mechanism to assist home appliance manufacturers to train a machine learning model based on customers' data. Then, manufacturers can predict customers' requirements and consumption behaviors in the future. The working flow of the system includes two stages: in the first stage, customers train the initial model provided by the manufacturer using both the mobile phone and the mobile edge computing (MEC) server. Customers collect data from various home appliances using phones, and then they download and train the initial model with their local data. After deriving local models, customers sign on their models and send them to the blockchain. In case customers or manufacturers are malicious, we use the blockchain to replace the centralized aggregator in the traditional FL system. Since records on the blockchain are untampered, malicious customers or manufacturers' activities are traceable. In the second stage, manufacturers select customers or organizations as miners for calculating the averaged model using received models from customers. By the end of the crowdsourcing task, one of the miners, who is selected as the temporary leader, uploads the model to the blockchain. To protect customers' privacy and improve the test accuracy, we enforce differential privacy on the extracted features and propose a new normalization technique. We experimentally demonstrate that our normalization technique outperforms batch normalization when features are under differential privacy protection. In addition, to attract more customers to participate in the crowdsourcing FL task, we design an incentive mechanism to award participants.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the first-ever blockchain which can simultaneously handle device and data security, which is important for the emerging Internet-of-Everything (IoE). This article presents a unique concept of blockchain that integrates hardware security primitives called Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to solve scalability, latency, and energy requirement challenges and is called PUFchain. Data management and security (and privacy) of data, devices, and individuals, are some of the issues in the IoE architectures that need to be resolved. Integrating the blockchain into the IoE environment can help solve these issues and helps in the aspects of data storage and security. This article introduces a new blockchain architecture called PUFchain and introduces a new consensus algorithm called \"Proof of PUF-Enabled Authentication\" (PoP) for deployment in PUFchain. The proposed PoP is the PUF integration into our previously proposed Proof-of-Authentication (PoAh) consensus algorithm and can be called \"Hardware-Assisted Proof-of-Authentication (HA-PoAh)\". However, PUF integration is possible in the existing and new consensus algorithms. PoP utilizes PUFs which are responsible for generating a unique key that cannot be cloned and hence provide the highest level of security. A PUF uses the nanoelectronic manufacturing variations that are introduced during the fabrication of an integrated circuit to generate the keys. Hence, once generated from a PUF module, the keys cannot be cloned or generated from any other module. PUFchain uses a PUF and Hashing module which performs the necessary cryptographic functions. Hence the mining process is offloaded to the hardware module which reduces the processing times. PoP is approximately 1,000X faster than the well-established Proof-of-Work (PoW) and 5X faster than Proof-of-Authentication (PoAh).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a new theoretical framework of pyramid Markov processes to solve some open and fundamental problems of blockchain selfish mining. To this end, we first describe a more general blockchain selfish mining with both a two-block leading competitive criterion and a new economic incentive, and establish a pyramid Markov process to express the dynamic behavior of the selfish mining from both consensus protocol and economic incentive. Then we show that the pyramid Markov process is stable and so is the blockchain, and its stationary probability vector is matrix-geometric with an explicitly representable rate matrix. Furthermore, we use the stationary probability vector to be able to analyze the waste of computational resource due to generating a lot of orphan (or stale) blocks. Nextly, we set up a pyramid Markov reward process to investigate the long-run average profits of the honest and dishonest mining pools, respectively. Specifically, we show that the long-run average profits are multivariate linear such that we can measure the improvement of mining efficiency of the dishonest mining pool comparing to the honest mining pool. As a by-product, we build three approximative Markov processes when the system states are described as the block-number difference of two forked block branches. Also, by using their special cases with non network latency, we can further provide some useful interpretation for both the Markov chain (Figure 1) and the revenue analysis ((1) to (3)) of the seminal work by Eyal and Sirer (2014). Finally, we use some numerical examples to verify the correctness and computability of our theoretical results. We hope that the methodology and results developed in this paper shed light on the blockchain selfish mining such that a series of promising research can be produced potentially.",

IoV has become an important research area of impactful applications in recent years due to the rapid advancements in vehicular technologies, high throughput satellite communication, Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems. IoV enables the integration of smart vehicles with the Internet and system components attributing to their environment such as public infrastructures, sensors, computing nodes, pedestrians and other vehicles. By allowing the development of a common information exchange platform between vehicles and heterogeneous vehicular networks, this integration aims to create a better environment and public space to the people as well as to enhance safety for all road users. Being a participatory data exchange and storage, the underlying information exchange platform of IoV needs to be secure, transparent and immutable in order to achieve the intended objectives of ITS. In this connection, the adoption of blockchain as a system platform for supporting the information exchange needs of IoV has been explored. Due to their decentralized and immutable nature, IoV applications enabled by blockchain are believed to have a number of desirable properties such as decentralization, security, transparency, immutability, and automation. In this paper, we present a contemporary survey on the latest advancement in blockchain for IoV. Particularly, we highlight the different application scenarios of IoV after carefully reviewing the recent literatures. We also investigate several key challenges where blockchain is applied in IoV. Furthermore, we present the future opportunities and explore further research directions of IoV as a key enabler of ITS.",

The large datasets required are generally proprietary; predictions are often sold on a per-query basis; and published models can quickly become out of date without effort to acquire more data and maintain them. Published proposals to provide models and data for free for certain tasks include Microsoft Research's Decentralized and Collaborative AI on Blockchain. The framework allows participants to collaboratively build a dataset and use smart contracts to share a continuously updated model on a public blockchain. The initial proposal gave an overview of the framework omitting many details of the models used and the incentive mechanisms in real world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate the use of several models and configurations in order to propose best practices when using the Self-Assessment incentive mechanism so that models can remain accurate and well-intended participants that submit correct data have the chance to profit. We have analyzed simulations for each of three models: Perceptron, Na\\\"ive Bayes, and a Nearest Centroid Classifier, with three different datasets: predicting a sport with user activity from Endomondo, sentiment analysis on movie reviews from IMDB, and determining if a news article is fake. We compare several factors for each dataset when models are hosted in smart contracts on a public blockchain: their accuracy over time, balances of a good and bad user, and transaction costs (or gas) for deploying, updating, collecting refunds, and collecting rewards. A free and open source implementation for the Ethereum blockchain and simulations written in Python is provided at https://github.com/microsoft/0xDeCA10B. This version has updated gas costs using newer optimizations written after the original publication.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain protocols differ in fundamental ways, including the mechanics of selecting users to produce blocks (e.g., proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake) and the method to establish consensus (e.g., longest chain rules vs. Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) inspired protocols). These fundamental differences have hindered \"apples-to-apples\" comparisons between different categories of blockchain protocols and, in turn, the development of theory to formally discuss their relative merits. This paper presents a parsimonious abstraction sufficient for capturing and comparing properties of many well-known permissionless blockchain protocols, simultaneously capturing essential properties of both proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, and of both longest-chain-type and BFT-type protocols. Our framework blackboxes the precise mechanics of the user selection process, allowing us to isolate the properties of the selection process that are significant for protocol design. We demonstrate the utility of our general framework with several concrete results: 1. We prove a CAP-type impossibility theorem asserting that liveness with an unknown level of participation rules out security in a partially synchronous setting. 2. Delving deeper into the partially synchronous setting, we prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for security is the production of \"certificates,\" meaning stand-alone proofs of block confirmation. 3. Restricting to synchronous settings, we prove that typical protocols with a known level of participation (including longest chain-type PoS protocols) can be adapted to provide certificates, but those with an unknown level of participation cannot. 4. Finally, we use our framework to articulate a modular two-step approach to blockchain security analysis that effectively reduces the permissionless case to the permissioned case.",

    "abstract": "Today's world is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, as one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. During the lockdown caused by this disease, many financial losses have been inflicted on people and all industries. One of the fastest ways to save these industries from the COVID-19 is to provide a reliable solution for people's health assessment. In this article, blockchain technology is used to propose a model which provides and validates the health certificates for people who travel or present in society. For this purpose, we take advantage of blockchain features in protecting people's privacy. Since a variety of antibody and human health proving tests against the virus are developing, this study tries simultaneously to design an integrated and secure system to meet the authenticity and accuracy of different people's health certificates for the companies requiring these certifications. In this system, on the one hand, there are qualified laboratories that are responsible for performing standard testing and also providing results to the system controller. Finally, people are considered as the end-user of the system. To provide test information for the entities, the mechanism of KYC tokens will be used based on the Stellar private blockchain network. In this mechanism, the user will buy a certain amount of KYC tokens from the system controller. These tokens are charged in the user's wallet, and the user can send these tokens from his wallet to any destination company, to exchange the encrypted health certificate information. Finally, considering the appropriate platform provided by blockchain technology and the requirement of a reliable and accurate solution for issuing health certificates during the Covid-19 pandemic or any other disease, this article offers a solution to meet the requirements.",

    "abstract": "Condominium network refers to intra-organization networks, where smart buildings or apartments are connected and share resources over the network. Secured communication platform or channel has been highlighted as a key requirement for a reliable condominium which can be ensured by the utilization of the advanced techniques and platforms like Software-Defined Network (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Blockchain (BC). These technologies provide a robust, and secured platform to meet all kinds of challenges, such as safety, confidentiality, flexibility, efficiency, and availability. This work suggests a distributed, scalable IoT-SDN with Blockchain-based NFV framework for a smart condominium (DistB-Condo) that can act as an efficient secured platform for a small community. Moreover, the Blockchain-based IoT-SDN with NFV framework provides the combined benefits of leading technologies. It also presents an optimized Cluster Head Selection (CHS) algorithm for selecting a Cluster Head (CH) among the clusters that efficiently saves energy. Besides, a decentralized and secured Blockchain approach has been introduced that allows more prominent security and privacy to the desired condominium network. Our proposed approach has also the ability to detect attacks in an IoT environment. Eventually, this article evaluates the performance of the proposed architecture using different parameters (e.g., throughput, packet arrival rate, and response time). The proposed approach outperforms the existing OF-Based SDN. DistB-Condo has better throughput on average, and the bandwidth (Mbps) much higher than the OF-Based SDN approach in the presence of attacks. Also, the proposed model has an average response time of 5% less than the core model.",

    ],
    "abstract": "There has recently been a flood of interest in potential new applications of blockchains, as well as proposals for more generic designs called public ledgers. Most of the novel proposals have been in the financial sector. However, the public ledger is an abstraction that solves several of the fundamental problems in the design of secure distributed systems: global time in the form of a strict linear order of past events, globally consistent and immutable view of the history, and enforcement of some application-specific safety properties. This paper investigates the applications of public ledgers to access control and, more specifically, to group management in distributed systems where entities are represented by their public keys and authorization is encoded into signed certificates. It is particularly difficult to handle negative information, such as revocation of certificates or group membership, in the distributed setting. The linear order of events and global consistency simplify these problems, but the enforcement of internal constraints in the ledger implementation often presents problems. We show that different types of revocation require slightly different properties from the ledger. We compare the requirements with Bitcoin, the best known blockchain, and describe an efficient ledger design for membership revocation that combines ideas from blockchains and from web-PKI monitoring. While we use certificate-based group-membership management as the case study, the same ideas can be applied more widely to rights revocation in distributed systems.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology, which has been known by mostly small technological circles up until recently, is bursting throughout the globe, with a potential economic and social impact that could fundamentally alter traditional financial and social structures. Issuing cryptocurrencies on top of the Blockchain system by startups and private sector companies is becoming a ubiquitous phenomenon, inducing the trading of these crypto-coins among their holders using dedicated exchanges. Apart from being a trading ledger for tokens, Blockchain can also be observed as a social network. Analyzing and modeling the dynamics of the \"social signals\" of this network can contribute to our understanding of this ecosystem and the forces acting within in. This work is the first analysis of the network properties of the ERC20 protocol compliant crypto-coins' trading data. Considering all trading wallets as a network's nodes, and constructing its edges using buy--sell trades, we can analyze the network properties of the ERC20 network. Examining several periods of time, and several data aggregation variants, we demonstrate that the network displays strong power-law properties. These results coincide with current network theory expectations, however nonetheless, are the first scientific validation of it, for the ERC20 trading data. The data we examined is composed of over 30 million ERC20 tokens trades, performed by over 6.8 million unique wallets, lapsing over a two years period between February 2016 and February 2018.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin, as well as many of its successors, require the whole transaction record to be reliably acquired by all nodes to prevent double-spending. Recently, many blockchains have been proposed to achieve scale-out throughput by letting nodes only acquire a fraction of the whole transaction set. However, these schemes, e.g., sharding and off-chain techniques, suffer from a degradation in decentralization or the capacity of fault tolerance. In this paper, we show that the complete set of transactions is not a necessity for the prevention of double-spending if the properties of value transfers is fully explored. In other words, we show that a value-transfer ledger like Bitcoin has the potential to scale-out by its nature without sacrificing security or decentralization. Firstly, we give a formal definition for the value-transfer ledger and its distinct features from a generic database. Then, we introduce an off-chain based scheme with a shared main chain for consensus and an individual chain for each node for recording transactions. A locally executable validation scheme is proposed with uncompromising validity and consistency. A beneficial consequence of our design is that nodes will spontaneously try to reduce their transmission cost by only providing the transactions needed to show that their transactions are double-spending-proof. As a result, the network is sharded as each node only acquires part of the transaction record and a scale-out throughput could be achieved, which we call \"spontaneous sharding\".",

    "abstract": "Banking as an essential service can be hard to access in remote, rural regions where the network connectivity is intermittent. Although micro-banking has been made possible by SMS or USSD messages in some places, their security flaws and session-based nature prevent them from a wider adoption. Global level cryptocurrencies enable low-cost, secure and pervasive money transferring among distributed peers, but are still limited in their ability to reach more people in remote communities. We proposed to take advantage of the delay-tolerant nature of blockchains to deliver banking services to remote communities that only connect to the broader Internet intermittently. Using a base station that offers connectivity within the local area, regular transaction processing is solely handled by blockchain miners. The bank only joins to process currency exchange requests, reward miners and track user balances when the connection is available. By distributing the verification and storage tasks among peers, our system design saves on the overall deployment and operational costs without sacrificing the reliability and trustwor- thiness. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we provided insights to system design, tested its robustness against network disturbances, and demonstrated the feasibility of implementation on off-the-shelf computers and mobile devices.",

One such application that is becoming crucial with the introduction of self-driving cars is the forensic analysis for traffic accidents. The utilization of vehicle-related data can be instrumental in post-accident scenarios to find out the faulty party, particularly for self-driving vehicles. With the opportunity of being able to access various information on the cars, we propose a permissioned blockchain framework among the various elements involved to manage the collected vehicle-related data. Specifically, we first integrate Vehicular Public Key Management (VPKI) to the proposed blockchain to provide membership establishment and privacy. Next, we design a fragmented ledger that will store detailed data related to vehicle such as maintenance information/history, car diagnosis reports, etc. The proposed forensic framework enables trustless, traceable and privacy-aware post-accident analysis with minimal storage and processing overhead.",

    "abstract": "Information from surveillance video is essential for situational awareness (SAW). Nowadays, a prohibitively large amount of surveillance data is being generated continuously by ubiquitously distributed video sensors. It is very challenging to immediately identify the objects of interest or zoom in suspicious actions from thousands of video frames. Making the big data indexable is critical to tackle this problem. It is ideal to generate pattern indexes in a real-time, on-site manner on the video streaming instead of depending on the batch processing at the cloud centers. The modern edge-fog-cloud computing paradigm allows implementation of time sensitive tasks at the edge of the network. The on-site edge devices collect the information sensed in format of frames and extracts useful features. The near-site fog nodes conduct the contextualization and classification of the features. The remote cloud center is in charge of more data intensive and computing intensive tasks. However, exchanging the index information among devices in different layers raises security concerns where an adversary can capture or tamper with features to mislead the surveillance system. In this paper, a blockchain enabled scheme is proposed to protect the index data through an encrypted secure channel between the edge and fog nodes. It reduces the chance of attacks on the small edge and fog devices. The feasibility of the proposal is validated through intensive experimental analysis.",

The state-of-the-art protocols include Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake and Delegated-Proof-of-Stake. Proof-of-Work urges nodes to prove their computing power measured in hash rate in a crypto-puzzle solving competition. The other two take into account the amount of stake of each nodes and even design a vote in Delegated-Proof-of-Stake. However, these frameworks have several drawbacks, such as consuming a large number of electricity, leading the whole blockchain to a centralized system and so on. In this paper, we propose the conceptual framework, fundamental theory and research methodology, based on artificial intelligence technology that exploits nearly complementary information of each nodes.

    "abstract": "Bitcoin blockchain faces the bitcoin scalability problem, for which bitcoin's blocks contain the transactions on the bitcoin network. The on-chain transaction processing capacity of the bitcoin network is limited by the average block creation time of 10 minutes and the block size limit. These jointly constrain the network's throughput. The transaction processing capacity maximum is estimated between 3.3 and 7 transactions per second (TPS). A Layer2 Network, named Lightning Network, is proposed and activated solutions to address this problem. LN operates on top of the bitcoin network as a cache to allow payments to be affected that are not immediately put on the blockchain. However, it also brings some drawbacks. In this paper, we observe a specific payment issue among current LN, which requires additional claims to blockchain and is time-consuming. We call the issue as shares issue. Therefore, we propose Rapido to explicitly address the shares issue. Furthermore, a new smart contract, D-HTLC, is equipped with Rapido as the payment protocol. We finally provide a proof of concept implementation and simulation for both Rapido and LN, in which Rapdio not only mitigates the shares issue but also mitigates the skewness issue thus is proved to be more applicable for various transactions than LN.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are a new paradigm that emerged with the rise of the blockchain technology. They allow untrusting parties to arrange agreements. These agreements are encoded as a programming language code and deployed on a blockchain platform, where all participants execute them and maintain their state. Smart contracts are promising since they are automated and decentralized, thus limiting the involvement of third trusted parties, and can contain monetary transfers. Due to these features, many people believe that smart contracts will revolutionize the way we think of distributed applications, information sharing, financial services, and infrastructures. To release the potential of smart contracts, it is necessary to connect the contracts with the outside world, such that they can understand and use information from other infrastructures. For instance, smart contracts would greatly benefit when they have access to web content. However, there are many challenges associated with realizing such a system, and despite the existence of many proposals, no solution is secure, provides easily-parsable data, introduces small overheads, and is easy to deploy. In this paper we propose PDFS, a practical system for data feeds that combines the advantages of the previous schemes and introduces new functionalities. PDFS extends content providers by including new features for data transparency and consistency validations. This combination provides multiple benefits like content which is easy to parse and efficient authenticity verification without breaking natural trust chains. PDFS keeps content providers auditable, mitigates their malicious activities (like data modification or censorship), and allows them to create a new business model. We show how PDFS is integrated with existing web services, report on a PDFS implementation and present results from conducted case studies and experiments.",

    "abstract": "The rise of modern blockchains has facilitated the emergence of smart contracts: autonomous programs that live and run on the blockchain. Smart contracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in law, business, commerce, and governance. Smart contracts are commonly written in a high-level language such as Ethereum's Solidity, and translated to compact low-level bytecode for deployment on the blockchain. Once deployed, the bytecode is autonomously executed, usually by a %Turing-complete virtual machine. As with all programs, smart contracts can be highly vulnerable to malicious attacks due to deficient programming methodologies, languages, and toolchains, including buggy compilers. At the same time, smart contracts are also high-value targets, often commanding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Hence, developers and auditors need security frameworks capable of analysing low-level bytecode to detect potential security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present Vandal: a security analysis framework for Ethereum smart contracts. Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts low-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode to semantic logic relations. Users of the framework can express security analyses in a declarative fashion: a security analysis is expressed in a logic specification written in the \\souffle language. We conduct a large-scale empirical study for a set of common smart contract security vulnerabilities, and show the effectiveness and efficiency of Vandal. Vandal is both fast and robust, successfully analysing over 95\\% of all 141k unique contracts with an average runtime of 4.15 seconds; outperforming the current state of the art tools---Oyente, EthIR, Mythril, and Rattle---under equivalent conditions.",

    "abstract": "Low transaction throughput and poor scalability are significant issues in public blockchain consensus protocols such as Bitcoins. Recent research efforts in this direction have proposed shard-based consensus protocols where the key idea is to split the transactions among multiple committees (or shards), which then process these shards or set of transactions in parallel. Such a parallel processing of disjoint sets of transactions or shards by multiple committees significantly improves the overall scalability and transaction throughout of the system. However, one significant research gap is a lack of understanding of the strategic behavior of rational processors within committees in such shard-based consensus protocols. Such an understanding is critical for designing appropriate incentives that will foster cooperation within committees and prevent free-riding. In this paper, we address this research gap by analyzing the behavior of processors using a game-theoretic model, where each processor aims at maximizing its reward at a minimum cost of participating in the protocol. We first analyze the Nash equilibria in an N-player static game model of the sharding protocol. We show that depending on the reward sharing approach employed, processors can potentially increase their payoff by unilaterally behaving in a defective fashion, thus resulting in a social dilemma. In order to overcome this social dilemma, we propose a novel incentive-compatible reward sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among processors. Our numerical results show that achieving a majority of cooperating processors (required to ensure a healthy state of the blockchain network) is easier to achieve with the proposed incentive-compatible reward sharing mechanism than with other reward sharing mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In Internet of Vehicles (IoV), data sharing among vehicles is essential to improve driving safety and enhance vehicular services. To ensure data sharing security and traceability, highefficiency Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus scheme as a hard security solution is utilized to establish blockchain-enabled IoV (BIoV). However, as miners are selected from miner candidates by stake-based voting, it is difficult to defend against voting collusion between the candidates and compromised high-stake vehicles, which introduces serious security challenges to the BIoV. To address such challenges, we propose a soft security enhancement solution including two stages: (i) miner selection and (ii) block verification. In the first stage, a reputation-based voting scheme for the blockchain is proposed to ensure secure miner selection. This scheme evaluates candidates' reputation by using both historical interactions and recommended opinions from other vehicles. The candidates with high reputation are selected to be active miners and standby miners. In the second stage, to prevent internal collusion among the active miners, a newly generated block is further verified and audited by the standby miners. To incentivize the standby miners to participate in block verification, we formulate interactions between the active miners and the standby miners by using contract theory, which takes block verification security and delay into consideration. Numerical results based on a real-world dataset indicate that our schemes are secure and efficient for data sharing in BIoV.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin's enormous success has inspired the development of alternative blockchains, such as consortium chains. Several cross-chain protocols have been proposed as ways of connecting these universes of individual blockchains in a distributed and secure manner. In this paper, we present Niji, a new cross-chain protocol that allows parties to perform virtual Bitcoin payment securely on a consortium chain, without any trusted third-party or mediators. Our work focuses on the issue that it is difficult for a consortium chain's token to hold a stable market value, and Niji makes it possible for smart contract services to acquire means of payment in the consortium chain. With the Bitcoin payment channel built on the consortium chain, the process from payment to service provision runs autonomously without any interaction between parties. Niji introduces the concept of a transaction template to validate Bitcoin payments efficiently on different blockchains, and it allows a service provider to delegate all of its tasks for verifying state updates to a smart contract on the consortium chain. We also propose a novel bi-directional payment channel adapted for design of the Niji protocol, which can update payments non-interactively between parties. We implemented a prototype of the Niji protocol and conducted an experiment measuring the computational cost and latency that demonstrates the protocol's feasibility on practical platforms.",

Most of the current IoT systems are using centralized cloud-based data sharing systems, which will be difficult to scale up to meet the demands of future IoT systems. Involvement of such third-party service provider requires also trust from both sensor owner and sensor data user. Moreover, the fees need to be paid for their services. To tackle both the scalability and trust issues and to automatize the payments, this paper presents a blockchain based proxy re-encryption scheme. The system stores the IoT data in a distributed cloud after encryption. To share the collected IoT data, the system establishes runtime dynamic smart contracts between the sensor and data user without the involvement of a trusted third party. It also uses a very efficient proxy re-encryption scheme which allows that the data is only visible by the owner and the person present in the smart contract. This novel combination of smart contracts with proxy re-encryption provides an efficient, fast and secure platform for storing, trading and managing of sensor data. The proposed system is implemented in an Ethereum based testbed to analyze the performance and the security properties.",

Ethereum is gaining a significant popularity in blockchain community, mainly due to the fact that it is designed in a way that enables developers to write smart contracts and decentralized applications (Dapps). There are many kinds of cryptocurrency information on the social network. The risks and fraud problems behind it have pushed many countries including the United States, South Korea, and China to make warnings and set up corresponding regulations. However, the security of Ethereum smart contracts has not gained much attention. Through the Deep Learning approach, we propose a method of sentiment analysis for Ethereum's community comments. In this research, we first collected the users' cryptocurrency comments from the social network and then fed to our LSTM + CNN model for training. Then we made prediction through sentiment analysis. With our research result, we have demonstrated that both the precision and the recall of sentiment analysis can achieve 0.80+. More importantly, we deploy our sentiment analysis1 on RatingToken and Coin Master (mobile application of Cheetah Mobile Blockchain Security Center23).

The particular information being shared by a user may be legitimate or fake. Sometimes a misinformation, propagated by users and group can create chaos or in some cases, might leads to cases of riots. Nowadays the third party like ALT news and Cobrapost check the information authenticity, but it takes too much time to validate the news. Therefore, a robust and new system is required to check the information authenticity within the network, to stop the propagation of misinformation. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based framework for sharing the information securely at the peer level. In the blockchain model, a chain is created by combining blocks of information. Each node of network propagates the information based on its credibility to its peer nodes. The credibility of a node will vary according to the respective information. Trust is calculated between sender and receiver in two ways:(i) Local trust used for sharing information at the peer level and (ii) global trust is used for a credibility check of each user in the network. We evaluate our framework using real dataset derived from Facebook. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 83% which shows the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

An operational model of CESs in distribution networks is presented considering various types of energy trading transactions and crowdsourcees. Then, a two-phase operation algorithm is presented: Phase I focuses on the day-ahead scheduling of generation and controllable DERs, whereas Phase II is developed for hour-ahead or real-time operation of distribution networks. The developed approach supports seamless P2P energy trading between individual prosumers and/or the utility. The presented operational model can also be used to operate islanded microgrids. The CES framework and the operation algorithm are then prototyped through an efficient blockchain implementation, namely the IBM Hyperledger Fabric. This implementation allows the system operator to manage the network users to seamlessly trade energy. Case studies and prototype illustration are provided.",

Thus, it is essential to update these IoT devices securely, patching their vulnerabilities and protecting the safety of the involved users. Existing studies deliver secure and reliable updates based on blockchain network which serves as the transmission network. However, these approaches could compromise users privacy when updating the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain based privacy-preserving software updates protocol, which delivers secure and reliable updates with an incentive mechanism, as well protects the privacy of involved users. The vendor delivers the updates and it makes a commitment by using a smart contract to provide financial incentive to the transmission nodes who deliver the updates to the IoT devices. A transmission node gets financial incentive by providing a proof-of-delivery. The transmission node uses double authentication preventing signature (DAPS) to carry out the fair exchange to obtain the proof-of-delivery. Specifically, the transmission node exchanges an attribute-based signature from a IoT device by using DAPS. Then, it uses the attribute-based signature as a proof-of-delivery to receive financial incentives. Generally, the IoT device has to execute complex computation for an attribute-based signature (ABS). It is intolerable for resource limited devices. We propose a concrete outsourced attribute-based signature (OABS) scheme to resist the weakness. Then, we prove the security of the proposed OABS and the protocol as well. Finally, we implement smart contract in Solidity to demonstrate the validity of the proposed protocol.",

Therefore, to bridge the fragmented siloed information across global supply chain partners, the diffusion of blockchain (BC) as one of the advanced distributed ledger technology (DLT) takeover the on-premise legacy systems. Nevertheless, the challenging constraints of blockchain including scalability, accessing off-line data, fee-less microtransactions and many more lead to the third wave of blockchain called IOTA. In this paper, we propose a framework for supporting provenance in the electronic supply chain (ECS) by using permissioned IOTA ledger. Realizing the crucial requirement of trustworthy data, we use Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) channel provided by IOTA that allows the SC players to procure distributed information while keeping confidential trade flows, tamper-proof data, and fine-grained accessibility rights. To identify operational disruption, we devise a transparent product ledger through transaction data and consignment information to keep track of the complete product journey at each intermediary step during SC processes. Furthermore, we evaluate the secure provenance data construction time for varying payload size.",

These sensitive and private data should only be accessed by authorized users. Given a total medical data, users may care about parts of them and other unrelated information might interfere with the user interested data search and increase the risk of exposure. Besides accessing these data, users may want to update them and propagate to other sharing peers so that all peers keep identical data after each update. To satisfy these requirements, in this paper we propose a medical data sharing architecture that addresses the permission control using smart contracts on the blockchain and splits data into fined grained pieces shared with different peers then synchronize full data and these pieces with bidirectional transformations. Medical data reside on each user\\'s local database and permission related data are stored on smart contracts. Only all peers have gained the newest shared data after updates can they start to do next operations on it, which are enforced by smart contracts. Blockchain based immutable shared ledge enables users to trace data updates history. This paper can provide a new perspective to view full medical data as different slices to be shared with various peers but consistency after updates between them are still promised, which can protect the privacy and improve data search efficiency.",

However, errors can become a significant issue if the unsafe program is used for critical systems. Therefore, formal methods for these kinds of systems are greatly required. In this paper, we use a formal language that performs deductive verification on an Ethereum Blockchain application based on smart contracts, which are self-executing digital contracts. Blockchain systems manipulate cryptocurrency and transaction information. Therefore , if a bug occurs in the blockchain, serious consequences such as a loss of money can happen. Thus, the aim of this paper is to propose a language dedicated to deductive verification, called Why3, as a new language for writing formal and verified smart contracts, thereby avoiding attacks exploiting such contract execution vulnerabilities. We first write a Why3 smart contracts program; next we formulate specifications to be proved as absence of RunTime Error properties and functional properties, then we verify the behavior of the program using the Why3 system. Finally we compile the Why3 contracts to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Moreover, we give a set of generic mathematical statements that allows verifying functional properties suited to any type of smart contracts holding cryptocurrency, showing that Why3 can be a suitable language to write smart contracts. To illustrate our approach, we describe its application to a realistic industrial use case.",

For example, 5G has a new level of data transfer and processing speed that assures users are not disconnected when they move from one cell to another; thus, supporting faster connection. However, it comes with its own technical challenges relating to resource management, authentication handover and user privacy protection. In 5G, the frequent displacement of the users among the cells as a result of repeated authentication handovers often lead to a delay, contradicting the 5G objectives. In this paper, we propose a new authentication approach that utilizes blockchain and software defined networking (SDN) techniques to remove the re-authentication in repeated handover among heterogeneous cells. The proposed approach is designed to assure the low delay, appropriate for the 5G network in which users can be replaced with the least delay among heterogeneous cells using their public and private keys provided by the devised blockchain component while protecting their privacy. In our comparison between Proof-of-Work (POW)-based and network-based models, the delay of our authentication handover was shown to be less than 1ms. Also, our approach demonstrated less signaling overhead and energy consumption compared to peer models.",

    "abstract": "Smart contract transactions demonstrate issues of performance and correctness that application programmers must work around. Although the blockchain consensus mechanism approaches ACID compliance, use cases that rely on frequent state changes are impractical due to the block publishing interval of $O(10^1)$ seconds. The effective isolation level is Read-Committed, only revealing state transitions at the end of the block interval. Values read may be stale and not match program order, causing many transactions to fail when a block is committed. This paper perceives the blockchain as a transactional data structure, using this analogy in the development of a new algorithm, Hash-Mark-Set (HMS), that improves transaction throughput by providing a Read-Uncommitted view of state variables. HMS creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from the pending transaction pool. The transaction order derived from the DAG is used to provide a Read-Uncommitted view of the data for new transactions, which enter the DAG as they are received. An implementation of HMS is provided, interoperable with Ethereum and ready for use in smart contracts. Over a wide range of transaction mixes, HMS is demonstrated to improve throughput. A side product of the implementation is a new technique, Runtime Argument Augmentation (RAA), that allows smart contracts to communicate with external data services before submitting a transaction. RAA has use cases beyond HMS and can serve as a lightweight replacement for blockchain oracles.",

    "abstract": "Ethereum smart contracts are executable programs, deployed on a peer-to-peer network and executed in a consensus-based fashion. Their bytecode is public, immutable and once deployed to the blockchain, cannot be patched anymore. As smart contracts may hold Ether worth of several million dollars, they are attractive targets for attackers and indeed some contracts have successfully been exploited in the recent past, resulting in tremendous financial losses. The correctness of smart contracts is thus of utmost importance. While first approaches on formal verification exist, they demand users to be well-versed in formal methods which are alien to many developers and are only able to analyze individual contracts, without considering their execution environment, i.e., calls to external contracts, sequences of transaction, and values from the actual blockchain storage. In this paper, we present Annotary, a concolic execution framework to analyze smart contracts for vulnerabilities, supported by annotations which developers write directly in the Solidity source code. In contrast to existing work, Annotary supports analysis of inter-transactional, inter-contract control flows and combines symbolic execution of EVM bytecode with a resolution of concrete values from the public Ethereum blockchain. While the analysis of Annotary tends to weight precision higher than soundness, we analyze inter-transactional call chains to eliminate false positives from unreachable states that traditional symbolic execution would not be able to handle. We present the annotation and analysis concepts of Annotary, explain its implementation on top of the Laser symbolic virtual machine, and demonstrate its usage as a plugin for the Sublime Text editor.",

Similar to previous consensus protocol verification efforts, we model the protocol as a state transition system and reason over reachable global states. However, in contrast to previous work, our model explicitly incorporates timing issues (e.g., timeouts and network delays) and adversarial actions, reflecting a more realistic environment faced by a public blockchain. Thus far, we have proved asynchronous safety of the protocol: two different blocks cannot be certified in the same round, even when the adversary has complete control of message delivery in the network. We believe that our model is sufficiently general and other relevant properties of the protocol such as liveness can be proved for the same model.",

Blockchain technology shows promise in being a key enabler of TES, allowing agents to engage in trustless, persistent transactions that are both enforceable and auditable. To that end, this paper proposes a blockchain based TES that enables agents to receive incentives for providing voltage regulation services by i) maintaining an auditable reputation rating for each agent that is increased proportionately with each mitigation of a voltage violation, ii) utilizing smart contracts to enforce the validity of each transaction and penalize reputation ratings in case of a mitigation failure and iii) automating the negotiation and bidding of agent services by implementing the contract net protocol (CNP) as a smart contract. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world ADNs are executed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system.",

    "abstract": "Payment networks were introduced to address the limitation on the transaction throughput of popular blockchains. To open a payment channel one has to publish a transaction on-chain and pay the appropriate transaction fee. A transaction can be routed in the network, as long as there is a path of channels with the necessary capital. The intermediate nodes on this path can ask for a fee to forward the transaction. Hence, opening channels, although costly, can benefit a party, both by reducing the cost of the party for sending a transaction and by collecting the fees from forwarding transactions of other parties. This trade-off spawns a network creation game between the channel parties. In this work, we introduce the first game theoretic model for analyzing the network creation game on blockchain payment channels. Further, we examine various network structures (path, star, complete bipartite graph and clique) and determine for each one of them the constraints (fee value) under which they constitute a Nash equilibrium, given a fixed fee policy. Last, we show that the star is a Nash equilibrium when each channel party can freely decide the channel fee. On the other hand, we prove the complete bipartite graph can never be a Nash equilibrium, given a free fee policy.",

    "abstract": "Since it takes time and effort to put a new product or service on the market, one would like to predict whether it will be a success. In general this is not possible, but it is possible to follow best practices in order to maximise the chance of success. A smart contract is intended to encode business logic and is therefore at the heart of every new business on the Ethereum blockchain. We have investigated how to measure the success of smart contracts, and whether successful smart contracts have characteristics that less successful smart contracts lack. The appearance of a smart contract on a listing website such as Etherscan or StateoftheDapps is such a characteristic. In this paper, we present a three-pronged analysis of the relative success of listed smart contracts. First, we have used statistical analysis on the publicly visible transaction history of the Ethereum blockchain to determine that listed contracts are significantly more successful than their unlisted counterparts. Next, we have conducted a survey among more than 200 developers via an anonymous online survey about their experience with the listing process. A significant majority of respondents do not believe that listing a contract itself contributes to its success, but they believe that the extra attention that is typically paid in tandem with the listing process does contribute. Finally, based on the respondents' answers, we have drafted 10 recommendations for developers and validated them by submitting them to an international panel of experts.",

    "abstract": "A blockchain and smart contract enabled security mechanism for IoT applications has been reported recently for urban, financial, and network services. However, due to the power-intensive and a low-throughput consensus mechanism in existing blockchain, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are still challenges in integrating blockchain technology into resource-constrained IoT platforms. In this paper, Microchain, based on a hybrid Proof-of-Credit (PoC)-Voting-based Chain Finality (VCF) consensus protocol, is proposed to provide a secure, scalable and lightweight distributed ledger for IoT systems. By using a bias-resistant randomness protocol and a cryptographic sortition algorithm, a random subset of nodes are selected as a final committee to perform the consensus protocol. The hybrid consensus mechanism relies on PoC, a pure Proof of stake (PoS) protocol, to determine whether or not a participant is qualified to propose a block, given a fair initial distribution of the credit assignment. The voting-based chain finality protocol is responsible for finalizing a history of blocks by resolving conflicting checkpoint and selecting a unique chain. A proof-of-conception prototype is implemented and tested on a physical network environment. The experimental results verify that the Micorchain is able to offer a partially decentralized, scalable and lightweight distributed ledger protocol for IoT applications.",

The existing publication platforms have some severe drawbacks. First, instead of promoting widespread knowledge sharing, access to publications on the platforms owned by publishers is often on a fee basis. This drawback of pay wall prevents researchers from \"standing on the shoulders of giants\". Moreover, the peer review process on most all existing publication platforms (including both open-access and publisher platforms) is prone to be ineffective, since there is no proper incentive to reviewers for performing high-qualified reviews. PubChain is an alternative platform to the existing publication venues aiming to address their drawbacks. No central third-party owns the contents (i.e., papers and reviews) of PubChain. Exploiting blockchain technology, we devise an elaborate incentive scheme on PubChain to incentivize key stakeholders (i.e., authors, readers and reviewers) to participate publication activities on PubChain in a substantive manner by earning credits and rewards through self-motivated interactions. We have performed simulations to investigate the robustness of our proposed incentive scheme against fraudulent publications and reviews.

    "abstract": "Ride-hailing and ride-sharing applications have recently gained in popularity as a convenient alternative to traditional modes of travel. Current research into autonomous vehicles is accelerating rapidly and will soon become a critical component of a ride-hailing platform's architecture. Implementing an autonomous vehicle ride-hailing platform proves a difficult challenge due to the centralized nature of traditional ride-hailing architectures. In a traditional ride-hailing environment the drivers operate their own personal vehicles so it follows that a fleet of autonomous vehicles would be required for a centralized ride-hailing platform to succeed. Decentralization of the ride-hailing platform would remove a road block along the way to an autonomous vehicle ride-hailing platform by allowing owners of autonomous vehicles to add their vehicle to a community driven fleet when not in use. Blockchain technology is an attractive choice for this decentralized architecture due to its immutability and fault tolerance. This paper proposes a framework for developing a decentralized ride-hailing architecture implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. The implementation is evaluated using a static analysis tool and performing a performance analysis under heavy network load.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is maintained as a global log between a network of nodes and uses cryptographic distributed protocols to synchronize the updates. As adopted by Bitcoin and Ethereum these update operations to the ledger are serialized, and executed in batches. To safeguard the system against the generation of conflicting sets of updates and maintain the consistency of the ledger, the frequency of the updates is controlled, which severely affects the performance of the system. This paper presents Converging Directed Acyclic Graph (CDAG), as a substitute for the chain and DAG structures used in other blockchain protocols. CDAG allows multiple parallel updates to the ledger and converges them at the next step providing finality to the blocks. It partitions the updates into non-intersecting buckets of transactions to prevent the generation of conflicting blocks and divide the time into slots to provide enough time for them to propagate in the network. Multiple simultaneous updates improve the throughput of CDAG, and the converging step helps to finalize them faster, even in the presence of conflicts. Moreover, CDAG provides a total order among the blocks of the ledger to support smart contracts, unlike some of the other blockDAG protocols. We evaluate the performance of CDAG on Google Cloud Platform using Google Kubernetes Engine, simulating a real-time network. Experimental results show that CDAG achieves a throughput of more than 2000 transactions per second and confirms them well in under 2 minutes. Also, the protocol scales well in comparison to other permissioned protocols, and the capacity of the network only limits the performance.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin-NG, a scalable blockchain protocol, divides each block into a key block and many micro blocks to effectively improve the transaction processing capacity. Bitcoin-NG has a special incentive mechanism (i.e. splitting transaction fees to the current and the next leader) to maintain its security. However, this design of the incentive mechanism ignores the joint effect of transaction fees, mint coins and mining duration lengths on the expected mining reward. In this paper, we identify the advanced mining attack that deliberately ignores micro blocks to enlarge the mining duration length to increase the likelihood of winning the mining race. We first show that an advanced mining attacker can maximize its expected reward by optimizing its mining duration length. We then formulate a game-theoretical model in which multiple mining players perform advanced mining to compete with each other. We analyze the Nash equilibrium for the mining game. Our analytical and simulation results indicate that all mining players in the mining game converge to having advanced mining at the equilibrium and have no incentives for deviating from the equilibrium; the transaction processing capability of the Bitcoin-NG network at the equilibrium is decreased by advanced mining. Therefore, we conclude that the Bitcoin-NG blockchain protocol is vulnerable to advanced mining attack. We discuss how to reduce the negative impact of advanced mining for Bitcoin-NG.",

While encouraging, this is leading to the emergence of new data, asset and process silos limiting the potential value these networks bring to the broader ecosystem. Mechanisms for enabling network interoperability help preserve the benefits of independent sovereign networks, while allowing for the transfer or sharing of data, assets and processes across network boundaries. However, a naive approach to interoperability based on traditional point-to-point integration is insufficient for preserving the underlying trust decentralized networks provide. In this paper, we lay the foundation for an approach to interoperability based on a communication protocol that derives trust from the underlying network consensus protocol. We present an architecture and a set of building blocks that can be adapted for use in a range of network implementations and demonstrate a proof-of-concept for trusted data-sharing between two independent trade finance and supply-chain networks, each running on Hyperledger Fabric. We show how existing blockchain deployments can be adapted for interoperation and discuss the security and extensibility of our architecture and mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Some of the recent blockchain proposals, such as Stellar and Ripple, allow for open membership while using quorum-like structures typical for classical Byzantine consensus with closed membership. This is achieved by constructing quorums in a decentralised way: each participant independently chooses whom to trust, and quorums arise from these individual decisions. Unfortunately, the consensus protocols underlying such blockchains are poorly understood, and their correctness has not been rigorously investigated. In this paper we rigorously prove correct the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), with our proof giving insights into the protocol structure and its use of lower-level abstractions. To this end, we first propose an abstract version of SCP that uses as a black box Stellar's federated voting primitive (analogous to reliable Byzantine broadcast), previously investigated by Garc\\'ia-P\\'erez and Gotsman. The abstract consensus protocol highlights a modular structure in Stellar and can be proved correct by reusing the previous results on federated voting. However, it is unsuited for realistic implementations, since its processes maintain infinite state. We thus establish a refinement between the abstract protocol and the concrete SCP that uses only finite state, thereby carrying over the result about the correctness of former to the latter. Our results help establish the theoretical foundations of decentralised blockchains like Stellar and gain confidence in their correctness.",

    "abstract": "The Lightning Network is a so-called second-layer technology built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to provide \"off-chain\" fast payment channels between users, which means that not all transactions are settled and stored on the main blockchain. In this paper, we model the emergence of the Lightning Network as a (bond) percolation process and we explore how the distributional properties of the volume and size of transactions per user may impact its feasibility. The agents are all able to reciprocally transfer Bitcoins using the main blockchain and also - if economically convenient - to open a channel on the Lightning Network and transact \"off chain\". We base our approach on fitness-dependent network models: as in real life, a Lightning channel is opened with a probability that depends on the \"fitness\" of the concurring nodes, which in turn depends on wealth and volume of transactions. The emergence of a connected component is studied numerically and analytically as a function of the parameters, and the phase transition separating regions in the phase space where the Lightning Network is sustainable or not is elucidated. We characterize the phase diagram determining the minimal volume of transactions that would make the Lightning Network sustainable for a given level of fees or, alternatively, the maximal cost the Lightning ecosystem may impose for a given average volume of transactions. The model includes parameters that could be in principle estimated from publicly available data once the evolution of the Lighting Network will have reached a stationary operable state, and is fairly robust against different choices of the distributions of parameters and fitness kernels.",

    "abstract": "While sharing files in a peer-to-peer (P2P) system significantly increases both the speed of retrieving the contents and the robustness of the system, tracing the access of files is not straightforward, even in the case of private P2P networks. In fact, a participant that has uploaded a file to a P2P network is not necessarily involved in its download. Additionally, due to the nature of the P2P network it is possible for a participant to already have all the fragments of a file, even before requesting it. This work tries to address the problem of tracing file access in a private P2P file sharing network through the use of blockchains to improve quality of service and auditability. To this end, the proposed solution combines three elements: (1) A distributed hash table network that is used to distribute encrypted files with redundancy amongst the partner peers; (2) Shamir's secret sharing scheme to split the secret keys of each file; (3) A blockchain network to distribute and manage the secret shares amongst the partner peers. In fact, the latter makes access to a file undeniable to every node of the network. The solution is relevant for consortia that manage a shared data pool on base of P2P technology with unrestricted access to files but where access to a file has to be recorded due to legal or billing reasons.",

One of the most important challenges in the insurance industry is to address liability challenge and the forging of documents by the involved parties, i.e., insurance company or the users, in order to increase financial gain. Conventional methods to address this challenge is significantly time consuming and costly and also suffers from lock of transparency. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for the insurance industry in smart cities (BIS). BIS creates a big umbrella that consists of the smart city managers, insurance companies, users, and sensors and devices. The users are known by changeable Public Keys (PKs) that introduces a level of anonymity. The data collected by the sensors is stored in cloud or local storage and is shared with insurance company on demand to find the liable party that in turn increases the privacy of the users. BIS enables the users to prove and share the history of their insurances with other users or insurances. Using Proof of Concept (POC) implementation we demonstrated the applicability of blockchain in insurance industry. The implementation results prove that BIS significantly reduces delay involved in insurance industry as compared with conventional insurance methods.",

However, many bugs and vulnerabilities have been identified in many contracts which raises serious concerns about smart contract security, not to mention that the blockchain systems on which the smart contracts are built can be buggy. Thus, there is a significant need to better maintain smart contract code and ensure its high reliability. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to learn characteristics of smart contracts in Solidity, which is useful for clone detection, bug detection and contract validation on smart contracts. Our new approach is based on word embeddings and vector space comparison. We parse smart contract code into word streams with code structural information, convert code elements (e.g., statements, functions) into numerical vectors that are supposed to encode the code syntax and semantics, and compare the similarities among the vectors encoding code and known bugs, to identify potential issues. We have implemented the approach in a prototype, named SmartEmbed. Results show that our tool can effectively identify many repetitive instances of Solidity code, where the clone ratio is around 90\\%. Code clones such as type-III or even type-IV semantic clones can also be detected accurately. Our tool can identify more than 1000 clone related bugs based on our bug databases efficiently and accurately. Our tool can also help to efficiently validate any given smart contract against a known set of bugs, which can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of the contract.

Network Slicing is envisioned to open up the telecom market to new players such as Industry Verticals, e.g. automotive, smart factories, e-health, etc. Given the large number of potential new business players, dubbed as network tenants, novel solutions are required to accommodate their needs in a cost-efficient and secure manner.

Current practices are deployed on cloud-based centralized data centers, which increase maintenance costs, require massive storage space, and raise privacy concerns about sharing information over a network. Therefore, it is important to design a framework to enable sharing and storing of big medical data efficiently within a trustless environment. In the present paper, we propose a novel proof-of-concept design for a distributed patient-centric image management (PCIM) system that is aimed to ensure safety and control of patient private data without using a centralized infrastructure. In this system, we employed an emerging Ethereum blockchain and a distributed file system technology called InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Then, we implemented an Ethereum smart contract called the patientcentric access control protocol to enable a distributed and trustworthy access control policy. IPFS provides the means for decentralized storage of medical images with global accessibility. We describe how the PCIM system architecture facilitates the distributed and secured patient-centric data access across multiple entities such as hospitals, patients, and image requestors. Finally, we deployed a smart contract prototype on an Ethereum testnet blockchain and evaluated the proposed framework within the Windows environment. The evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed scheme is efficient and feasible.",

First, it generates electricity by use of gas, and then exploits the waste heat to supply community with heat and cooling. In this paper, we consider a smart city consisting of a number of communities (CCHPs) and an agent of power grid (APG), where CCHPs can sell energy to the APG according to its bid. To study all utilities of entities in such a city from energy trading, a noncooperative Stackelberg game between APG and CCHPs is formulated. Here, the APG gives a bid for buying the energy from CCHPs, then CCHPs respond to the APG with their optimal energy supply that maximizing their utilities according to this bid. We show that the maximum profit to the APG and utilities to the CCHPs can be obtained at the Stackelberg equilibrium, which is guaranteed to exist and unique. Because the complete information about energy supply of each CCHP is unknown to the APG in advance, we propose a distributed algorithm that is able to find the point of equilibrium through a limited number of iterations. Taking privacy protection and transaction security into consideration, we design a blockchain-enabled energy management system. This system is composed of Internet of Energy (IoE) sub-system and blockchain sub-system, where the information interactions as well as energy transactions between APG and CCHPs can be carried out effectively and safely.

AxeChain achieves this by coupling hard problem solving with PoW mining. We model the security of AxeChain and derive a balance curve between power utilization and system security. That is, under the reasonable assumption that the attack power does not exceed 1/3 of the total power, 1/2 of total power can be safely used to solve practical problems. We also design a novel incentive model based on the amount of work involved in problem solving, balancing the interests of both the users and miners. Moreover, our experimental results show that AxeChain provides strong security guarantees, no matter what kind of problem is submitted.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain systems often employ proof-of-work consensus protocols to validate and add transactions into hashchains. These protocols stimulate competition among miners in solving cryptopuzzles (e.g. SHA-256 hash computation in Bitcoin) in exchange for a monetary reward. Here, we model mining as an all-pay auction, where miners' computational efforts are interpreted as bids, and the allocation function is the probability of solving the cryptopuzzle in a single attempt with unit (normalized) computational capability. Such an allocation function captures how blockchain systems control the difficulty of the cryptopuzzle as a function of miners' computational abilities (bids). In an attempt to reduce mining costs, we investigate designing a mining auction mechanism which induces a logit equilibrium amongst the miners with choice distributions that are unilaterally decreasing with costs at each miner. We show it is impossible to design a lenient allocation function that does this. Specifically, we show that there exists no allocation function that discourages miners to bid higher costs at logit equilibrium, if the rate of change of difficulty with respect to each miner's cost is bounded by the inverse of the sum of costs at all the miners.",

To realize DSN as a usable service in a truly decentralized manner, the blockchain comes in handy -- to record and verify audit trails in forms of proof of storage, and based on that, to handle fair payments with necessary dispute resolution. Leaving the audit trails on the blockchain offers transparency and fairness, yet it 1) sacrifices privacy, as they may leak information about the data under audit, and 2) overwhelms on-chain resources, as they may be practically large in size and expensive to verify. Prior auditing designs in centralized settings are not directly applicable here. A handful of proposals targeting DSN cannot satisfactorily address these issues either. We present an auditing solution that addresses on-chain privacy and efficiency, from a synergy of homomorphic linear authenticators with polynomial commitments for succinct proofs, and the sigma protocol for provable privacy. The solution results in, per audit, 288-byte proof written to the blockchain, and constant verification cost. It can sustain long-term operation and easily scale to thousands of users on Ethereum.",

    "abstract": "Ethereum has emerged as the most popular smart contract development platform, with hundreds of thousands of contracts stored on the blockchain and covering a variety of application scenarios, such as auctions, trading platforms, and so on. Given their financial nature, security vulnerabilities may lead to catastrophic consequences and, even worse, they can be hardly fixed as data stored on the blockchain, including the smart contract code itself, are immutable. An automated security analysis of these contracts is thus of utmost interest, but at the same time technically challenging for a variety of reasons, such as the specific transaction-oriented programming mechanisms, which feature a subtle semantics, and the fact that the blockchain data which the contract under analysis interacts with, including the code of callers and callees, are not statically known. In this work, we present eThor, the first sound and automated static analyzer for EVM bytecode, which is based on an abstraction of the EVM bytecode semantics based on Horn clauses. In particular, our static analysis supports reachability properties, which we show to be sufficient for capturing interesting security properties for smart contracts (e.g., single-entrancy) as well as contract-specific functional properties. Our analysis is proven sound against a complete semantics of EVM bytecode and an experimental large-scale evaluation on real-world contracts demonstrates that eThor is practical and outperforms the state-of-the-art static analyzers: specifically, eThor is the only one to provide soundness guarantees, terminates on 95% of a representative set of real-world contracts, and achieves an F-measure (which combines sensitivity and specificity) of 89%.",

In this paper, we present VerifyMed -- the first proof-of-concept platform, built on Ethereum, for transparently validating the authorization and competence of medical professionals using blockchain technology. Our platform models trust relationships within the healthcare industry to validate professional clinical authorization. Furthermore, it enables a healthcare professional to build a portfolio of real-life work experience and further validates the competence by storing outcome metrics reported by the patients.

    "abstract": "Difficulty algorithms are a fundamental component of Proof-of-Work blockchains, aimed at maintaining stable block production times by dynamically adjusting the network difficulty in response to the miners' constantly changing computational power. Targeting stable block times is critical, as this ensures consistent transaction throughput. Some blockchains need difficulty algorithms that react quickly to severe hash rate fluctuations. However, without careful design this could create vulnerabilities that incentivize miners to engage in coin-hopping strategies which yield an unreliable system due to unstable processing of transactions. We provide an empirical analysis of how Bitcoin Cash exhibits cyclicality in block solve times as a consequence of a positive feedback loop in its difficulty algorithm design. Additionally, we examine the extent to which miners' behavior contributes towards this phenomenon over time. In response, we mathematically derive a difficulty algorithm based on a negative exponential filter that prohibits the formation of positive feedback loops and exhibits additional desirable properties, such as history agnosticism. We compare the described algorithm to that of Bitcoin Cash in a simulated mining environment and verify that the former would eliminate the severe oscillations in block solve times. Lastly, we outline how this model can more generally replace difficulty algorithms in other Proof-of-Work blockchains.",

Besides Bitcoin, thousands of cryptocurrencies have been distributed on blockchains, while hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges are emerging to facilitate the trading of digital assets. At the same time, it also attracts the attentions of attackers. Fake deposit, as one of the most representative attacks (vulnerabilities) related to exchanges and tokens, has been frequently observed in the blockchain ecosystem, causing large financial losses. However, besides a few security reports, our community lacks of the understanding of this vulnerability, for example its scale and the impacts. In this paper, we take the first step to demystify the fake deposit vulnerability. Based on the essential patterns we have summarized, we implement DEPOSafe, an automated tool to detect and verify (exploit) the fake deposit vulnerability in ERC-20 smart contracts. DEPOSafe incorporates several key techniques including symbolic execution based static analysis and behavior modeling based dynamic verification. By applying DEPOSafe to 176,000 ERC-20 smart contracts, we have identified over 7,000 vulnerable contracts that may suffer from two types of attacks. Our findings demonstrate the urgency to identify and prevent the fake deposit vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain protocols differ in fundamental ways, including the mechanics of selecting users to produce blocks (e.g., proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake) and the method to establish consensus (e.g., longest chain rules vs. BFT-inspired protocols). These fundamental differences have hindered \"apples-to-apples\" comparisons between different categories of blockchain protocols and, in turn, the development of theory to formally discuss their relative merits. This paper presents a parsimonious abstraction sufficient for capturing and comparing properties of many well-known permissionless blockchain protocols, simultaneously capturing essential properties of both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake protocols, and of both longest-chain-type and BFT-type protocols. Our framework blackboxes the precise mechanics of the user selection process, allowing us to isolate the properties of the selection process which are significant for protocol design. We illustrate our framework's utility with two results. First, we prove an analog of the CAP theorem from distributed computing for our framework in a partially synchronous setting. This theorem shows that a fundamental dichotomy holds between protocols (such as Bitcoin) that are adaptive, in the sense that they can function given unpredictable levels of participation, and protocols (such as Algorand) that have certain finality properties. Second, we formalize the idea that proof-of-work (PoW) protocols and non-PoW protocols can be distinguished by the forms of permission that users are given to carry out updates to the state.",

The attention from both public and policy keeps raising on related practical problems, including \\textit{1) how to protect data security and location privacy? 2) how to efficiently and dynamically deploy SRC Internet of Thing (IoT) witnesses to monitor large areas?} To answer these questions, in this paper, we propose a decentralized and permissionless blockchain protocol, named \\textit{Bychain}. Specifically, 1) a privacy-preserving SRC protocol for activity-tracking and corresponding generalized block structure is developed, by connecting an interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol and the key escrow mechanism. As a result, connections between personal identity and the ownership of on-chain location information are decoupled. Meanwhile, the owner of the on-chain location data can still claim its ownership without revealing the private key to anyone else. 2) An artificial potential field-based incentive allocation mechanism is proposed to incentivize IoT witnesses to pursue the maximum monitoring coverage deployment. We implemented and evaluated the proposed blockchain protocol in the real-world using the Bluetooth 5.0. The storage, CPU utilization, power consumption, time delay, and security of each procedure and performance of activities are analyzed. The experiment and security analysis is shown to provide a real-world performance evaluation.",

The first is to evaluate the suitability of the idea of building a trusted achievement record for learners in higher education, and to evaluate potential user knowledge of blockchain technology. This is to ensure that a designed system is usable. The second aim includes an interview conducted with a small group of participants to gather information about the challenges individuals have when creating, and reviewing CVs. Overall, 90% of participants agreed that there was a strong need for a trusted achievement record. In addition, 93.64% of respondents stated that they felt it was invaluable to have a system that is usable by all stakeholders. When tackling the second aim it was found that a primary challenge is lack of knowledge of blockchain and its complexity. From the employers' perspective, there is a lack of trust due to inaccuracies when students describe skills and qualifications in their resumes.",

    "abstract": "A proof of work (PoW) blockchain protocol distributes rewards to its participants, called miners, according to their share of the total computational power. Sufficiently large miners can perform selfish mining - deviate from the protocol to gain more than their fair share. Such systems are thus secure if all miners are smaller than a threshold size so their best response is following the protocol. To find the threshold, one has to identify the optimal strategy for miners of different sizes, i.e., solve a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, because of the PoW difficulty adjustment mechanism, the miners' utility is a non-linear ratio function. We therefore call this an Average Reward Ratio (ARR) MDP. Sapirshtein et al.\\ were the first to solve ARR MDPs by solving a series of standard MDPs that converge to the ARR MDP solution. In this work, we present a novel technique for solving an ARR MDP by solving a single standard MDP. The crux of our approach is to augment the MDP such that it terminates randomly, within an expected number of rounds. We call this Probabilistic Termination Optimization (PTO), and the technique applies to any MDP whose utility is a ratio function. We bound the approximation error of PTO - it is inversely proportional to the expected number of rounds before termination, a parameter that we control. Empirically, PTO's complexity is an order of magnitude lower than the state of the art. PTO can be easily applied to different blockchains. We use it to tighten the bound on the threshold for selfish mining in Ethereum.",

However, many identified bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have led to serious financial losses, which raises serious concerns about smart contract security. Thus, there is a significant need to better maintain smart contract code and ensure its high reliability. In this research: (1) Firstly, we propose an automated deep learning based approach to learn structural code embeddings of smart contracts in Solidity, which is useful for clone detection, bug detection and contract validation on smart contracts. We apply our approach to more than 22K solidity contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain, results show that the clone ratio of solidity code is at around 90%, much higher than traditional software. We collect a list of 52 known buggy smart contracts belonging to 10 kinds of common vulnerabilities as our bug database. Our approach can identify more than 1000 clone related bugs based on our bug databases efficiently and accurately. (2) Secondly, according to developers' feedback, we have implemented the approach in a web-based tool, named SmartEmbed, to facilitate Solidity developers for using our approach. Our tool can assist Solidity developers to efficiently identify repetitive smart contracts in the existing Ethereum blockchain, as well as checking their contract against a known set of bugs, which can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of the contract. We optimize the implementations of SmartEmbed which is sufficient in supporting developers in real-time for practical uses. The Ethereum ecosystem as well as the individual Solidity developer can both benefit from our research.",

Prior research in blockchain security identified financially incentivized attacks based on withholding blocks which have the attacker compromise a victim pool and pose as a PoW contributor by submitting the shares (earning credit for mining) but withholding the blocks (no actual contributions to the pool). We advance such threats to generate greater reward advantage to the attackers while undermining the other miners and introduce the share withholding attack (SWH). SWH withholds shares to increase the attacker's reward payout within the pool, in contrast to the prior threats withholding blocks, and rather builds on the block-withholding threats in order to exploit the information about the impending block submission timing, challenging the popularly established assumption that the block submission time is completely random and unknown to miners. We analyze SWH's incentive compatibility and the vulnerability scope by identifying the critical systems and environmental parameters which determine the attack's impact. Our results show that SWH in conjunction with block withholding yield unfair reward advantage at the expense of the protocol-complying victim miners and that a rational miner will selfishly launch SWH to maximize its reward profit. We inform the blockchain and cryptocurrency research of the novel SWH threat and include the potential countermeasure directions to facilitate such research and development.",

In this paper, to fill the gap, we first collect as many smart contract bugs as possible from multiple sources and divide these bugs into 9 categories by extending the IEEE Standard Classification for Software Anomalies. Then, we design the criteria for detecting each kind of bugs, and construct a dataset of smart contracts covering all kinds of bugs. With our framework and dataset, developers can learn smart contract bugs and develop new tools to detect and locate bugs in smart contracts. Moreover, we evaluate the state-of-the-art tools for smart contract analysis with our dataset and obtain some interesting findings: 1) Mythril, Slither and Remix are the most worthwhile combination of analysis tools. 2) There are still 10 kinds of bugs that cannot be detected by any analysis tool.",

This paper proposes a novel suite of protocols called NF-Crowd that resolves the scalability issue by reducing the lower bound of the total cost of a decentralized crowdsourcing project to O(1). NF-Crowd is a highly reliable solution for scaling decentralized crowdsourcing. We prove that as long as participants of a project powered by NF-Crowd are rational, the O(1) lower bound of cost could be reached regardless of the scale of the crowd. We also demonstrate that as long as at least one participant of a project powered by NF-Crowd is honest, the project cannot be aborted and the results are guaranteed to be correct. We design NF-Crowd protocols for a representative type of project named crowdsourcing contest with open community review (CC-OCR). We implement the protocols over the Ethereum official test network. Our results demonstrate that NF-Crowd protocols can reduce the cost of running a CC-OCR project to less than $2 regardless of the scale of the crowd, providing a significant cost benefit in adopting decentralized crowdsourcing solutions.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are Turing-complete programs running on the blockchain. They are immutable and cannot be modified, even when bugs are detected. Therefore, ensuring smart contracts are bug-free and well-designed before deploying them to the blockchain is extremely important. A contract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Detecting and removing contract defects can avoid potential bugs and make programs more robust. Our previous work defined 20 contract defects for smart contracts and divided them into five impact levels. According to our classification, contract defects with seriousness level between 1-3 can lead to unwanted behaviors, e.g., a contract being controlled by attackers. In this paper, we propose DefectChecker, a symbolic execution-based approach and tool to detect eight contract defects that can cause unwanted behaviors of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain platform. DefectChecker can detect contract defects from smart contracts bytecode. We compare DefectChecker with key previous works, including Oyente, Mythril and Securify by using an open-source dataset. Our experimental results show that DefectChecker performs much better than these tools in terms of both speed and accuracy. We also applied DefectChecker to 165,621 distinct smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. We found that 25,815 of these smart contracts contain at least one of the contract defects that belongs to impact level 1-3, including some real-world attacks.",

    "abstract": "During the Coincheck incident, which recorded the largest damages in cryptocurrency history in 2018, it was demonstrated that using Mosaic token can have a certain effect. Although it seems attractive to employ tokens as countermeasures for cryptocurrency leakage, Mosaic is a specific token for the New Economy Movement (NEM) cryptocurrency and is not employed for other blockchain systems or cryptocurrencies. Moreover, although some volunteers tracked leaked NEM using Mosaic in the CoinCheck incident, it would be better to verify that the volunteers can be trusted. Simultaneously, if someone (e.g., who stole cryptocurrencies) can identify the volunteers, then that person or organization may be targets of them. In this paper, we propose an anonymous trust-marking scheme on blockchain systems that is universally applicable to any cryptocurrency. In our scheme, entities called token admitters are allowed to generate tokens adding trustworthiness or untrustworthiness to addresses. Anyone can anonymously verify whether these tokens were issued by a token admitter. Simultaneously, only the designated auditor and no one else, including nondesignated auditors, can identify the token admitters. Our scheme is based on accountable ring signatures and commitment, and is implemented on an elliptic curve called Curve25519, and we confirm that both cryptographic tools are efficient. Moreover, we also confirm that our scheme is applicable to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NEM.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that users on open blockchains are tracked by an industry providing services to governments, law enforcement, secret services, and alike. While most blockchains do not protect their users' privacy and allow external observers to link transactions and addresses, a growing research interest attempts to design add-on privacy solutions to help users regain their privacy on non-private blockchains. In this work, we propose to our knowledge the first censorship resilient mixer, which can reward its users in a privacy-preserving manner for participating in the system. Increasing the anonymity set size, and diversity of users, is, as we believe, an important endeavor to raise a mixer's contributed privacy in practice. The paid out rewards can take the form of governance token to decentralize the voting on system parameters, similar to how popular \"DeFi farming\" protocols operate. Our system $\\mathsf{AMR}$ is autonomous as it does not rely on any external server or third party. The evaluation of our $\\mathsf{AMR}$ implementation shows that the system supports today on Ethereum anonymity set sizes beyond thousands of users, and a capacity of over $66,000$ deposits per day, at constant system costs. We provide a formal specification of our zkSnark-based $\\mathsf{AMR}$ system, a privacy and security analysis, implementation, and evaluation with both the MiMC and Poseidon hash functions.

    "abstract": "Electric vehicle (EV) is becoming more and more popular in our daily life, which replaces the traditional fuel vehicles to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment. The EVs need to be charged, but the number of charging piles in a charging station (CS) is limited and charging is usually more time-consuming than fueling. According to this scenario, we propose a secure and efficient charging scheduling system based on DAG-blockchain and double auction mechanism. In a smart area, it attempts to assign EVs to the available CSs in the light of their submitted charging requests and status information. First, we design a lightweight charging scheduling framework that integrates DAG-blockchain and modern cryptography technology to ensure security and scalability during performing scheduling and completing tradings. In this process, a constrained double auction problem is formulated because of the limited charging resources in a CS, which motivates the EVs and CSs in this area to participate in the market based on their preferences and statuses. Due to this constraint, our problem is more complicated and harder to achieve the truthfulness as well as system efficiency compared to the existing double auction model. To adapt to it, we propose two algorithms, namely the truthful mechanism for charging (TMC) and efficient mechanism for charging (EMC), to determine the assignments between EVs and CSs and pricing strategies. Then, both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Hyperledger Fabric is a prominent and flexible solution for building permissioned distributed ledger platforms. Access control and identity management relies on a Membership Service Provider (MSP) whose cryptographic interface only handles standard PKI methods for authentication: RSA and ECDSA classical signatures. Also, MSP-issued credentials may use only one signature scheme, tying the credential-related functions to classical single-signature primitives. RSA and ECDSA are vulnerable to quantum attacks, with an ongoing post-quantum standardization process to identify quantum-safe drop-in replacements. In this paper, we propose a redesign of Fabric's credential-management procedures and related specifications in order to incorporate hybrid digital signatures, protecting against both classical and quantum attacks using one classical and one quantum-safe signature. We create PQFabric, an implementation of Fabric with hybrid signatures that integrates with the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) library. Our implementation offers complete crypto-agility, with the ability to perform live migration to a hybrid quantum-safe blockchain and select any existing OQS signature algorithm for each node. We perform comparative benchmarks of PQFabric with each of the NIST candidates and alternates, revealing that long public keys and signatures lead to an increase in hashing time that is sometimes comparable to the time spent signing or verifying messages itself. This is a new and potentially significant issue in the migration of blockchains to post-quantum signatures.",

As a result, current research and development in this field is focused mainly on smart contract applications that use on-chain smart contracts. We argue that there is a large class of smart contract applications where on-TTP smart contracts are a better alternative. The problem with on-chain smart contracts is that the fully decentralised model and indelible append-only data model followed by blockchains introduces several engineering problems that are hard to solve. In these situations, the inclusion of a TTP (assuming that the application can tolerate its inconveniences) instead of a blockchain to host the smart contract simplifies the problems and offers pragmatic solutions. The intention and contribution of this paper is to shed some light on this issue. We use a hypothetical use case of a car insurance application to illustrate technical problems that are easier to solve with on-TTP smart contracts than with on-chain smart contracts.",

However, the safety of riders and drivers has become of paramount concern and a method for privacy-preserving identity verification between untrusted parties is essential for protecting users. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving identity verification system, extending zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) and blockchain for use in ridesharing applications. We design a permissioned blockchain network to perform the ZKP verification of a driver's identity, which also acts as an immutable ledger to store ride logs and ZKP records. For the ZKP module, we design a protocol to facilitate user verification without requiring the exchange of any private information. We prototype the proposed system on the Hyperledger Fabric platform, with the Hyperledger Ursa cryptography library, and conduct extensive experimentation. To measure the prototype's performance, we utilize the Hyperledger Caliper benchmark tool to perform extensive analysis and the results show that our system is suitable for use in real-world ridesharing applications.",

This research focuses on a use case with respect to the real time Internet of Things (IoT) network which is deployed at the beach of Chicago Park District. This real time data which is collected from various sensors is then used to design a predictive model using Deep Neural Networks for estimating the battery life of IoT sensors that is deployed at the beach. This proposed model could help the government to plan for placing orders of replaceable batteries before time so that there can be an uninterrupted service. Since this data is sensitive and requires to be secured, the predicted battery life value is stored in blockchain which would be a tamper-proof record of the data.",

However, the development of secure IoT solutions is getting a long way lagged behind, making us exposed to common unauthorized accesses that may bring malicious attacks and unprecedented danger to our daily life. Overprivilege attack, a widely reported phenomenon in IoT that accesses unauthorized or excessive resources, is notoriously hard to prevent, trace and mitigate. To tackle this challenge, we propose Tokoin-Based Access Control (TBAC), an accountable access control model enabled by blockchain and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technologies, to offer fine-graininess, strong auditability, and access procedure control for IoT. TBAC materializes the virtual access power into a definite-amount and secure cryptographic coin termed \"tokoin\" (token+coin), and manages it using atomic and accountable state-transition functions in a blockchain. We also realize access procedure control by mandating every tokoin a fine-grained access policy defining who is allowed to do what at when in where by how. The tokoin is peer-to-peer transferable, and can be modified only by the resource owner when necessary. We fully implement TBAC with well-studied cryptographic primitives and blockchain platforms and present a readily available APP for regular users. We also present a case study to demonstrate how TBAC is employed to enable autonomous in-home cargo delivery while guaranteeing the access policy compliance and home owner's physical security by regulating the physical behaviors of the deliveryman.",

Accordingly, security between such tags and readers have primarily been studied among many issues of RFID. However, the authenticity of data cannot be guaranteed if logistics services can give false information. Although the use of blockchain is often discussed, it is simply a recording system, so there is a risk that false records may be written to it. As a solution, we propose a design in which a digitally signing, location-constrained and tamper-evident reader atomically writes an evidence to blockchain along with its reading and writing a tag. By semi-formal modeling, we confirmed that the confidentiality and integrity of the information can be maintained throughout the system, and digitally signed data can be verified later despite possible compromise of private keys or signature algorithms, or expiration of public key certificates. We also introduce a prototype design to show that our proposal is viable. This makes it possible to trace authentic logistics information using inexpensive passive RFID tags. Furthermore, by abstracting the reader/writer as a sensor/actuator, this model can be extended to IoT in general.",

In this paper, we mainly concentrate on enforcing access control on users to ensure platform security. First, we leverage access proxy integrated with attribute-based access control (ABAC) model to implement front-end authorization, which can fully reflect and cope with the flexible nature of the complex access control process in Hadoop platform, as well as can release back-end resources from complex authorization process through access proxy. Moreover, in order to ensure the fine-granularity of authorization, the access proxy maintains a list composed of trust threshold value provided by each resource according to its importance. The access proxy interacts with the blockchain network to obtain the user's trust evaluation value, which serves as an important basis for dynamic authorization determination. More specifically, blockchain network works together on-chain and off-chain modes. The user's historical behavior data is stored off-chain, and the corresponding hash value is anchored on-chain. Consequently, the user's trust value is evaluated based on his historical behavior stored on the blockchain platform. Meanwhile, the authenticity of user behavior data can be guaranteed, thereby ensuring the reliability of trust assessment results. Our experiment demonstrates that the proposed model can dynamically and flexibly adjust user permissions to ensure the security of the platform, while time and money are consumed within a reasonable range.",

FL shows an inherent advantage in privacy preservation, since users' raw data are processed locally. However, it relies on a centralized server to perform model aggregation. Therefore, FL is vulnerable to server malfunctions and external attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework by integrating blockchain into FL, namely, blockchain assisted decentralized federated learning (BLADE-FL), to enhance the security of FL. The proposed BLADE-FL has a good performance in terms of privacy preservation, tamper resistance, and effective cooperation of learning. However, it gives rise to a new problem of training deficiency, caused by lazy clients who plagiarize others' trained models and add artificial noises to conceal their cheating behaviors. To be specific, we first develop a convergence bound of the loss function with the presence of lazy clients and prove that it is convex with respect to the total number of generated blocks $K$. Then, we solve the convex problem by optimizing $K$ to minimize the loss function. Furthermore, we discover the relationship between the optimal $K$, the number of lazy clients, and the power of artificial noises used by lazy clients. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework using the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our analytical results are shown to be consistent with the experimental results. In addition, the derived optimal $K$ achieves the minimum value of loss function, and in turn the optimal accuracy performance.",

    "abstract": "A key component of security in decentralized blockchains is proof of opportunity cost among block producers. In the case of proof-of-work (PoW), currently used by the most prominent systems, the cost is due to spent computation. In this paper, we characterize the security investment of miners in terms of its cost in fiat money. This enables comparison of security allocations across PoW blockchains that generally use different PoW algorithms and reward miners in different cryptocurrency units. We prove that there exists a unique allocation equilibrium, depending on market prices only, that is achieved by both strategic miners (who contemplate the actions of others) and by miners seeking only short-term profit. In fact, the latter will unknowingly compensate for any attempt to deliberately shift security allocation away from equilibrium. Our conclusions are supported analytically through the development of a Markov decision process, game theoretical analysis, and derivation of no arbitrage conditions. We corroborate those results with empirical evidence from more than two years of blockchain and price data. Overall agreement is strong. We show that between January 1, 2018 and August 1, 2020, market prices predicted security allocation between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash with error less than 0.6%. And from the beginning of October 2019, until August 1, 2020, market prices predicted security allocation between Bitcoin and Litecoin with error of 0.45%. These results are further corroborated by our establishment of Granger-causality between change in market prices and change in security allocation. To demonstrate the practicality of our results, we describe a trustless oracle that leverages the equilibrium to estimate the price ratios of PoW cryptocurrencies from on-chain information only.",

However, these lightweight nodes usually do not have enough computing power to complete the consensus or other computing-required tasks. Edge computing network gives a platform to provide computing power to IoT devices. A fundamental problem is how to allocate limited edge servers to IoT devices in a highly untrustworthy environment. In a fair competition environment, the allocation mechanism should be online, truthful, and privacy safe. To address these three challenges, we propose an online multi-item double auction (MIDA) mechanism, where IoT devices are buyers and edge servers are sellers. In order to achieve the truthfulness, the participants' private information is at risk of being exposed by inference attack, which may lead to malicious manipulation of the market by adversaries. Then, we improve our MIDA mechanism based on differential privacy to protect sensitive information from being leaked. It interferes with the auction results slightly but guarantees privacy protection with high confidence. Besides, we upgrade our privacy-preserving MIDA mechanism such that adapting to more complex and realistic scenarios.

Regardless of their intended application, blockchain platforms implicitly assume consensus for the correct execution of a smart contract, thus requiring that all transactions are totally ordered. It was only recently recognized that consensus is not necessary to prevent double-spending in a cryptocurrency (Guerraoui et al., PODC'19), contrary to common belief. This result suggests that current implementations may be sacrificing efficiency and scalability because they synchronize transactions much more tightly than actually needed. In this work, we study the synchronization requirements of Ethereum's ERC20 token contract, one of the most widely adopted smart contacts. Namely, we model a smart-contract token as a concurrent object and analyze its consensus number as a measure of synchronization power. We show that the richer set of methods supported by ERC20 tokens, compared to standard cryptocurrencies, results in strictly stronger synchronization requirements. More surprisingly, the synchronization power of ERC20 tokens depends on the object's state and can thus be modified by method invocations. To prove this result, we develop a dedicated framework to express how the object's state affects the needed synchronization level. Our findings indicate that ERC20 tokens, as well as other token standards, are more powerful and versatile than plain cryptocurrencies, and are subject to dynamic requirements. Developing specific synchronization protocols that exploit these dynamic requirements will pave the way towards more robust and scalable blockchain platforms.",

    "abstract": "Society is in constant transition to keep up with technological advancement, we are seeing traditional paradigms being increasingly challenged. The fundamentals of governance are one such paradigm. As society's values have shifted, so have expectations of government shifted from the traditional model to something commonly referred to as 'open governance'. Though a disputed term, we take open governance to mean a concept, which encourages and facilitates openness, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens. For the success of open governance initiatives, there are some technologies, such as the internet, that are crucial. These technologies enable access to both the data and to engagement activities between citizens and government. There are also other technologies, like blockchain and smart contacts, which could be utilised to assist open governance. A sound starting point would be moving from a system where information is tediously released by a government, on an 'as they please' basis, to an infrastructure where critical actions are captured with strong integrity, non-repudiation and evidential guarantees. With an added dimension that facilitates these actions record be accessible to public scrutiny in near real-time. One candidate technology for capturing such actions is blockchain. The blockchains utility is being recognised through smart contracts - potentially a vital building block to realising open and transparent government activities. In this paper, we employ the concept of smart contracts to government tendering activities. The proposed scheme is based on smart contracts, enabling a fair, transparent and independently verifiable (auditable) government tendering scheme. The scheme is then implemented on the Ethereum platform to evaluate the performance and financial cost implications, along with an evaluation of the potential security and auditability challenges.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of decentralized book systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum has always been a challenge. It is usually measured by three major factors: scalability, throughput, and latency. Scalability refers to how the system capacity is increased by adding more physical resources. Throughput measures the volume of transactions for a given period of time, where most current solutions attempt to improve such as NEO, EOS, etc. Latency measures the processing time of any single transaction. In current blockchain based systems, the block generation rate is the main latency bottleneck. Off-chain processes such as state channels are the most recent work that can integrate partial inbound transactions, reducing latency. Unfortunately, the state channel introduces more issues at the same time, such as cross-channel synchronization, which makes the state channel unavailable for full adoption of current blockchain solutions. In order to solve the efficiency problem, we proposed an end-to-end solution called ALZA, which links the dedicated high-throughput blockchain with self-organizing payment fields. This mechanism allows arbitrary set of users to create payment fields that process extremely low latency transactions within each field. Therefore, users can make transactions almost immediately. Since all transactions are conducted within fields, transaction costs will be reduced by several orders of magnitude. In addition, ALZA distributes main ledger to each client through an innovative replication mechanism. Therefore, the system will be significantly more robust to blockchain system failures. In theory, ALZA can complete millions of transactions in one second, which naturally supports high-frequency trading.",

    "abstract": "The current system to manage the global pool of IP addresses is centralized in five transnational organizations, the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). Each of these RIRs manage the address pool for a large number of countries. Because the RIRs are private organizations, they are subject to the legal framework of the country where they are based. This configuration results in a jurisdictional overflow from the legal framework of the countries where the RIR is based to all the countries that the RIRs are serving (the countries served by the RIRs de facto become subjects of the legal system of the country where the RIR is hosted). The situation is aggravated by the deployment of new security techniques such as the RPKI and BGPsec, that enable enforcement of allocations by the RIRs. In this paper we present InBlock, a blockchain-based distributed governance body aimed to provide de-centralized management of IP addresses. InBlock also aims to fulfil the same objectives as the current IP address allocation system, namely, uniqueness, fairness, conservation, aggregation, registration and minimized overhead. InBlock is implemented as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, i.e., as a set of blockchain's smart contracts in Ethereum. Any entity may request an allocation of addresses to the InBlock registry by solely performing a (crypto)currency transfer to the InBlock. The fee required, along with the annual renewal fee, serves as a mechanism to deter stockpiling and other wasteful practices. As with any novel technology, there are many open questions about the usage of blockchains to build an IP address registry. For this reason, we believe that practical experimentation is required in order to have hands-on experiences about such a system. We propose to conduct an experiment on distributed address management using InBlock as a starting point to inform future directions in this area.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and several others execute complex transactions in blocks through user-defined scripts known as smart contracts. To append a correct block into blockchain, miners execute these transactions of smart contracts sequentially. Later the validators serially re-execute the smart contract transactions of the block to validate it. If validation is successful then the block is added to the blockchain using a consensus protocol and miner gets the incentive. In the current era of multi-core processors, by employing the serial execution of the transactions, the miners and validators fail to utilize the cores properly and as a result, have poor throughput. By entitling concurrency to smart contracts execution, we can achieve better efficiency and higher throughput. In this proposal, we develop a novel and efficient technique to execute the smart contract transactions concurrently by miner using optimistic Software Transactional Memory systems (STMs). The miner proposes a block which consists of the set of transactions, conflict graph, hash of previous block and final state of each shared data-objects. Later, we propose concurrent validator which re-executes the same smart contracts concurrently and deterministically with the help of conflict graph given by miner and verifies the final states. On successful validation, proposed block appended into the blockchain and miner gets the incentive. We consider a benchmarks from solidity documentation. We execute the smart contract transactions concurrently using Basic Time stamp Ordering (BTO) and Multi-Version Time stamp Ordering (MVTO) protocols as optimistic STMs. BTO and MVTO miner achieves 3.6x and 3.7x average speedups over serial miner respectively. BTO and MVTO validator outperform average 40.8x and 47.1x than serial validator respectively.",

This prevents such blockchains from running Machine Learning algorithms, Zero-Knowledge proofs, etc. which may need non-trivial computation. In this paper, we present YODA, which is to the best of our knowledge the first solution for efficient computation of CICs in permissionless blockchains with guarantees for a threat model with both Byzantine and selfish nodes. YODA selects one or more execution sets (ES) via Sortition to execute a particular CIC off-chain. One key innovation is the MultI-Round Adaptive Consensus using Likelihood Estimation (MIRACLE) algorithm based on sequential hypothesis testing. M I RACLE allows the execution sets to be small thus making YODA efficient while ensuring correct CIC execution with high probability. It adapts the number of ES sets automatically depending on the concentration of Byzantine nodes in the system and is optimal in terms of the expected number of ES sets used in certain scenarios. Through a suite of economic incentives and technical mechanisms such as the novel Randomness Inserted Contract Execution (RICE) algorithm, we force selfish nodes to behave honestly. We also prove that the honest behavior of selfish nodes is an approximate Nash Equilibrium. We present the system design and details of YODA and prove the security properties of MIRACLE and RICE. Our prototype implementation built on top of Ethereum demonstrates the ability of YODA to run CICs with orders of magnitude higher gas per unit time as well as total gas requirements than Ethereum currently supports. It also demonstrates the low overheads of RICE.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains, and specifically smart contracts, have promised to create fair and transparent trading ecosystems. Unfortunately, we show that this promise has not been met. We document and quantify the widespread and rising deployment of arbitrage bots in blockchain systems, specifically in decentralized exchanges (or \"DEXes\"). Like high-frequency traders on Wall Street, these bots exploit inefficiencies in DEXes, paying high transaction fees and optimizing network latency to frontrun, i.e., anticipate and exploit, ordinary users' DEX trades. We study the breadth of DEX arbitrage bots in a subset of transactions that yield quantifiable revenue to these bots. We also study bots' profit-making strategies, with a focus on blockchain-specific elements. We observe bots engage in what we call priority gas auctions (PGAs), competitively bidding up transaction fees in order to obtain priority ordering, i.e., early block position and execution, for their transactions. PGAs present an interesting and complex new continuous-time, partial-information, game-theoretic model that we formalize and study. We release an interactive web portal, http://frontrun.me/, to provide the community with real-time data on PGAs. We additionally show that high fees paid for priority transaction ordering poses a systemic risk to consensus-layer security. We explain that such fees are just one form of a general phenomenon in DEXes and beyond---what we call miner extractable value (MEV)---that poses concrete, measurable, consensus-layer security risks. We show empirically that MEV poses a realistic threat to Ethereum today. Our work highlights the large, complex risks created by transaction-ordering dependencies in smart contracts and the ways in which traditional forms of financial-market exploitation are adapting to and penetrating blockchain economies.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum execute transactions serially by miners and validators and determine the Proof-of-Work (PoW). Such serial execution is unable to exploit modern multi-core resources efficiently, hence limiting the system throughput and increasing the transaction acceptance latency. The objective of this work is to increase the transaction throughput by introducing parallel transaction execution using a static analysis technique. We propose a framework DiPETransfor the distributed execution of the transactions in a block. Here, peers in the blockchain network form a community to execute the transactions and find the PoW parallelly, using a leader-follower approach. During mining, the leader statically analyzes the transactions, creates different groups (shards) of independent transactions, and distributes them to followers to execute them in parallel. After the transaction executes, the community's compute power is utilized to solve the PoW concurrently. When a block is successfully created, the leader broadcasts the proposed block to other peers in the network for validation. On receiving a block, validators re-execute the block transactions and accept the block if they reach the same state as shared by the miner. Validation can also be done as a community, in parallel, following the same leader-follower approach as mining. We report experiments using over 5 Million real transactions from the Ethereum blockchain and execute them using our DiPETrans framework to empirically validate the benefits of our techniques over traditional sequential execution. We achieve a maximum speedup of 2.2x for the miner and 2.0x for the validator, with 100 to 500 transactions per block. Further, we achieve a peak of 5x end-to-end block creation speedup using a parallel miner over a serial miner when using 6 machines in the community.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms learn from data and use data from databases that are mutable; therefore, the data and the results of machine learning cannot be fully trusted. Also, the machine learning process is often difficult to automate. A unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning has been presented in the literature. It proposed building a trustable machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts on blockchain are used to automate the machine learning process. In the proposed framework, a core machine learning algorithm can have three implementations: server layer implementation, streaming layer implementation, and smart contract implementation. However, there are still open questions. First, the streaming layer usually deploys on edge devices and therefore has limited memory and computing power. How can we run machine learning on the streaming layer? Second, most data that are stored on blockchain are financial transactions, for which fraud detection is often needed. However, in some applications, training data are hard to obtain. Can we build good machine learning models to do fraud detection with limited training data? These questions motivated this paper; which makes two contributions. First, it proposes training a machine learning model on the server layer and saving the model with a special binary data format. Then, the streaming layer can take this blob of binary data as input and score incoming data online. The blob of binary data is very compact and can be deployed on edge devices. Second, the paper presents a new method of synthetic data generation that can enrich the training data set. Experiments show that this synthetic data generation is very effective in applications such as fraud detection in financial data.",

The use of Information Technology tools in obtaining data of people's everyday life from various autonomous data sources allowing unrestricted access to user data has emerged as an important practical issue and has given rise to legal implications. Various innovative models for data sharing and management have privacy and centrality issues. To alleviate these limitations, we have incorporated blockchain in user modeling. In this paper, we constructed a decentralized data sharing architecture with MultiChain blockchain in the travel domain, which is also applicable to other similar domains including education, health, and sports. Businesses that operate in the tourism industries including travel and tour agencies, hotels and resorts, shopping malls are connected to the MultiChain and they share their user profile data via stream in the MultiChain. The paper presents the hotel booking service for an imaginary hotel as one of the enterprise nodes, which collects user profile data with proper validation and will allow users to decide which of their data to be shared thus ensuring user control over their data and the preservation of privacy. The data from the repository is converted into an open data format while sharing via stream in the blockchain so that other enterprise nodes, after receiving the data, can easily convert them and store into their own repositories. The paper presents an evaluation of the performance of the model by measuring the latency and memory consumption with three test scenarios that mostly affect the user experience.

Designing incentive-compatible incentive mechanisms is notoriously challenging, however. As a result, most public blockchains today use incentive mechanisms whose security properties are poorly understood and largely untested. In this work, we propose SquirRL, a framework for using deep reinforcement learning to analyze attacks on blockchain incentive mechanisms. We demonstrate SquirRL's power by first recovering known attacks: (1) the optimal selfish mining attack in Bitcoin [52], and (2) the Nash equilibrium in block withholding attacks [16]. We also use SquirRL to obtain several novel empirical results. First, we discover a counterintuitive flaw in the widely used rushing adversary model when applied to multi-agent Markov games with incomplete information. Second, we demonstrate that the optimal selfish mining strategy identified in [52] is actually not a Nash equilibrium in the multi-agent selfish mining setting. In fact, our results suggest (but do not prove) that when more than two competing agents engage in selfish mining, there is no profitable Nash equilibrium. This is consistent with the lack of observed selfish mining in the wild. Third, we find a novel attack on a simplified version of Ethereum's finalization mechanism, Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG) that allows a strategic agent to amplify her rewards by up to 30%. Notably, [10] show that honest voting is a Nash equilibrium in Casper FFG: our attack shows that when Casper FFG is composed with selfish mining, this is no longer the case. Altogether, our experiments demonstrate SquirRL's flexibility and promise as a framework for studying attack settings that have thus far eluded theoretical and empirical understanding.",

    "abstract": "People have used cloud computing approach to store their data remotely. As auspicious as this approach is, it brings forth many challenges: from data security to time latency issues with data computation as well as delivery to end users. Fog computing has emerged as an extension for cloud computing to bring data processing and storage close to end-users; however, it minimizes the time latency issue but still suffers from data security challenges. For instance, when a fog node providing services to end users is compromised, the users' data security can be violated. Thus, this paper proposes a secure and fine-grained data access control scheme by integrating the CP-ABE algorithm and blockchain concept to prevent fog nodes from violating end users' data security in a situation where a compromised fog node is being ousted. We also classify the fog nodes into fog federations, based on their attributes such as services and locations, to minimize the time latency and communication overhead between fog nodes and cloud server. Further, the exploitation and integration of the blockchain concept and the CP-ABE algorithm enables fog nodes in the same fog federation to perform the authorization process in a distributed manner. In addition, to solve time latency and communication overhead problems, we equip every fog node with an off-chain database to store most frequently accessed data files for specific time, and with an on-chain access control policies table (On-chain Files Tracking Table) which must be protected from being tampered by malicious (rogue) fog nodes. Therefore, blockchain plays a vital role here as it is tamper-proof by nature. We demonstrate our scheme's efficiency and feasibility by designing algorithms and conducting a security analysis. The provided analysis shows that the proposed scheme is efficient and feasible in ousting malicious (rogue) fog nodes.",

    "abstract": "An increasing amount of users' sensitive information is now being collected for analytics purposes. To protect users' privacy, differential privacy has been widely studied in the literature. Specifically, a differentially private algorithm adds noise to the true answer of a query to generate a noisy response. As a result, the information about the dataset leaked by the noisy output is bounded by the privacy parameter. Oftentimes, a dataset needs to be used for answering multiple queries (e.g., for multiple analytics tasks), so the level of privacy protection may degrade as more queries are answered. Thus, it is crucial to keep track of the privacy spending which should not exceed the given privacy budget. Moreover, if a query has been answered before and is asked again on the same dataset, we may reuse the previous noisy response for the current query to save the privacy cost. In view of the above, we design and implement a blockchain-based system for tracking and saving differential-privacy cost. Blockchain provides a distributed immutable ledger that records each query's type, the noisy response used to answer each query, the associated noise level added to the true query result, and the remaining privacy budget in our system. Furthermore, since the blockchain records the noisy response used to answer each query, we also design an algorithm to reuse previous noisy response if the same query is asked repeatedly. Specifically, considering that different requests of the same query may have different privacy requirements, our algorithm (via a rigorous proof) is able to set the optimal reuse fraction of the old noisy response and add new noise (if necessary) to minimize the accumulated privacy cost. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the privacy cost significantly without compromising data accuracy.",

    "abstract": "With the increase of COVID-19 cases worldwide, an effective way is required to diagnose COVID-19 patients. The primary problem in diagnosing COVID-19 patients is the shortage and reliability of testing kits, due to the quick spread of the virus, medical practitioners are facing difficulty identifying the positive cases. The second real-world problem is to share the data among the hospitals globally while keeping in view the privacy concerns of the organizations. Building a collaborative model and preserving privacy are major concerns for training a global deep learning model. This paper proposes a framework that collects a small amount of data from different sources (various hospitals) and trains a global deep learning model using blockchain based federated learning. Blockchain technology authenticates the data and federated learning trains the model globally while preserving the privacy of the organization. First, we propose a data normalization technique that deals with the heterogeneity of data as the data is gathered from different hospitals having different kinds of CT scanners. Secondly, we use Capsule Network-based segmentation and classification to detect COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, we design a method that can collaboratively train a global model using blockchain technology with federated learning while preserving privacy. Additionally, we collected real-life COVID-19 patients data, which is, open to the research community. The proposed framework can utilize up-to-date data which improves the recognition of computed tomography (CT) images. Finally, our results demonstrate a better performance to detect COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges associated with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is to maintain and make use of vehicles health records (VHR). VHR can facilitate different entities to offer various services in a proactive, transparent, secure, reliable and in an efficient manner. The state-of-the-art solutions for maintaining the VHR are centralized in nature, mainly owned by manufacturer and authorized in-vehicle device developers. Owners, drivers, and other key service providers have limited accessibility and control to the VHR. We need to change the strategy from single or limited party access to multi-party access to VHR in an secured manner so that all stakeholders of intelligent transportation system (ITS) can be benefited from this. Any unauthorized attempt to alter the data should also be prevented. Blockchain is one such potential candidate, which can facilitate the sharing of such data among different participating organizations and individuals. For example, owners, manufacturers, trusted third parties, road authorities, insurance companies, charging stations, and car selling ventures can access VHR stored on the blockchain in a permissioned, secured, and with a higher level of confidence. In this paper, a blockchain-based decentralized secure system for V-CARE is proposed to manage records in an interoperable framework that leads to improved ITS services in terms of safety, availability, reliability, efficiency, and maintenance. Insurance based on pay-how-you-drive (PHYD), and sale and purchase of used vehicles can also be made more transparent and reliable without compromising the confidentiality and security of sensitive data.",

    "abstract": "Farmers need to be efficient and dedicate a lot of time in order to sustain the quality of their animals which are in their care. The most convenient and good quality - price ratio should be chosen for the feed of animals. Blockchain is used in a virtual space to store and share information over a network of users. This is done using the open source Hyperledger Fabric platform. The transactions can be viewed by all the other users in real time. These transactions are stored as JSONs inside CouchDB NoSQL database which supports queries on a large volume of data. When using this technology, the farmer can know with whom the supplier for animal feed collaborated with. The history of the transactions are not saved in just one place. In this way, it is more difficult to hack and provide implausible information. An e-learning platform was created where the farm's user can post information, respectively new blocks about the animal's birth, vaccinations, medicines, including the location of the livestock. The same e-learning platform is accessible from the mobile phone. By using the blockchain technology, anyone, including the client from the shop can know a lot about the origin of the products. Fake origins of food are much more difficult to hide. Fraud is also limited. The system monitored the traceability of dairy products inside a Romanian farm. Data about fodder provider and quality, cow productive performances and health and dairy products process were obtained and analyzed by students who will become specialists at all the levels of the food chain. Blockchain is the technology which in case of a dairy products contamination, the origin of the farm is traced in just a couple of seconds. In this way just a batch of dairy products is removed from distribution, leading to the reduction of food waste.",

    "abstract": "In most websites, the online rating system provides the ratings of products and services to users. Lack of trust in data integrity and its manipulation has hindered fulfilling user satisfaction. Since existing online rating systems deal with a central server, all rating data is stored on the central server. Therefore, all rating data can be removed, modified, and manipulated by the system manager to change the ratings in favor of the service or product provider. In this paper, an online rating system using distributed ledger technologies has been presented as the proposed system to solve all the weaknesses of current systems. Distributed ledger technologies are completely decentralized and there is no centralization on them by any institution. Distributed ledger technologies have different variants. Among distributed ledger technologies, blockchain technology has been used in the proposed rating system because of its support for smart contracts. In the proposed online rating system, the Ethereum platform has been chosen from different blockchain platforms that have a public permission network. In this system, the raters cannot rate unless they submit a request to the system and be authorized to take part in the online product rating process. The important feature of the Ethereum platform is its support for smart contracts, which can be used to write the rating contract in the Solidity language. Also, using Proof of Authority consensus mechanisms, all rating transactions are approved by the surveyors. Since in the real Ethereum system, each rating transaction is sent to the network by the raters, some gas must be paid for each rating transaction. However, since this method is expensive, TestNet blockchain can be used in the rating system. Finally, the proposed rating system was used for rating the restaurants of a website and its features were tested.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin was recently introduced as a peer-to-peer electronic currency in order to facilitate transactions outside the traditional financial system. The core of Bitcoin, the Blockchain, is the history of the transactions in the system maintained by all miners as a distributed shared register. New blocks in the Blockchain contain the last transactions in the system and are added by miners after a block mining process that consists in solving a resource consuming proof-of-work (cryptographic puzzle). The reward is a motivation for mining process but also could be an incentive for attacks such as selfish mining. In this paper we propose a solution for one of the major problems in Bitcoin : selfish mining or block-withholding attack. This attack is conducted by adversarial or selfish miners in order to either earn undue rewards or waste the computational power of honest miners. Contrary to recent solutions, our solution, ZeroBlock, prevents block-withholding using a technique free of timestamp that can be forged. Moreover, we show that our solution is compliant with nodes churn.",

Blockchain technology solves the problem of transaction processing and clearing but the fungibility of their units pose a challenge in identifying the issuers and holders of specific equities. Furthermore, as the issuers are in a constant state of flux the benefits of a decentralized network are lost if a central manager is required to cancel equities from companies that no longer exist.

However, the existing state of the art has not focused on the privacy preservation requirement of these energy systems -- the transaction level data can provide much greater insights into a prosumer's behavior compared to smart meter data. There are specific safety requirements in transactive microgrids to ensure the stability of the grid and to control the load. To fulfil these requirements, the distribution system operator needs transaction information from the grid, which poses a further challenge to the privacy-goals. This problem is made worse by requirement for off-blockchain communication in these networks.

Cloud computing relies mainly on a conceptually centralized service provisioning model, while blockchain technologies originate from a peer-to-peer and a completely distributed approach. Still, noteworthy commonalities between both approaches are often overlooked by researchers. Therefore, to the best of the authors knowledge, this paper reviews both domains in parallel for the first time. We conclude that both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of centralized service provisioning approaches are often the disadvantages of distributed ledger approaches and vice versa. It is obviously an interesting question whether both approaches could be combined in a way that the advantages can be added while the disadvantages could be avoided. We derive a software stack that could build the foundation unifying the best of these two worlds and that would avoid existing shortcomings like vendor lock-in, some security problems, and inherent platform dependencies.",

    "abstract": "During the normal operation of a Cloud solution, no one usually pays attention to the logs except technical department, which may periodically check them to ensure that the performance of the platform conforms to the Service Level Agreements. However, the moment the status of a component changes from acceptable to unacceptable, or a customer complains about accessibility or performance of a platform, the importance of logs increases significantly. Depending on the scope of the issue, all departments, including management, customer support, and even the actual customer, may turn to logs to find out what has happened, how it has happened, and who is responsible for the issue. The party at fault may be motivated to tamper the logs to hide their fault. Given the number of logs that are generated by the Cloud solutions, there are many tampering possibilities. While tamper detection solution can be used to detect any changes in the logs, we argue that critical nature of logs calls for immutability. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based log system, called Logchain, that collects the logs from different providers and avoids log tampering by sealing the logs cryptographically and adding them to a hierarchical ledger, hence, providing an immutable platform for log storage.",

Our approach removes third-parties such as credit reporting agencies from the lending process and replaces them with smart contracts. This allows customers to interact directly with the lenders or banks while ensuring the integrity, unmalleability and privacy of their credit data. Most importantly, each customer is given full control over complete or selective disclosure of her credit records, eliminating the risk of privacy violations or data breaches such as the one that happened to Equifax in 2017. Moreover, our approach provides strong guarantees for the lenders as well. A lender can check both correctness and completeness of the credit data disclosed to her. This is the first approach that is able to perform all real-world credit reporting tasks without a central authority or changing the financial mechanisms.",

Proof of Work (PoW), a cryptographic puzzle, plays a vital role in ensuring BC security by maintaining a digital ledger of transactions, which are considered to be incorruptible. Furthermore, BC uses a changeable Public Key (PK) to record the identity of users, thus providing an extra layer of privacy. Not only in cryptocurrency has the successful adoption of the BC been implemented, but also in multifaceted non-monetary systems, such as in: distributed storage systems, proof of location and healthcare. Recent research articles and projects or applications were surveyed to assess the implementation of the BC for IoT Security and identify associated challenges and propose solutions for BC enabled enhanced security for the IoT ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin and Ethereum are novel mechanisms for decentralizing the concept of money and computation. Extending decentralization to the human identity concept, we can think of using blockchain for creating a list of verified human identities with a one-person-one-ID property. UniqueID is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO) for maintaining human identities such that every physical human entity can have no more that one account. One part of this identity is simply the user's claim on one of his unique, permanent, and measurable characteristics -biometrics. Blockchain has proved its integrity as a platform for storing and performing computations on such claims. The biggest challenge here is to ensure that the user has submitted his own valid biometric data. Human verifiers can check if there is any inconsistency in other users' data, by peer-to-peer checks. For preventing bad behavior and centralization in the verification process, UniqueID benefits from novel governance mechanisms to choose verifiers and punish unjust ones. Also, there are incentives for honest verifiers and users by newly generated tokens. We show how the users' privacy can be preserved by using state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques, and so they can use their identity without any concerns for votings, financial and banking purposes, social media accounts, reputation systems etc.",

Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by the use of trusted third-parties such as credit-card companies, mediated escrows, legal adjudication, or reputation systems. Despite the rise of blockchain protocols as a way to send payments without trusted third parties, the important problem of exchanging a digital good for payment without trusted third parties has been paid much less attention. We refer to this problem as the Buyer and Seller's Dilemma and present for it a dual-deposit escrow trade protocol which uses double-sided payment deposits in conjunction with simple cryptographic primitives, and that can be implemented using a blockchain-based smart contract. We analyze our protocol as an extensive-form game and prove that the Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium for this game is for both the buyer and seller to cooperate and behave honestly. We address this problem under the assumption that the digital good being traded is known and verifiable, with a fixed price known to both parties.",

One important question for students is whether or not achievements performed at different universities can be taken into account for either enrolling at a foreign university or for completing the studies at their home university. In addition to university achievements, an increasing proportion of the 195 million students worldwide increasingly receive certificates from MOOCs or other social media services. The integration of such services into university teaching is still in the initial stages and presents some challenges. In this paper we describe the idea to manage all these study achievements worldwide in a blockchain, which might solve the national and international challenges regarding the recognition of student achievements. The aim of this paper is to encourage discussion in the global community instead of presenting a finished concept. Some of the open research questions are: How to ensure student data protection, how to deal with fraud and how to deal with the possibility that students can analytically calculate the easiest way through their studies?",

This paper is an empirical study of the usage of OP_RETURN over the years. We identify several protocols based on OP_RETURN, which we classify by their application domain. We measure the evolution in time of the usage of each protocol, the distribution of OP_RETURN transactions by application domain, and their space consumption.",

However, we find that under-optimized smart contracts cost more gas than necessary, and therefore the creators or users will be overcharged. In this work, we conduct the first investigation on Solidity, the recommended compiler, and reveal that it fails to optimize gas-costly programming patterns. In particular, we identify 7 gas-costly patterns and group them to 2 categories. Then, we propose and develop GASPER, a new tool for automatically locating gas-costly patterns by analyzing smart contracts' bytecodes. The preliminary results on discovering 3 representative patterns from 4,240 real smart contracts show that 93.5%, 90.1% and 80% contracts suffer from these 3 patterns, respectively.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of numerous online content providers, utilities and applications, each with their own specific version of privacy policies and its associated overhead, it is becoming increasingly difficult for concerned users to manage and track the confidential information that they share with the providers. Users consent to providers to gather and share their Personally Identifiable Information (PII). We have developed a novel framework to automatically track details about how a users' PII data is stored, used and shared by the provider. We have integrated our Data Privacy ontology with the properties of blockchain, to develop an automated access control and audit mechanism that enforces users' data privacy policies when sharing their data across third parties. We have also validated this framework by implementing a working system LinkShare. In this paper, we describe our framework on detail along with the LinkShare system. Our approach can be adopted by Big Data users to automatically apply their privacy policy on data operations and track the flow of that data across various stakeholders.",

In order to really resist this malicious adversary and accelerate the usage of the data, it is necessary to store the data on a public chain, which can be seen as a decentralized system. As the increasing amount of the data, the search problem becomes more and more intractable, because there does not exist any effective solution at present. In this paper, we begin by pointing out the importance of storing the data in a public chain. We then innovatively construct a model of SSE using blockchain(SSE-using-BC) and give its security definition to ensure the privacy of the data and improve the search efficiency. According to the size of data, we consider two different cases and propose two corresponding schemes. Lastly, the security and performance analyses show that our scheme is feasible and secure.",

This requirement of storing the entire ledger incurs a high storage cost that grows undesirably large for high transaction rates and large networks. In this work we use the ideas of secret key sharing, private key encryption, and distributed storage to design a coding scheme such that each node stores only a part of the entire transaction thereby reducing the storage cost to a fraction of its original cost. When further using dynamic zone allocation, we show the coding scheme can also improve the integrity of the transaction data in the network over current schemes. Further, block validation (bitcoin mining) consumes a significant amount of energy as it is necessary to determine a hash value satisfying a specific set of constraints; we show that using dynamic distributed storage reduces these energy costs.",

Our initial results indicate that while the lightning network does allow for a substantially higher number of transactions to pass through the system, it does not necessarily provide higher fees to miners, and as a result may in fact lead to lower participation in mining within the system.",

However, its use may very well also lead to increased complexity resulting from having to subsume work that displaced intermediary institutions had performed. We present our perspective that smart contracts may be used to mitigate this increased complexity. We further posit that smart contracts can be delineated according to complexity: Smart contracts that can be verified objectively without much uncertainty belong in an inter-organizational context; those that cannot be objectively verified belong in an intra-organizational context. We state that smart contracts that implement a formal (e.g. mathematical or simulation) model are especially beneficial for both contexts: They can be used to express and enforce inter-organizational agreements, and their basis in a common formalism may ensure effective evaluation and comparison between different intra-organizational contracts. Finally, we present a case study of our perspective by describing Intellichain, which implements formal, agent-based simulation model as a smart contract to provide epidemiological decision support.",

With the advent of blockchain technology and associated smart contracts, code is assuming an even stronger role in regulating people's interactions over the Internet, as many contractual transactions get transposed into smart contract code.

The model yields a market equilibrium depicting traditional and distributed generator and load setpoints. Given these setpoints, crowdsourcing incentives are designed to steer crowdsourcees to the equilibrium. As the number of crowdsourcees and energy trading transactions scales up, a secure energy trading platform is required.

    "abstract": "The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is a de facto standard of secure client-server communication on the Internet. Its security can be diminished by a variety of attacks that leverage on weaknesses in its design and implementations. An example of a major weakness is the public-key infrastructure (PKI) that TLS deploys, which is a weakest-link system and introduces hundreds of links (i.e., trusted entities). Consequently, an adversary compromising a single trusted entity can impersonate any website. Notary systems, based on multi-path probing, were early and promising proposals to detect and prevent such attacks. Unfortunately, despite their benefits, they are not widely deployed, mainly due to their long-standing unresolved problems. In this paper, we present Persistent and Accountable Domain Validation (PADVA), which is a next-generation TLS notary service. PADVA combines the advantages of previous proposals, enhancing them, introducing novel mechanisms, and leveraging a blockchain platform which provides new features. PADVA keeps notaries auditable and accountable, introduces service-level agreements and mechanisms to enforce them, relaxes availability requirements for notaries, and works with the legacy TLS ecosystem. We implemented and evaluated PADVA, and our experiments indicate its efficiency and deployability.",

    "abstract": "We present two models of the block chain of Bitcoin in the interactive theorem prover Agda. The first one is based on a simple model of bank accounts, while having transactions with multiple inputs and outputs. The second model models transactions, which refer directly to unspent transaction outputs, rather than user accounts. The resulting blockchain gives rise to a transaction tree. That model is formalised using an extended form of induction-recursion, one of the unique features of Agda. The set of transaction trees and transactions is defined inductively, while simultaneously recursively defining the list of unspent transaction outputs. Both structures model standard transactions, coinbase transactions, transaction fees, the exact message to be signed by those spending money in a transaction, block rewards, blocks, and the blockchain, and the second structure models as well maturation time for coinbase transactions and Merkle trees. Hashing and cryptographic operations and their correctness are dealt with abstractly by postulating corresponding operations. An indication is given how the correctness of this model could be specified and proven in Agda.",

In this work, a lightweight E-voting system is proposed for voters to minimize their trust in the authority or government. We ensure the transparency of election by putting all message on the Ethereum blockchain, in the meantime, the privacy of individual voter is protected via an efficient and effective ring signature mechanism. Besides, the attractive self-tallying feature is also built in our system, which guarantees that everyone who can access the blockchain network is able to tally the result on his own, no third party is required after voting phase. More importantly, we ensure the correctness of voting results and keep the Ethereum gas cost of individual participant as low as possible, at the same time. Clearly, the pre-described characteristics make our system more suitable for large-scale election.",

These applications provide participants with the capability to exchange not only data but also resources, which raises the concerns of integrity, trust, and above all the need for fair and optimal solutions to the problem of resource allocation. This exchange of information and resources leads to a problem where the stakeholders of the system may have limited trust in each other. Thus, collaboratively reaching consensus on when, how, and who should access certain resources becomes problematic. This paper presents SolidWorx, a blockchain-based platform that provides key mechanisms required for arbitrating resource consumption across different SCC applications in a domain-agnostic manner. For example, it introduces and implements a hybrid-solver pattern, where complex optimization computation is handled off-blockchain while solution validation is performed by a smart contract. To ensure correctness, the smart contract of SolidWorx is generated and verified.",

This new paradigm of applications opens the door to many possibilities and opportunities. However, the security of Ethereum smart contracts has not received much attention; several Ethereum smart contracts malfunctioning have recently been reported. Unlike many previous works that have applied static and dynamic analyses to find bugs in smart contracts, we do not attempt to define and extract any features; instead we focus on reducing the expert's labor costs. We first present a new in-depth analysis of potential attacks methodology and then translate the bytecode of solidity into RGB color code. After that, we transform them to a fixed-sized encoded image. Finally, the encoded image is fed to convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction and learning, detecting compiler bugs of Ethereum smart contract.",

Our fuzzing of 6991 smart contracts has flagged more than 459 vulnerabilities with high precision.

Currently digital evidences CoC is managed entirely manually with entities involved in the chain required to fill in documents accompanying the evidence.

Our architecture follows Event Sourcing pattern which solves current issues of payment solutions such as scaling, transfer, interoperability, low-fees, micropayments and to name a few.

This article completes the FSPVM-E by developing its proof engine. FSPVM-E is an extensible definitional interpreter based on our previous work FEther, which is totally developed in the Coq proof assistant. It supports almost all semantics of the Solidity programing language, and simultaneously executes multiple types of symbols. FEther also contains a set of automatic strategies that execute and verify the smart contracts in Coq with a high level of automation. The functional correctness of FEther was verified in Coq. In standard tutorials, the execution efficiency of FEther far exceeded that of the interpreters developed in Coq.",

A customer prefers to route transactions through the PSP's network if the cheapest path from sender to receiver is financially interesting, i.e., if the path costs less than the blockchain fee. When the graph structure is a tree, and the PSP facilitates all transactions, the problem can be formulated as a linear program. For a path graph, we present a polynomial time algorithm to assign optimal fees.

However, under the dynamics of the primary channel and the uncertainty of the mempool state of the mining pool, it is challenging for the secondary user to determine an optimal transaction transmission policy. In this paper, we propose to use the deep reinforcement learning algorithm to derive an optimal transaction transmission policy for the secondary user. Specifically, we adopt a Double Deep-Q Network (DDQN) that allows the secondary user to learn the optimal policy. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm outperforms the conventional Q-learning scheme in terms of reward and learning speed.",

In this work, we analyze the information revealed by the pattern of transactions in the neighborhood of a given entity transaction. By definition, these features which pertain to an extended network are not directly controllable by the entity, but might enable leakage of information about transacting entities. We define a number of new features relevant to entity characterization on the Bitcoin Blockchain and study their efficacy in practice. We show that even a weak attacker with shallow data mining knowledge is able to leverage these features to characterize the entity properties.",

This is achieved by constructing quorums in a decentralised way: each participant independently chooses whom to trust, and quorums arise from these individual decisions. Unfortunately, the theoretical foundations underlying such blockchains have not been thoroughly investigated. To close this gap, in this paper we study decentralised quorum construction by means of federated Byzantine quorum systems, used by Stellar. We rigorously prove the correctness of basic broadcast abstractions over federated quorum systems and establish their relationship to the classical Byzantine quorum systems. In particular, we prove correctness in the realistic setting where Byzantine nodes may lie about their trust choices. We show that this setting leads to a novel variant of Byzantine quorum systems where different nodes may have different understanding of what constitutes a quorum.",

We establish a novel Markov chain model to characterize all the state transitions of public and private chains. The minimum requirement of Hashrate together with the minimum delay of being profitable is derived in close-form. The former reduces to 21.48% with the symmetric selfish miners, while their competition with asymmetric Hashrates puts forward a higher requirement of the profitable threshold. The profitable delay increases with the decrease of the Hashrate of selfish miners, making the mining pools more cautious on performing selfish mining.",

However, audit logs are vulnerable to a series of attacks, which enable adversaries to tamper data and corresponding audit logs. In this paper, we present BlockAudit: a scalable and tamper-proof system that leverages the design properties of audit logs and security guarantees of blockchains to enable secure and trustworthy audit logs. Towards that, we construct the design schema of BlockAudit, and outline its operational procedures. We implement our design on Hyperledger and evaluate its performance in terms of latency, network size, and payload size. Our results show that conventional audit logs can seamlessly transition into BlockAudit to achieve higher security, integrity, and fault tolerance.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, blockchain-based techniques have been widely used in cybersecurity, owing to the decentralization, anonymity, credibility and not be tampered properties of the blockchain. As one of the decentralized framework, Sapiens Chain was proposed to protect cybersecurity by scheduling the computational resources dynamically, which were owned by Computational Resources Owners (CROs). However, when CROs in the same pool attack each other, all CROs will earn less. In this paper, we tackle the problem of prisoner's dilemma from the perspective of CROs. We first define a game that a CRO infiltrates another pool and perform an attack. In such game, the honest CRO can control the payoffs and increase its revenue. By simulating this game, we propose to apply Zero Determinant (ZD) strategy on strategy decision, which can be categorized into cooperation and defecting. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy decision method.",

Integrating semantic analysis, symbolic execution, and routing learning methods into intelligent auditing, this framework can achieve good accuracy for detecting hidden vulnerabilities. In addition, a revenue incentive mechanism, which aims to donate participants, is built. The practical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

Immutable and transparent, they provide means to implement fault-tolerant and censorship-resistant services. Unfortunately, its immutability causes a serious challenge of ensuring that a business logic and implementation is correct upfront, before publishing in a blockchain. Several big accidents have indeed shown that users of this technology need special tools to verify smart contract correctness. Existing automated checkers are able to detect only well known implementation bugs, leaving the question of business logic correctness far aside. In this work, we present a symbolic model-checking technique along with a formal specification method for a subset of Solidity programming language that is able to express both state properties and trace properties; the latter constitutes a weak analogy of temporal properties. We evaluate the proposed technique on the MiniDAO smart contract, a young brother of notorious TheDAO. Our Proof-of-Concept was able to detect a non-trivial error in the business logic of this smart contract in a few seconds.",

    "abstract": "There has been an unprecedented surge in the number of service providers offering a wide range of machine learning prediction APIs for tasks such as image classification, language translation, etc. thereby monetizing the underlying data and trained models. Typically, a data owner (API provider) develops a model, often over proprietary data, and leverages the infrastructure services of a cloud vendor for hosting and serving API requests. Clearly, this model assumes complete trust between the API Provider and cloud vendor. On the other hand, a malicious/buggy cloud vendor may copy the APIs and offer an identical service, under-report model usage metrics, or unfairly discriminate between different API providers by offering them a nominal share of the revenue. In this work, we present the design of a blockchain based decentralized trustless API marketplace that enables all the stakeholders in the API ecosystem to audit the behavior of the parties without having to trust a single centralized entity. In particular, our system divides an AI model into multiple pieces and deploys them among multiple cloud vendors who then collaboratively execute the APIs. Our design ensures that cloud vendors cannot collude with each other to steal the combined model, while individual cloud vendors and clients cannot repudiate their input or model executions.",

Although the literature features a number of proposals for securing smart contracts, these proposals mostly focus on proving the correctness or absence of a certain type of vulnerability within a contract, but cannot protect deployed (legacy) contracts from being exploited. In this paper, we address this problem in the context of re-entrancy exploits and propose a novel smart contract security technology, dubbed Sereum (Secure Ethereum), which protects existing, deployed contracts against re-entrancy attacks in a backwards compatible way based on run-time monitoring and validation. Sereum does neither require any modification nor any semantic knowledge of existing contracts. By means of implementation and evaluation using the Ethereum blockchain, we show that Sereum covers the actual execution flow of a smart contract to accurately detect and prevent attacks with a false positive rate as small as 0.06% and with negligible run-time overhead. As a by-product, we develop three advanced re-entrancy attacks to demonstrate the limitations of existing offline vulnerability analysis tools.",

We propose a novel method based on game theory: By allowing agents to bet on the outcomes of random events against the miners (who are ultimately responsible for the randomness), we are able to align the incentives so that the distribution of random events is skewed only slightly even if miners are trying to maximise their profit and engage in block withholding to cheat in games.",

Anonymous cryptocurrencies are highly essential since users want to preserve their privacy when conducting transactions. However, some users might misbehave with the cover of anonymity such as rampant trafficking and extortion. Thus, it is important to balance anonymity and accountability of anonymous cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we solve this issue by proposing a linkable group signature (LGS) for signing cryptocurrency transactions, which can be used to trace a payer's identity in consortium blockchain based anonymous cryptocurrencies, in case the payer tries illegal activities. A payer keeps anonymous if he/she behaves honestly. We prove that the proposed scheme achieves full-anonymity, full-traceability and linkability in the random oracle. Implementation of the proposed LGS scheme demonstrates its high efficiency thus, can be adopted in anonymous cryptocurrencies in reality.",

The stakeholders have no mutual trust but interest conflict, which means bad cooperation of them. Due to lack of trust, transferring raw data (e.g., pictures or video clips) between publisher and workers requires the remote platform center to serve as a relay node, which implies network congestion. First we use a reward-penalty model to align the incentives of stakeholders. Then the predefined rules are implemented using blockchain smart contract on many edge servers of the mobile edge computing network, which together function as a trustless hybrid human-machine crowd-intelligence platform. As edge servers are near to workers and publisher, network congestion can be effectively improved.

However, this approach creates considerable complexity in managing trust relationships for both the cloud service providers and their clients. Poor management of trust in federated identity management systems brings with it many security, privacy and interoperability issues, which contributes to the reluctance of organizations to move their critical identity data to the cloud.

Using Bitcoin as an example, we demonstrate that if the attack is implemented successfully, a legitimate user is able to prove that fact of this attack with a high probability. We also consider two options for modification of existing cryptocurrency protocols for dealing with this type of attacks. First, we discuss a modification that requires introducing changes in the Bitcoin protocol and allows diminishing the motivation to attack wallets. Second, an alternative option is the construction of special smart-contracts, which reward the users for providing evidence of the brute-force attack. The execution of this smart-contract can work as an automatic alarm that the employed cryptographic mechanisms, and (particularly) hash functions, have an evident vulnerability.",

These risks threaten the viability of the entire public blockchain ecosystem since exchanges serve as major gateways for participation in public blockchain technologies. In this paper, we develop an economic model to capture the short-term incentives of cryptocurrency exchanges with respect to making security investments and establishing transaction fees. Using the model, we derive conclusions regarding an exchange's optimal economic decisions, and illustrate key features of these conclusions using graphs based on real-world data. Our security investment model exhibits horizontal scaling properties with respect to reducing exposure to losses, and may be of special interest to exchanges operating in markets with high price volatility.",

As a result, we propose a novel model training paradigm based on blockchain, named Galaxy Learning, which aims to train a model with distributed data and to reserve the data ownership for their owners. In this new paradigm, encrypted models are moved around instead, and are federated once trained. Model training, as well as the communication, is achieved with blockchain and its smart contracts. Pricing of training data is determined by its contribution, and therefore it is not about the exchange of data ownership.

After decades of human-centered routines, where devices were merely tools that enabled human beings to authenticate themselves and perform activities, we are now dealing with a device-centered paradigm: the devices themselves are actors, not just tools for people. Conventional identity access management (IAM) frameworks were not designed to handle the challenges of IoT. Trying to use traditional IAM systems to reconcile heterogeneous devices and complex federations of online services (e.g., IoT sensors and cloud computing solutions) adds a cumbersome architectural layer that can become hard to maintain and act as a single point of failure.

Responsibility for executing and validating transactions is shifted to only the clients that have an interest in specific transactions relating to blockchain applications that they use. As the core function of the consensus system of a distributed ledger is to order transactions and ensure their availability, consensus participants do not necessarily need to be concerned with the contents of those transactions. This reduces the problem of block verification to data availability verification, which can be achieved probabilistically with sub-linear complexity, without downloading the whole block. The amount of resources required to reach consensus can thus be minimised, as transaction validity rules can be decoupled from consensus rules. We also implement and evaluate several example LazyLedger applications, and validate that the workload of clients of specific applications does not significantly increase when the workload of other applications that use the same chain increase.",

Each gas unit must be paid using Ether, the crypto-currency of the platform. Due to smart contracts interactions evolving over time, analyzing the behavior of smart contracts is very challenging. We address this challenge in our paper. We develop for this purpose an innovative approach based on the non-negative tensor decomposition PARATUCK2 combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) to assess if predictive analysis can forecast smart contracts interactions over time. To validate our methodology, we report results for two use cases. The main use case is related to analyzing smart contracts and allows shedding some light into the complex interactions among smart contracts.

However, SDN also brings with it some new security challenges, such as single-point failure of the control plane, malicious flows from applications, exposed network-wide resources and a vulnerable channel between the control plane and the data plane.

Our mechanism decentralizes the control plane to overcome single-point failure while maintaining a network-wide view. The mechanism also guarantees the authenticity, traceability, and accountability of application flows, and hence secures the programmable configuration.

Our evaluation shows that Mir orders more than 60000 signed Bitcoin-sized transactions per second on a widely distributed 100 nodes, 1 Gbps WAN setup, while preventing a range of attacks including request duplication performance attacks. To achieve this, Mir relies on a novel protocol mechanism that allows a set of leaders to propose request batches independently, in parallel, while rotating the assignment of a partitioned request hash space to leaders. Several optimizations boost Mir throughput even further, including partial replication through a novel abstraction we call light total order (LTO) broadcast. Perhaps most importantly, Mir relies on proven BFT protocol constructs, which simplifies reasoning about Mir correctness. Specifically, Mir is a generalization of the celebrated and scrutinized PBFT protocol. In a nutshell, Mir follows PBFT ``safety-wise'', with changes needed to accommodate novel features restricted to PBFT liveness.",

This approach leaves them susceptible to manipulation and often causes them to either under- or over-correct. We present Bonded Mining, a proactive DAA that works by collecting hash rate commitments secured by bond from miners. The difficulty is set directly from the commitments and the bond is used to penalize miners who deviate from their commitment. We devise a statistical test that is capable of detecting hash rate deviations by utilizing only on-blockchain data. The test is sensitive enough to detect a variety of deviations from commitments, while almost never misclassifying honest miners. We demonstrate in simulation that, under reasonable assumptions, Bonded Mining is more effective at maintaining a target block time than the Bitcoin Cash DAA, one of the newest and most dynamic DAAs currently deployed. In this preliminary work, the lowest hash rate miner our approach supports is 1% of the total and we directly consider only two types of fundamental attacks.

    "abstract": "Audit logs serve as a critical component in enterprise business systems and are used for auditing, storing, and tracking changes made to the data. However, audit logs are vulnerable to a series of attacks enabling adversaries to tamper data and corresponding audit logs without getting detected. Among them, two well-known attacks are \"the physical access attack,\" which exploits root privileges, and \"the remote vulnerability attack,\" which compromises known vulnerabilities in database systems. In this paper, we present BlockAudit: a scalable and tamper-proof system that leverages the design properties of audit logs and security guarantees of blockchain to enable secure and trustworthy audit logs. Towards that, we construct the design schema of BlockAudit and outline its functional and operational procedures. We implement our design on a custom-built Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) blockchain system and evaluate the performance in terms of latency, network size, payload size, and transaction rate. Our results show that conventional audit logs can seamlessly transition into BlockAudit to achieve higher security and defend against the known attacks on audit logs.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing, is an emerging manufacturing technology that is expected to have far-reaching socioeconomic, environmental, and geopolitical implications. As the use of this technology increases, the need for validation of 3D designs grows. In order to create a marketplace in which 3D designs are traded, it is necessary to develop a platform that enables the attestation of the 3D designs and promotes truthfulness. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of a distributed marketplace that will support the attestation of 3D printing designs. We build a mathematical trust model that ensures truthfulness among rational, selfish, and independent agents, which is based on a reward/penalty system. The payment for participating in the evaluation is calculated by factoring in agents' reputation and peer feedback. Moreover, we describe the architecture and the implementation of the trust model on blockchain using smart contracts for the creation of a distributed marketplace. Our model relies both on theoretical and practical best practices to create an unique platform that elicit effort and truthfulness from the participants.",

Although the security of the Ethereum ecosystem has been studied in the past, the network layer has been mostly neglected. We show that Go Ethereum (Geth), the most widely used Ethereum implementation, is vulnerable to eclipse attacks, effectively circumventing recently introduced (Geth v1.8.0) security enhancements. We responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to core Ethereum developers; the corresponding countermeasures to our attack where incorporated into the v1.9.0 release of Geth. Our false friends attack exploits the Kademlia-inspired peer discovery logic used by Geth and enables a low-resource eclipsing of long-running, remote victim nodes. An adversary only needs two hosts in distinct /24 subnets to launch the eclipse, which can then be leveraged to filter the victim's view of the Blockchain. We discuss fundamental properties of Geth's node discovery logic that enable the false friends attack, as well as proposed and implemented countermeasures.",

However, these systems often rely on a trusted third party (oracle) to get correct information about the real-world events, which trigger the financial transactions. In this paper, we identify two biggest challenges in building decentralized, trustless and transparent oracles. The first challenge is acquiring correct information about the real-world events without relying on a trusted information provider. We show how a peer-consistency incentive mechanism can be used to acquire truthful information from an untrusted and self-interested crowd, even when the crowd has outside incentives to provide wrong information. The second is a system design and implementation challenge. For the first time, we show how to implement a trustless and transparent oracle in Ethereum. We discuss various non-trivial issues that arise in implementing peer-consistency mechanisms in Ethereum, suggest several optimizations to reduce gas cost and provide empirical analysis.",

The framework is modular and it can be adjusted for different needs or sets of assumptions. We prove that sharded protocols obtained by following our scheme (with correct modules in place) live up to the same safety and liveness guarantees as their non-sharded counterparts. The proof is general and relies on well-defined specifications of certain components. This lays the ground for simple proofs of correctness for sharded protocols obtained by following the proposed scheme. The framework is not left as an obscure specification of some high level structure; explicit use is demonstrated by applying it to shard Algorand. As part of this concrete construction, a tamper-proof mechanism to assign nodes to shards is introduced. This mechanism is constructed by using verifiable random functions and can safely withstand a powerful adaptive adversary.",

This is consistent with the findings of other teams, while several known experiments suggest that given enough computing power, NAS algorithms can surpass state-of-the-art neural network models designed by humans. In this paper, we propose a blockchain network protocol that incentivises independent computing nodes to run NAS algorithms and compete in finding better neural network models for a particular task.

Our algorithm enables any node to verify the full availability of any data block generated by the system by just downloading a $\\Theta(1)$ byte block hash commitment and randomly sampling $\\Theta(\\log b)$ bytes, where $b$ is the size of the data block. With the help of only one connected honest node in the system, our method also allows any node to verify any tampering of the coded Merkle tree by just downloading $\\Theta(\\log b)$ bytes. We provide a modular library for CMT in Rust and Python and demonstrate its efficacy inside the Parity Bitcoin client.",

More in detail, authentication of the issuing institution is performed by retrieving an unauthenticated issuer profile online, and comparing some data reported there with those included in the issued certificate. We show that, by fabricating a fake issuer profile and generating a suitably altered certificate, an attacker is able to impersonate a legitimate issuer and can produce certificates that cannot be distinguished from originals by the Blockcerts validation procedure. We also propose some possible countermeasures against an attack of this type, which require the use of a classic public key infrastructure or a decentralized identity system integrated with the Blockcerts protocol.",

We propose a usable blockchain- and smart contracts-based framework that allows users to store research data locally and share without losing control and ownership of it. We have created smart contracts for building automatic verification of the conditions for data access that also naturally supports building up a verifiable record of the provenance, incentives for users to share their data and accountability of access. The paper presents a review of the existing work of research data sharing, the proposed blockchain-based framework and an evaluation of the framework by measuring the transaction cost for smart contracts deployment. The results show that nodes responded quickly in all tested cases with a befitting transaction cost.",

In this paper we focus on decentralisation in quorum-based approaches to open (permissionless) consensus as illustrated in influential protocols such as the Ripple and Stellar protocols. Drawing from game theory and computational complexity, we establish limiting results concerning the decentralisation vs. safety trade-off in Ripple and Stellar, and we propose a novel methodology to formalise and quantitatively analyse decentralisation in this type of blockchains.",

In addition, it is shown that regulating the number of nodes (as in a permissioned network) does not lead to additional cost savings that cannot otherwise be achieved via a setting of block rewards in a permissionless (i.e., free entry) network. This suggests that permissioned networks will not be able to economize on costs relative to permissionless networks.",

These mechanisms are based upon repeated games with two classes of players: queriers who desire to get common knowledge truths onto the blockchain and a pool of reporters who posses such common knowledge. Presented with a new oracle query, reporters have an opportunity to report the truth in return for a fee provided by the querier. During subsequent oracle queries, the querier has an opportunity to punish any reporters who did not report truthfully during previous rounds. While the set of reporters has the power to cause the oracle to lie, they are incentivized not to do so.",

In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of this theoretical model by implementing such a managed cryptocurrency architecture through forking the Bitcoin code base. We discovered that the theoretical model contains several vulnerabilities and security issues that needed to be mitigated. It also contains architectural features that presented significant implementation challenges; some aspects of the proposed changes to the Bitcoin specification were not practical or even workable. In this work we describe how we mitigated the security vulnerabilities and overcame the architectural hurdles to build a working prototype.",

The protocol maintains shares of the decryption key of the private information of an information sender using a group of trustees recruited in a blockchain network before the specified future time-frame and restores the information to the information recipient at the required time-frame. To tackle the key challenges that limit the security and scalability of the protocol, SilentDelivery incorporates two novel countermeasure strategies. The first strategy, namely silent recruitment, enables a trustee to get recruited by a sender silently without the knowledge of any third party. The second strategy, namely dual-mode execution, makes the protocol run in a lightweight mode by default, where the cost of running smart contracts is reduced from O(n) to O(1). We implement the protocol over the Ethereum official test network. The results demonstrate that SilentDelivery is more secure and scalable compared to the state of the art and reduces the cost of running smart contracts by 85%.",

    "abstract": "In the fifth-generation (5G) networks and the beyond, communication latency and network bandwidth will be no more bottleneck to mobile users. Thus, almost every mobile device can participate in the distributed learning. That is, the availability issue of distributed learning can be eliminated. However, the model safety will become a challenge. This is because the distributed learning system is prone to suffering from byzantine attacks during the stages of updating model parameters and aggregating gradients amongst multiple learning participants. Therefore, to provide the byzantine-resilience for distributed learning in 5G era, this article proposes a secure computing framework based on the sharding-technique of blockchain, namely PIRATE. A case-study shows how the proposed PIRATE contributes to the distributed learning. Finally, we also envision some open issues and challenges based on the proposed byzantine-resilient learning framework.",

Although smart contracts are promising to drive the new wave of innovation in business processes, there are a number of challenges to be tackled.This paper presents a survey on smart contracts.

The mainstream countermeasures, namely PPS (pay-per-share) and PPLNS (pay-per-last-N-share), can hedge pool hopping, but pose a risk to the pool as well as the cost to miners. In this study, we apply the zero-determinant (ZD) theory to design a novel pooled mining which offers an incentive mechanism for motivating non-memorial and memorial evolutionary miners not to switch in pools strategically. In short, our hopping-proof pooled mining has three unique features: 1) fee-free. No fee is charged if the miner does not hop. 2) wide applicability. It can be employed in both prepaid and postpaid mechanisms. 3) fairness. Even the pool can dominate the game with any miner, he has to cooperate when the miner does not hop among pools. The fairness of our scheme makes it have long-term sustainability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a hopping-proof pooled mining with the above three natures simultaneously. Both theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.",

Blockchain (BC), a distributed ledger technology used in cryptocurrency has attracted significant attention in the realm of IoT security and privacy. However, adopting BC to IoT is not straightforward in most cases, due to overheads and delays caused by BC operations. In this paper, we apply a BC technology known as Hyperledgder Fabric, to an IoT network. This technology introduces an execute-order technique for transactions that separates the transaction execution from consensus, resulting in increased efficiency. We demonstrate that our proposed IoT-BC architecture is sufficiently secure with regard to fundamental security goals i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, the simulation results are highlighted that shows the performance overheads associated with our approach are as minimal as those associated with the Hyperledger Fabric framework and negligible in terms of security and privacy.",

The Wibson marketplace will provide infrastructure and financial incentives for individuals to securely sell personal information without sacrificing personal privacy. Data Buyers receive information from willing and actively participating individuals with the benefit of knowing that the personal information should be accurate and current. We present here two different components working together to achieve an efficient decentralized marketplace. The first is a smart contract called Data Exchange, which stores references to Data Orders that different Buyers open in order to show to the market that they are interested in buying certain types of data, and provides secure mechanisms to perform the transactions.

This results in a gas reduction of the transfer costs of three orders of magnitude, achieving around 1700 transactions per second on the Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, it includes many relevant features, like meta-transactions for end-user operation without ether, and key-locked payments for atomic exchange of digital goods.",

We make some abstractions that over-approximate the way in which Solidity/Ethereum behave. Based on this formalisation, we create Solidifier: a bounded model checker for Solidity. It translates Solid into Boogie, an intermediate verification language, that is later verified using Corral, a bounded model checker for Boogie. Unlike much of the work in this area, we do not try to find specific behavioural/code patterns that might lead to vulnerabilities. Instead, we provide a tool to find errors/bad states, i.e. program states that do not conform with the intent of the developer. Such a bad state, be it a vulnerability or not, might be reached through the execution of specific known code patterns or through behaviours that have not been anticipated.",

Corruption through contract fraud is often conducted by withholding and/or altering financial information. When such scandals are investigated by authorities, financial and legal documents are usually altered to conceal the paper trail. Smart contracts have emerged in recent years and appear promising for applications such as legal contracts where transparency is critical and of public interest. Transparency and auditability are inherent because smart contracts execute operations on the blockchain, a distributed public ledger. In this paper, we propose the Minimum Hybrid Contract (MHC), with the aim of introducing 1) auditability, 2) transparency, and 3) immutability to the contract's financial transactions. The MHC comprises an online smart contract and an offline traditional legal contract. where the two are immutably linked. Secure peer-to-peer financial transactions, transparency, and cost accounting are automated by the smart contract, and legal issues or disputes are carried out by civil courts. The reliance on established legal processes facilitates an appropriate adoption of smart contracts in traditional contracts.",

In this paper, we propose FedCoin, a blockchain-based peer-to-peer payment system for FL to enable a feasible SV based profit distribution. In FedCoin, blockchain consensus entities calculate SVs and a new block is created based on the proof of Shapley (PoSap) protocol. It is in contrast to the popular BitCoin network where consensus entities \"mine\" new blocks by solving meaningless puzzles. Based on the computed SVs, a scheme for dividing the incentive payoffs among FL clients with nonrepudiation and tamper-resistance properties is proposed. Experimental results based on real-world data show that FedCoin can promote high-quality data from FL clients through accurately computing SVs with an upper bound on the computational resources required for reaching consensus. It opens opportunities for non-data owners to play a role in FL.",

    "abstract": "Network traffic whitelisting has emerged as a dominant approach for securing consumer IoT devices. However, determining what the whitelisted behavior of an IoT device should be remains an open challenge. Proposals to date have relied on manufacturers and trusted parties to provide whitelists, but these proposals require manufacturer involvement or placing trust in an additional stakeholder. Alternatively, locally monitoring devices can allow building whitelists of observed behavior, but devices may not exhaust their functionality set during the observation period, or the behavior may change following a software update which requires re-training. This paper proposes a blockchain-based system for determining whether an IoT device is behaving like other devices of the same type. Our system (SERENIoT, pronounced Serenity) overcomes the challenge of initially determining the correct behavior for a device. Nodes in the SERENIoT public blockchain submit summaries of the network behavior observed for connected IoT devices and build whitelists of behavior observed by the majority of nodes. Changes in behavior through software updates are automatically whitelisted once the update is broadly deployed. Through a proof-of-concept implementation of SERENIoT on a small Raspberry Pi IoT network and a large-scale Amazon EC2 simulation, we evaluate the security, scalability, and performance of our system.",

In the traditional economy, credit bears the risk that the borrower may default on its debt, the lender hence requires an upfront collateral from the borrower, plus interest fee payments. Due to the atomicity of blockchain transactions, lenders can offer flash loans, i.e. loans that are only valid within one transaction and must be repaid by the end of that transaction. This concept has lead to a number of interesting attack possibilities, some of which have been exploited recently (February 2020). This paper is the first to explore the implication of flash loans for the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We analyze two existing attacks vectors with significant ROIs (beyond 500k%), and then go on to formulate finding flash loan-based attack parameters as an optimization problem over the state of the underlying Ethereum blockchain as well as the state of the DeFi ecosystem. Specifically, we show how two previously executed attacks can be \"boosted\" to result in a profit of 829.5k USD and 1.1M USD, respectively, which is a boost of 2.37x and 1.73x, respectively.",

Many of these issues could be mitigated via an effective access control system, however, its realization is challenging due to the properties of current blockchain platforms (like lack of privacy, costly on-chain resources, or latency). To address this problem, we propose the SMACS framework, where updatable and sophisticated Access Control Rules (ACRs)} for smart contracts can be realized with low cost. SMACS shifts the burden of expensive ACRs validation and management operations to an off-chain infrastructure, while implementing on-chain only lightweight token-based access control. SMACS is flexible and in addition to simple access control lists can easily implement rules enhancing the runtime security of smart contracts. With dedicated ACRs backed by vulnerability-detection tools, SMACS can protect vulnerable contracts after deployment. We fully implement SMACS and evaluate it.",

This however restricts the scaling potential to nodes within a private, trusted computer cluster. In this research we propose a novel blockchain protocol that allows parallel local search to scale to untrusted and anonymous computational nodes. The protocol introduces publicly verifiable performance evaluation of the local optima reported by each node, creating a competitive environment between the local searches. That is strengthened with economical stimuli for producing good solutions, that provide coordination between the nodes, as every node tries to explore different sections of the search space to beat their competition.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are programs that implement potentially sophisticated transactions on modern blockchain platforms. In the rapidly evolving blockchain environment, smart contract programming languages must allow users to write expressive programs that manage and transfer assets, yet provide strong protection against sophisticated attacks. Addressing this need, we present flexible and reliable abstractions for programming with digital currency in the Move language [Blackshear et al. 2019]. Move uses novel linear [Girard 1987] resource types with semantics drawing on C++11 [Stroustrup 2013] and Rust [Matsakis and Klock 2014]: when a resource value is assigned to a new memory location, the location previously holding it must be invalidated. In addition, a resource type can only be created or destroyed by procedures inside its declaring module. We present an executable bytecode language with resources and prove that it enjoys resource safety, a conservation property for program values that is analogous to conservation of mass in the physical world.",

    "abstract": "Permissioned blockchains are supported by identified but individually untrustworthy nodes, collectively maintaining a replicated ledger whose content is trusted. The Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain system targets high-throughput transaction processing. Fabric uses a set of nodes tasked with the ordering of transactions using consensus. Additional peers endorse and validate transactions, and maintain a copy of the ledger. The ability to quickly disseminate new transaction blocks from ordering nodes to all peers is critical for both performance and consistency. Broadcast is handled by a gossip protocol, using randomized exchanges of blocks between peers. We show that the current implementation of gossip in Fabric leads to heavy tail distributions of block propagation latencies, impacting performance, consistency, and fairness. We contribute a novel design for gossip in Fabric that simultaneously optimizes propagation time, tail latency and bandwidth consumption. Using a 100-node cluster, we show that our enhanced gossip allows the dissemination of blocks to all peers more than 10 times faster than with the original implementation, while decreasing the overall network bandwidth consumption by more than 40%. With a high throughput and concurrent application, this results in 17% to 36% fewer invalidated transactions for different block sizes.",

Our work presents the analysis of the dynamical properties of the ERC20 protocol compliant crypto-coins' trading data using a network theory prism. We examine the dynamics of ERC20 based networks over time by analyzing a meta-parameter of the network, the power of its degree distribution. Our analysis demonstrates that this parameter can be modeled as an under-damped harmonic oscillator over time, enabling a year forward of network parameters predictions.",

In this paper, we propose to improve the IoT architecture with additional security features using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. We propose a novel architecture based on permissioned blockchain technology in order to build a scalable and decentralized end-to-end secure IoT system.

Existing solutions, dating back to Rivest, Shamir and Wagner, either do not scale or rely on synchrony for the commitment phase and trust of $t/n$ parties. We formalize the problem of implementing such commitments with a probabilistic delay and without the aforementioned assumptions as Multi-Party Timed Commitments (MPTC) and present a solution -- the Time-Capsule protocol. Like previous approaches, Time Capsule forms a puzzle whose solution reveals the committed values. But unlike previous solutions, no party has an advantage in solving the puzzle, and individual commitments cannot be revealed before the entire set is committed. A particular application of MPTC realizes an advancement in the study of decentralized systems. The state of the art in decentralized systems is manifested in blockchain systems that utilize Proof of Work to achieve censorship resistance. However, they are still vulnerable to frontrunning, an issue that is plaguing operational systems. By adapting Time Capsule, we allow it to be used for Proof of Work, preventing frontrunning by system operators and tuning the puzzle difficulty using the blockchain mechanism.",

We demonstrate how distributed-ledger technologies build investor trust and disrupt the auditing industry. Our multi-functional design indicates that auditing firms can automate transaction verification without the need for a trusted third party by collaborating and sharing their information while preserving data privacy (commitment scheme) and security (immutability). We also explore how smart contracts and wallets facilitate the computerization and implementation of our system on Ethereum. Finally, performance evaluation reveals the efficacy and scalability of FutureAB in terms of both encryption (0.012 seconds per transaction) and verification (0.001 seconds per transaction).",

TCR is an automated way to create lists of any kind where decisions (whether to include N or not) are made through voting that brings benefit or loss to voters. In an academic journal, TCR could act as a tool to introduce community-driven decisions on papers to be published, thus encouraging more active participation of authors and reviewers in editorial policy and elaborating the idea of a journal as a club. TCR could also provide a novel solution to the problems of editorial bias and the lack of rewards/incentives for reviewers. In the paper, we discuss core principles of TCR, its technological and cultural foundations, and finally analyze the risks and challenges it could bring to scholarly publishing.",

    "abstract": "The Byzantine agreement problem is considered to be a core problem in distributed systems. For example, Byzantine agreement is needed to build a blockchain, a totally ordered log of records. Blockchains are asynchronous distributed systems, fault-tolerant against Byzantine nodes. In the literature, the asynchronous byzantine agreement problem is studied in a fully connected network model where every node can directly send messages to every other node. This assumption is questionable in many real-world environments. In the reality, nodes might need to communicate by means of an incomplete network, and Byzantine nodes might not forward messages. Furthermore, Byzantine nodes might not behave correctly and, for example, corrupt messages. Therefore, in order to truly understand Byzantine Agreement, we need both ingredients: asynchrony and incomplete communication networks. In this paper, we study the asynchronous Byzantine agreement problem in incomplete networks. A classic result by Danny Dolev proved that in a distributed system with n nodes in the presence of f Byzantine nodes, the vertex connectivity of the system communication graph should be at least (2f+1). While Dolev's result was for synchronous deterministic systems, we demonstrate that the same bound also holds for asynchronous randomized systems. We show that the bound is tight by presenting a randomized algorithm, and a matching lower bound.",

Decentralized management of these new market participants is challenging in terms of market settlement, participant reputation and consideration of grid constraints. This paper proposes a blockchain-enabled framework for P2P energy trading among producer and consumer agents in a smart grid. A fully decentralized market settlement mechanism is designed, which does not rely on a centralized entity to settle the market and encourages producers and consumers to negotiate on energy trading with their nearby agents truthfully. To this end, the electrical distance of agents is considered in the pricing mechanism to encourage agents to trade with their neighboring agents. In addition, a reputation factor is considered for each agent, reflecting its past performance in delivering the committed energy. Before starting the negotiation, agents select their trading partners based on their preferences over the reputation and proximity of the trading partners. An Anonymous Proof of Location (A-PoL) algorithm is proposed that allows agents to prove their location without revealing their real identity. The practicality of the proposed framework is illustrated through several case studies, and its security and privacy are analyzed in detail.",

    "abstract": "Initiated from Nakamoto's Bitcoin system, blockchain technology has demonstrated great capability of building secure consensus among decentralized parties at Internet-scale, i.e., without relying on any centralized trusted party. Nowadays, blockchain systems find applications in various fields. But the performance is increasingly becoming a bottleneck, especially when permissionless participation is retained for full decentralization. In this work, we present a new consensus protocol named GHAST (Greedy Heaviest Adaptive Sub-Tree) which organizes blocks in a Tree-Graph structure (i.e., a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a tree embedded) that allows fast and concurrent block generation. GHAST protocol simultaneously achieves a logarithmically bounded liveness guarantee and low confirmation latency. More specifically, for maximum latency $d$ and adversarial computing power bounded away from 50\\%, GHAST guarantees confirmation with confidence $\\ge 1-\\varepsilon$ after a time period of $O(d\\cdot \\log(1/\\varepsilon))$. When there is no observable attack, GHAST only needs $3d$ time to achieve confirmation at the same confidence level as six-block-confirmation in Bitcoin, while it takes roughly $360d$ in Bitcoin.",

We conclude that neither miners nor mining pools who seek to maximize their compound return will have a financial incentive to occupy more than 50% of the hash rate if the cost of mining is at the same level for all. However, if there is an outstandingly cost-efficient miner, then the market share of this miner may exceed 50% in the equilibrium, which can threaten the viability of the entire ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Most PoW blockchain protocols operate with a simple mechanism whereby a threshold is set for each block and miners generate block hashes until one of those values falls below the threshold. Although largely effective, this mechanism produces blocks at a highly variable rate and also leaves a blockchain susceptible to chain death, i.e. abandonment in the event that the threshold is set too high to attract any miners. A recent innovation called real-time block rate targeting, or RTT, fixes these problems by reducing the target throughout the mining interval. RTT exhibits much less variable block times and even features the ability to fully adjust the target after each block. However, as we show in this paper, RTT also suffers from a critical vulnerability whereby miners deviate form the protocol to increase their profits. We introduce the Radium protocol, which mitigates this vulnerability in RTT while retaining lower variance block times, responsive target adjustment, and lowering the risk of chain death. We also show that Radium's susceptibility to the doublespend attack and orphaned blocks remains similar to Bitcoin.",

However, by interacting with the Bisq DAO, participants necessarily publish data to the Bitcoin blockchain and broadcast additional data to the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We examine the privacy cost to participants in sharing this data. Specifically, we use a novel address clustering heuristic to construct the one-to-many mappings from participants to addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain and augment the address clusters with data stored within the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We show that this technique aggregates activity performed by each participant: trading, voting, transfers, etc. We identify instances where participants are operating under multiple aliases, some of which are real-world names. We identify the dominant transactors and their role in a two-sided market. We conclude with suggestions to better protect the privacy of participants in the future.",

Water, as a national need, is considered to be one of the main causes for conflicts in the 21st century. Peer-to-peer trading is one of the most convenient, scalable and sustainable solutions but faces organization challenges such as: the absence of suitable business models motivating normal users to sell their generated resources, currency and financial settlement complexities, and single utility markets. We propose a multi-utility trading platform, based on blockchain technology which can address the challenges faced by peer-to-peer trading. This platform meets the needs of developing countries in particular as well as rural areas of developed countries. The open nature of our proposed design makes it suitable for adoption and use by various stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in blockchain sharding protocols is that more than 95% transactions are cross-shard. Not only those cross-shard transactions degrade the system throughput but also double the confirmation time, and exhaust an already scarce network bandwidth. Are cross-shard transactions imminent for sharding schemes? In this paper, we propose a new sharding paradigm, called OptChain, in which cross-shard transactions are minimized, resulting in almost twice faster confirmation time and throughput. By treating transactions as a stream of nodes in an online graph, OptChain utilizes a lightweight and on-the-fly transaction placement method to group both related and soon-related transactions into the same shards. At the same time, OptChain maintains a temporal balance among shards to guarantee the high parallelism. Our comprehensive and large-scale simulation using Oversim P2P library confirms a significant boost in performance with up to 10 folds reduction in cross-shard transactions, more than twice reduction in confirmation time, and 50% increase in throughput. When combined with Omniledger sharding protocol, OptChain delivers a 6000 transactions per second throughput with 10.5s confirmation time.",

In this paper we collected a list of security patterns for DApps. Moreover, based on these patterns, we provide the reader with security assessment checklists that can be easily used for the development of SCs. We cover the phases of design, coding, and testing and deployment of the software lifecycle. In this way, we allow developers to easily verify if they applied all the relevant security patterns to their smart contracts.

Therefore, voltage monitoring becomes essential, which demands efficient measurement and storage of voltage data. However, there is hardly any system till date that fulfils both the goals of voltage monitoring and voltage data storage. To achieve this goal, we propose the application of the Internet of Things along with the server-based framework and Distributed Ledger Technology to build systems for smart voltage monitoring. Two models - a centralised model and a decentralised model have been presented and analysed thoroughly in this paper. The centralised model is built on client-server architecture, whereas the decentralised model is based on a peer-to-peer architecture. Blockchain and InterPlanetary File System have been used for the implementation of the decentralised system. Potential improvements to make these systems robust have also been discussed. The methods proposed in this paper for voltage monitoring are novel; ensure efficient data storage and can be used for IoT data storage of any form.",

With the rise of blockchain technologies over the last few years, there has been a move away from both centralized servers and traditional federated models to more decentralized peer-to-peer alternatives. However, there appears to be a trilemma between security, scalability, and decentralization in blockchain-based systems. Deconstructing this trilemma using well-known threat models, we define a typology of centralized, federated, and decentralized architectures. Each of the different architectures has this trilemma play out differently. Facing a possible decentralized future, we outline seven hard problems facing decentralization and theorize that the differences between centralized, federated, and decentralized architectures depend on differing social interpretations of trust.",

The feature engineering not only requires much human effort, but the effectiveness of the intuitively designed features can not be guaranteed. In this paper, we aim to mining the abundant patterns encoded in bitcoin transactions, and propose k-order transaction graph to reveal patterns under different scope.

For example, under the traditional electric power billing scheme, electric power has to be consumed where it is needed so that end-users could not charge their electric vehicles at different points (e.g. a relative's house) if this the correct user is not billed (this due to the high consumption of electrical energy that makes it expensive).

However, the traditional FL framework heavily relies on the single central server and may fall apart if such a server behaves maliciously. To address this single point of the potentially failure issue, this work proposes a blockchain aided FL framework. The proposed framework can well prevent the malicious UEs from poisoning the learning process, and further provide a self-motivated and reliable learning environment for UEs.

This is done by formulating a tractable stochastic model and using tools from applied probability and analysis, including the explicit solution of a certain type of advanced functional differential equation. The expected profit at a future time point is determined for the situation when the miner follows the protocol as well as when he/she withholds blocks.

This survey aims to analyze and summarize the existing literature on analyzing and understanding cryptocurrency transactions from a network perspective. Aiming to provide a systematic guideline for researchers and engineers, we present the background information of cryptocurrency transaction network analysis and review existing research in terms of three aspects, i.e., network modeling, network profiling, and network-based detection. For each aspect, we introduce the research issues, summarize the methods, and discuss the results and findings given in the literature. Furthermore, we present the main challenges and several future directions in this area.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of a business environment often causes organizations to produce several inconsistent views on the same business process, leading to fragmentation and inefficiencies. Business process view integration attempts to produce an integrated view from different views of the same model, facilitating the management of models. To study trends around business process view integration, we conduct a systematic literature review to summarize findings since the 1970s, up to its potential novel applications. With a starting corpus of 798 documents, this survey draws up a systematic inventory of solutions used in academia and in the industry. By narrowing it down to 51 articles, we discuss in-depth 15 business process integration techniques papers. After that, we classify existing solutions according to their practicality. Our study shows that most integrated views are constructed by annotation, using formal merging rules. Finally, we explore possible future research directions. We highlight the application of view integration to the blockchain research area, where stakeholders can have different views on the same blockchain. We expect that this study contributes to interdisciplinary research across view integration.",

With the emergence of vertical solutions in healthcare institutions, interoperability across organisations has been hindered. The authors of this paper propose a blockchain based medical-data sharing solution, utilising Hyperledger Fabric to regulate access to medical data, and using the InterPlanatory File System for its storage. We believe that the combination of these two distributed solutions can enable patients to access their medical records across healthcare institutions while ensuring non-repudiation, immutability and providing data-ownership. It would enable healthcare practitioners to access all previous medical records in a single location, empowering them with the data required for the effective diagnosis and treatment of patients. Making it safe and straightforward, it would also enable patients to share medical data with research institutions, leading to the creation of reliable data sets, laying the groundwork required for the creation of personalised medicine.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Payment channels networks drastically increase the throughput and hence scalability of blockchains by performing transactions \\emph{off-chain}. In an off-chain payment, parties deposit coins in a channel and then perform transactions without invoking the global consensus mechanism of the blockchain. However, the transaction value is limited by the capacity of the channel, i.e., the amount of funds available on a channel. These funds decrease when a transaction is sent and increase when a transaction is received on the channel. Recent research indicates that there is an imbalance between sending and receiving transactions, which leads to channel depletion in the sense that one of these operations becomes impossible over time due to the lack of available funds. We incentivize the balanced use of payment channels through fees. Whereas the current fee model depends solely on the transaction value, our fee policies encourage transactions that have a positive effect on the balance in a channel and discourage those that have a negative effect. This paper first defines necessary properties of fee strategies. Then, it introduces two novel fees strategies that provably satisfy all necessary properties. Our extensive simulation study reveals that these incentives increase the effectiveness of payments by $8\\%$ to $19\\%$.",

    "abstract": "In blockchain-based anonymous cryptocurrencies, due to their tamper-resistance and transparency characteristics, transaction data are initially required to be anonymous, with the help of various cryptographic techniques, e.g., commitment schemes and zero-knowledge proofs. Also, cryptocurrencies are different from existing anonymous messaging protocols regarding the software architecture and the underlying security model. Due to these differences, the sense of anonymity must be specifically defined for anonymous cryptocurrencies, and the anonymity in each anonymous cryptocurrency must be analyzed and evaluated based on the specific architecture model. In this paper, we first propose a specific architecture model with three software layers to anonymous cryptocurrencies. Next, we introduce definitions of fundamental privacy properties (Pfitzmann's anonymity, unlinkability, and pseudonymity) and comprehensively analyze each privacy property for each architecture layer of anonymous cryptocurrencies to establish a privacy evaluation policy for anonymous cryptocurrencies. Finally, we fairly compare the privacy of current leading anonymous cryptocurrencies (e.g., Zerocash, CryptoNote, and Mimblewimble) using the privacy evaluation policy.",

Watchtowers are entities that watch the blockchain on behalf of their offline clients to protect the clients' interests in applications such as payment networks (e.g., the Lightning network). In practice, there is no trust between clients and watchtowers, and it is challenging to incentivize watchtowers to well-behave (e.g., to refuse bribery). To showcase our reputation system, in this work, we create an open market of watchtowers, where watchtowers are motivated to not only deliver their promised service but also reduce their service fees in competition with each other.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are distributed, self-enforcing programs executing on top of blockchain networks. They have the potential to revolutionize many industries such as financial institutes and supply chains. However, smart contracts are subject to code-based vulnerabilities, which casts a shadow on its applications. As smart contracts are unpatchable (due to the immutability of blockchain), it is essential that smart contracts are guaranteed to be free of vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, smart contract languages such as Solidity are Turing-complete, which implies that verifying them statically is infeasible. Thus, alternative approaches must be developed to provide the guarantee. In this work, we develop an approach which automatically transforms smart contracts so that they are provably free of 4 common kinds of vulnerabilities. The key idea is to apply runtime verification in an efficient and provably correct manner. Experiment results with 5000 smart contracts show that our approach incurs minor run-time overhead in terms of time (i.e., 14.79%) and gas (i.e., 0.79%).",

In contrast to Nakamoto Consensus where any block obtains higher assurance as buried deeper in the blockchain, in BFT SMR, any committed block is secure has a fixed resilience threshold. In this paper, we investigate strengthened fault tolerance (SFT) in BFT SMR under partial synchrony, which provides gradually increased resilience guarantees (like Nakamoto Consensus) during an optimistic period when the network is synchronous and the number of Byzantine faults is small. Moreover, the committed blocks can tolerate more than one-third (up to two-thirds) corruptions even after the optimistic period. Compared to the prior best solution Flexible BFT which requires quadratic message complexity, our solution maintains the linear message complexity of state-of-the-art BFT SMR protocols and requires only marginal bookkeeping overhead. We implement our solution over the open-source Diem project, and give experimental results that demonstrate its efficiency under real-world scenarios.",

    "author": [

    ],
    "abstract": "Blockchain systems are designed to produce blocks at a constant average rate. The most popular systems currently employ a Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm as a means of creating these blocks. Bitcoin produces, on average, one block every 10 minutes. An unfortunate limitation of all deployed PoW blockchain systems is that the time between blocks has high variance. For example, 5% of the time, Bitcoin's inter-block time is at least 40 minutes. This variance impedes the consistent flow of validated transactions through the system. We propose an alternative process for PoW-based block discovery that results in an inter-block time with significantly lower variance. Our algorithm, called Bobtail, generalizes the current algorithm by comparing the mean of the k lowest order statistics to a target. We show that the variance of inter-block times decreases as k increases. If our approach were applied to Bitcoin, about 80% of blocks would be found within 7 to 12 minutes, and nearly every block would be found within 5 to 18 minutes; the average inter-block time would remain at 10 minutes. Further, we show that low-variance mining significantly thwarts doublespend and selfish mining attacks. For Bitcoin and Ethereum currently (k=1), an attacker with 40% of the mining power will succeed with 30% probability when the merchant sets up an embargo of 8 blocks; however, when k>=20, the probability of success falls to less than 1%. Similarly, for Bitcoin and Ethereum currently, a selfish miner with 40% of the mining power will claim about 66% of blocks; however, when k>=5, the same miner will find that selfish mining is less successful than honest mining. The cost of our approach is a larger block header.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid increase of threats on the Internet, people are continuously seeking privacy and anonymity. Services such as Bitcoin and Tor were introduced to provide anonymity for online transactions and Web browsing. Due to its pseudonymity model, Bitcoin lacks retroactive operational security, which means historical pieces of information could be used to identify a certain user. We investigate the feasibility of deanonymizing users of Tor hidden services who rely on Bitcoin as a payment method by exploiting public information leaked from online social networks, the Blockchain, and onion websites. This, for example, allows an adversary to link a user with @alice Twitter address to a Tor hidden service with private.onion address by finding at least one past transaction in the Blockchain that involves their publicly declared Bitcoin addresses. To demonstrate the feasibility of this deanonymization attack, we carried out a real-world experiment simulating a passive, limited adversary. We crawled 1.5K hidden services and collected 88 unique Bitcoin addresses. We then crawled 5B tweets and 1M BitcoinTalk forum pages and collected 4.2K and 41K unique Bitcoin addresses, respectively. Each user address was associated with an online identity along with its public profile information. By analyzing the transactions in the Blockchain, we were able to link 125 unique users to 20 Tor hidden services, including sensitive ones, such as The Pirate Bay and Silk Road. We also analyzed two case studies in detail to demonstrate the implications of the resulting information leakage on user anonymity. In particular, we confirm that Bitcoin addresses should always be considered exploitable, as they can be used to deanonymize users retroactively. This is especially important for Tor hidden service users who actively seek and expect privacy and anonymity.",

    "abstract": "While cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications continue to gain popularity, their energy cost is evidently becoming unsustainable. In most instances, the main cost comes from the required amount of energy for the Proof-of-Work, and this cost is inherent to the design. In addition, useless costs from discarded work (e.g., the so-called Forks) and lack of scalability (in number of users and in rapid transactions) limit their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we present an innovative scheme which eliminates the nonce and thus the burden of the Proof-of-Work which is the main cause of the energy waste in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. We prove that our scheme guarantees a tunable and bounded average number of simultaneous mining whatever the size of the population in competition, thus by making the use of nonce-based techniques unnecessary, achieves scalability without the cost of consuming a large volume of energy. The technique used in the proof of our scheme is based on the analogy of the analysis of a green leader election. The additional difference with Proof-of-Work schemes (beyond the suppression of the nonce field that is triggering most of the waste), is the introduction of (what we denote as) \"empty blocks\" which aim are to call regular blocks following a staircase set of values. Our scheme reduces the risk of Forks and provides tunable scalability for the number of users and the speed of block generation. We also prove using game theoretical analysis that our scheme is resilient to unfair competitive investments (e.g., \"51 percent\" attack) and block nursing.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Ledger Technology, popularized by the Bitcoin network, aims to keep track of a ledger of valid transactions between agents of a virtual economy without a central institution for coordination. In order to keep track of a faithful and accurate list of transactions, the ledger is broadcast and replicated across machines in a peer-to-peer network. To enforce validity of transactions in the ledger (i.e., no negative balance or double spending), the network as a whole coordinates to accept or reject new transactions based on a set of rules aiming to detect and block operations of malicious agents (i.e., Byzantine attacks). Consensus protocols are particularly important to coordinate operation of the network, since they are used to reconcile potentially conflicting versions of the ledger. Regardless of architecture and consensus mechanism used, resulting economic networks remain largely similar, with economic agents driven by incentives under a set of rules. Due to the intense activity in this area, proper mathematical frameworks to model and analyze behavior of blockchain-enabled systems are essential. In this paper, we address this need and provide the following contributions: (i) we establish a formal framework, with tools from dynamical systems theory, to mathematically describe core concepts in blockchain-enabled networks, (ii) we apply this framework to the Bitcoin network and recover its key properties, and (iii) we connect our modeling framework with powerful tools from control engineering, such as Lyapunov-like functions, to properly engineer economic systems with provable properties. Apart from the aforementioned contributions, the mathematical framework herein proposed lays a foundation for engineering more general economic systems built on emerging Turing complete networks, such as the Ethereum network, through which complex alternative economic models are explored.",

    "abstract": "The blockchain technology has potential applications in various areas such as smart-contracts, Internet of Things (IoT), land registry, supply chain management, storing medical data, and identity management. Although the Github currently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain software (BCS) projects, few software engineering research has investigated these projects and its' contributors. Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the differences between BCS and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified via mining the Github repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. The results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced in non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating a decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open Source Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93% of our respondents found BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS projects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the non-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects, decentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty in upgrading the software after release. Software development tools that are tuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an array of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development tasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable simulators, and BCS domain specific design notations.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing development of advanced communication technologies, vehicles are becoming smarter and more connected. Due to the tremendous growth of various vehicular applications, a huge amount of data is generated through advanced on-board devices and is deemed critical to improve driving safety and enhance vehicular services. However, cloud based models often fall short in applications where latency and mobility are critical. In order to fully realize the potential of vehicular networks, the challenges of efficient communication and computation need to be addressed. In this direction, vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged which extends the concept of fog computing to conventional vehicular networks. It is a geographically distributed paradigm that has the potential to conduct time-critical and data-intensive tasks by pushing intelligence (i.e. computing resources, storage, and application services) in the vicinity of end vehicles. However secure and reliable transmission are of significant importance in highly-mobile vehicular networks in order to ensure the optimal Quality of Service (QoS). In this direction, several authentication mechanisms have been proposed in the literature but most of them are found unfit due to absence of decentralization, anonymity, and trust characteristics. Thus, an effective cross-datacenter authentication and key-exchange scheme based on blockchain and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is proposed in this paper. Here, the distributed ledger of blockchain is used for maintaining the network information while the highly secure ECC is employed for mutual authentication between vehicles and road side units (RSUs). Additionally, the proposed scheme is lightweight and scalable for the considered VFC setup. The performance evaluation results against the existing state-of-the-art reveal that the proposed scheme accomplishes enhanced security features.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks have emerged as a new technology in modern electric power transmission networks. It allows bi-directional flow of communication and electricity between electric vehicles (EVs) and the Smart Grid (SG), in order to provide more sophisticated energy trading. However, due to the involvement of a huge amount of trading data and the presence of untrusted entities in the visiting networks, the underlying V2G infrastructure suffers from various security and privacy challenges. Although, several solutions have been proposed in the literature to address these problems, issues like lack of mutual authentication and anonymity, incapability to protect against several attack vectors, generation of huge overhead, and dependency on centralized infrastructures make security and privacy issues even more challenging. To address the above mentioned problems, in this paper, we propose a blockchain oriented hierarchical authentication mechanism for rewarding EVs. The overall process is broadly classified into the following phases: 1) System Initialization, 2) Registration, 3) Hierarchical Mutual Authentication, and 4) Consensus; wherein blockchain's distributed ledger has been employed for transaction execution in distributed V2G environments while Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has been used for hierarchical authentication. The designed hierarchical authentication mechanism has been employed to preserve the anonymity of EVs and support mutual authentication between EVs, charging stations (CSs) and the central aggregator (CAG). Additionally, it also supports minimal communicational and computational overheads on resource constrained EVs. Further, formal security verification of the proposed scheme on widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool validates its safeness against different security attacks.",

    "abstract": "Prosumers in many regions are facing reduced feed-in tariffs and currently have no possibility to influence the level of remuneration for the locally produced solar energy. Peer-to-peer communities may offer an alternative to the feed-in tariff model by enabling prosumers to directly sell their solar energy to local consumers (possibly at a rate that is beneficial for both consumer and prosumer). The Quartierstrom project investigates a transactional energy system that manages the exchange and remuneration of electricity between consumers, prosumers and the local electric grid provider in the absence of intermediaries. This whitepaper describes the prototypical real-world system being implemented in the town of Walenstadt, Switzerland, with 37 participating households. The community members of this pilot project pay a reduced tariff for grid usage if the electricity produced by a prosumer is sold to another community member, which is located on the same voltage or grid level downstream a substation1. Such a tariff structure incentivizes local balancing, i.e. locally produced energy can be consumed locally whenever possible to avoid costs from higher grid levels. The blockchain is a novel technology suitable to log the produced and consumed units of energy within a community, making it possible to implement market places. In those marketplaces, both prosumers and consumers can indicate a price at which they are willing to sell / buy locally produced solar energy without the intermediation of a utility. The key goals of this project are the assessment of A) the technical, economical and ecological feasibility of a blockchain-based community energy system regarding local utilization of solar energy, grid quality and energy efficiency and B) resulting dynamics regarding local market prices and user acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are software programs featuring both traditional applications and distributed data storage on blockchains. Ethereum is a prominent blockchain platform with the support of smart contracts. The smart contracts act as autonomous agents in critical decentralized applications and hold a significant amount of cryptocurrency to perform trusted transactions and agreements. Millions of dollars as part of the assets held by the smart contracts were stolen or frozen through the notorious attacks just between 2016 and 2018, such as the DAO attack, Parity Multi-Sig Wallet attack, and the integer underflow/overflow attacks. These attacks were caused by a combination of technical flaws in designing and implementing software codes. However, many more vulnerabilities of less severity are to be discovered because of the scripting natures of the Solidity language and the non-updateable feature of blockchains. Hence, we surveyed 16 security vulnerabilities in smart contract programs, and some vulnerabilities do not have a proper solution. This survey aims to identify the key vulnerabilities in smart contracts on Ethereum in the perspectives of their internal mechanisms and software security vulnerabilities. By correlating 16 Ethereum vulnerabilities and 19 software security issues, we predict that many attacks are yet to be exploited. And we have explored many software tools to detect the security vulnerabilities of smart contracts in terms of static analysis, dynamic analysis, and formal verification. This survey presents the security problems in smart contracts together with the available analysis tools and the detection methods. We also investigated the limitations of the tools or analysis methods with respect to the identified security vulnerabilities of the smart contracts.",

    "title": "Flood & Loot: A Systemic Attack On The Lightning Network",
    "author": [
      "Jona Harris",

    ],
    "abstract": "The Lightning Network promises to alleviate Bitcoin's known scalability problems. The operation of such second layer approaches relies on the ability of participants to turn to the blockchain to claim funds at any time, which is assumed to happen rarely. One of the risks that was identified early on is that of a wide systemic attack on the protocol, in which an attacker triggers the closure of many Lightning channels at once. The resulting high volume of transactions in the blockchain will not allow for the proper settlement of all debts, and attackers may get away with stealing some funds. This paper explores the details of such an attack and evaluates its cost and overall impact on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Specifically, we show that an attacker is able to simultaneously cause victim nodes to overload the Bitcoin blockchain with requests and to steal funds that were locked in channels. We go on to examine the interaction of Lightning nodes with the fee estimation mechanism and show that the attacker can continuously lower the fee of transactions that will later be used by the victim in its attempts to recover funds - eventually reaching a state in which only low fractions of the block are available for lightning transactions. Our attack is made easier even further as the Lightning protocol allows the attacker to increase the fee offered by his own transactions. We continue to empirically show that the vast majority of nodes agree to channel opening requests from unknown sources and are therefore susceptible to this attack. We highlight differences between various implementations of the Lightning Network protocol and review the susceptibility of each one to the attack. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies to lower the systemic attack risk of the network.",

    "abstract": "Smart Contracts and transactions allow users to implement elaborate constructions on cryptocurrency blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Many of these constructions, including operational payment channels and atomic swaps, use a building block called Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC). In this work, we distill from HTLC a specification (HTLC-Spec), and present an implementation called Mutual-Assured-Destruction Hashed Time-Locked Contract (MAD-HTLC). MAD-HTLC employs a novel approach of utilizing the existing blockchain operators, called miners, as part of the design. If a user misbehaves, MAD-HTLC incentivizes the miners to confiscate all her funds. We prove MAD-HTLC's security using the UC framework and game-theoretic analysis. We demonstrate MAD-HTLC's efficacy and analyze its overhead by instantiating it on Bitcoin's and Ethereum's operational blockchains. Notably, current miner software makes only little effort to optimize revenue, since the advantage is relatively small. However, as the demand grows and other revenue components shrink, miners are more motivated to fully optimize their fund intake. By patching the standard Bitcoin client, we demonstrate such an optimization is easy to implement, making the miners natural enforcers of MAD-HTLC. Finally, we extend previous results regarding HTLC vulnerability to bribery attacks. An attacker can incentivize miners to prefer her transactions by offering high transaction fees. We demonstrate this attack can be easily implemented by patching the Bitcoin client, and use game-theoretic tools to qualitatively tighten the known cost bound of such bribery attacks in presence of rational miners. We identify bribe opportunities occurring on the Bitcoin and Ethereum main networks where a few dollars bribe could yield tens of thousands of dollars in reward (e.g., \\$2 for over \\$25K).",

    "abstract": "We consider the privacy of interactions between individuals in a network. For many networks, while nodes are anonymous to outside observers, the existence of a link between individuals implies the possibility of one node revealing identifying information about its neighbor. Moreover, while the identities of the accounts are likely hidden to an observer, the network of interaction between two anonymous accounts is often available. For example, in blockchain cryptocurrencies, transactions between two anonymous accounts are published openly. Here we consider what happens if one (or more) parties in such a network are deanonymized by an outside identity. These compromised individuals could leak information about others with whom they interacted, which could then cascade to more and more nodes' information being revealed. We use a percolation framework to analyze the scenario outlined above and show for different likelihoods of individuals possessing information on their counter-parties, the fraction of accounts that can be identified and the idealized minimum number of steps from a deanonymized node to an anonymous node (a measure of the effort required to deanonymize that individual). We further develop a greedy algorithm to estimate the \\emph{actual} number of steps that will be needed to identify a particular node based on the noisy information available to the attacker. We apply our framework to three real-world networks: (1) a blockchain transaction network, (2) a network of interactions on the dark web, and (3) a political conspiracy network. We find that in all three networks, beginning from one compromised individual, it is possible to deanonymize a significant fraction of the network ($>50$%) within less than 5 steps. Overall these results provide guidelines for investigators seeking to identify actors in anonymous networks, as well as for users seeking to maintain their privacy.",

    "abstract": "In today's world, social networks have become one of the primary sources for creation and propagation of news. Social news aggregators are one of the actors in this area in which users post news items and use positive or negative votes to indicate their preference toward a news item. News items will be ordered and displayed according to their aggregated votes. This approach suffers from several problems raging from being prone to the dominance of the majority to difficulty in discerning between correct and fake news, and lack of incentive for honest behaviors. In this paper, we propose a graph-based news aggregator in which instead of voting on the news items, users submit their votes on the relations between pairs of news items. More precisely, if a user believes two news items support each other, he will submit a positive vote on the link between the two items, and if he believes that two news items undermine each other, he will submit a negative vote on the corresponding link. This approach has mainly two desirable features: (1) mitigating the effect of personal preferences on voting, (2) connection of new items to endorsing and disputing evidence. This approach helps the newsreaders to understand different aspects of a news item better. We also introduce an incentive layer that uses blockchain as a distributed transparent manager to encourages users to behave honestly and abstain from adversary behaviors. The incentive layer takes into account that users can have different viewpoints toward news, enabling users from a wide range of viewpoints to contribute to the network and benefit from its rewards. In addition, we introduce a protocol that enables us to prove fraud in computations of the incentive layer model on the blockchain. Ultimately, we will analyze the fraud proof protocol and examine our incentive layer on a wide range of synthesized datasets.",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have made payment transactions possible without a trusted third party, but they have a scalability issue due to their consensus mechanisms. Payment networks have emerged to overcome this limitation by executing transactions outside of the blockchain, which is why these are referred to as off-chain transactions. In order to establish a payment channel between two users, the users lock their deposits in the blockchain, and then they can pay each other through the channel. Furthermore, payment networks support multi-hop payments that allow users to transfer their balances to other users who are connected to them via multiple channels. However, multi-hop payments are hard to be accomplished, as they are heavily dependent on routing users on a payment path from a sender to a receiver. Although routing hubs can make multi-hop payments more practical and efficient, they need a lot of collateral locked for a long period and have privacy issues in terms of payment history. We propose RouTEE, a secure payment routing hub that is fully feasible without the hub's deposit. Unlike existing payment networks, RouTEE provides high balance liquidity, and details about payments are concealed from hosts by leveraging trusted execution environments (TEEs). RouTEE is designed to make rational hosts behave honestly, by introducing a new routing fee scheme and a secure settlement method. Moreover, users do not need to monitor the blockchain in real-time or run full nodes. They can participate in RouTEE by simply verifying block headers through light clients; furthermore, having only one channel with RouTEE is sufficient to interact with other users. Our implementation demonstrates that RouTEE is highly efficient and outperforms Lightning Network that is the state-of-the-art payment network.",

We map sixteen proposed privacy-preserving techniques for Bitcoin on an obfuscation-vs.-cryptography axis, and find that those that are used in practice tend toward obfuscation. We argue that this has led to a balance between privacy and regulatory acceptance.",

However, market participants who desire to hold derivative assets such as options or futures would also benefit from trustless exchange. In this paper I propose the atomic swaption, which extends the atomic swap to allow for such exchanges. Crucially, atomic swaptions do not require the use of oracles. I also introduce the margin contract, which provides the ability to create leveraged and short positions. Lastly, I discuss how atomic swaptions may be routed on the Lightning Network.",

In such multi-agent systems, the protocol for plan execution must result in the proper completion and ordering of actions in spite of their distributed execution. However, in untrusted scenarios, there is a possibility of agents not respecting the protocol either due to faults or due to malicious reasons thereby resulting in plan failure. In order to prevent such situations, we propose to implement the execution of agents through smart contracts. This points to a generic architecture seamlessly integrating intelligent planning-based CPS and smart-contracts.",

In general, the real identity behind cryptocurrency addresses is not known, however, some addresses can be clustered according to their ownership by analyzing behavioral patterns, allowing those with known attribution to be assigned labels. These labels may be further used for legal and compliance purposes to assist in law enforcement investigations. In this document, we discuss our methodology behind assigning attribution labels to cryptocurrency addresses.",

Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, i.e., it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed. We show that the Bitcoin protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners obtain a revenue larger than their fair share. This attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency. Selfish mining is feasible for any group size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects against selfish mining pools that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a group of any size can compromise the system.",

The block creation rewards and transaction fees are reallocated to establish and staff a secure financial data network capable of handling the world's transactions with subsecond response time. The new system pays dividends to stake-offering bitcoin holders. In contrast to Satoshi Nakamoto's mesh network consisting of competing peers, this system uses an enterprise class network that is efficient, robust, and scalable, consisting of cooperating peers. The network backbone nodes host trustless nomadic agents. Thousands of distributed full nodes are paid to replicate a singleton blockchain built upon every 10 minutes by a nomadic mint agent whose actions are verified by its peers. This arrangement enables immediate acknowledgment to an issuing node that its transaction has been accepted. Less effort means that subsidized transaction costs will be lower. Network reconfiguration enables the processing of numerous microtransactions. Stake-weighted distributed consensus is achieved when necessary with less than one-half arbitrarily faulty nodes. Important invariants of the Satoshi Social Contract between core developers and users are maintained: The reward schedule, the blockchain format, the fixed number of bitcoins, and the decentralized, trustless protocol are untouched. The system remains a global distributed database, with additions to the database by consent of the majority, based on a set of transparent rules they follow.",

    "abstract": "PGP is built upon a Distributed Web of Trust in which the trustworthiness of a user is established by others who can vouch through a digital signature for that particular identity. Preventing its wholesale adoption are a number of inherent weaknesses to include (but not limited to) the following: 1) Trust Relationships are built on a subjective honor system, 2) Only first degree relationships can be fully trusted, 3) Levels of trust are difficult to quantify with actual values, and 4) Issues with the Web of Trust itself (Certification and Endorsement). Although the security that PGP provides is proven to be reliable, it has largely failed to garner large scale adoption. In this paper, we propose several novel contributions to address the aforementioned issues with PGP and associated Web of Trust. To address the subjectivity of the Web of Trust, we provide a new certificate format based on Bitcoin which allows a user to verify a PGP certificate using Bitcoin identity-verification transactions - forming first degree trust relationships that are tied to actual values (i.e., number of Bitcoins transferred during transaction). Secondly, we present the design of a novel Distributed PGP key server that leverages the Bitcoin transaction blockchain to store and retrieve Bitcoin-Based PGP certificates. Lastly, we provide a web prototype application that demonstrates several of these capabilities in an actual environment.",

Conventional security and privacy approaches tend to be inapplicable for IoT, mainly due to its decentralized topology and the resource-constraints of the majority of its devices. BlockChain BC that underpin the crypto-currency Bitcoin have been recently used to provide security and privacy in peer-to-peer networks with similar topologies to IoT. However, BCs are computationally expensive and involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not suitable for IoT devices. This position paper proposes a new secure, private, and lightweight architecture for IoT, based on BC technology that eliminates the overhead of BC while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits. The described method is investigated on a smart home application as a representative case study for broader IoT applications. The proposed architecture is hierarchical, and consists of smart homes, an overlay network and cloud storages coordinating data transactions with BC to provide privacy and security. Our design uses different types of BCs depending on where in the network hierarchy a transaction occurs, and uses distributed trust methods to ensure a decentralized topology. Qualitative evaluation of the architecture under common threat models highlights its effectiveness in providing security and privacy for IoT applications.",

Once network communication becomes synchronous, HotStuff enables a correct leader to drive the protocol to consensus at the pace of actual (vs. maximum) network delay--a property called responsiveness--and with communication complexity that is linear in the number of replicas. To our knowledge, HotStuff is the first partially synchronous BFT replication protocol exhibiting these combined properties. HotStuff is built around a novel framework that forms a bridge between classical BFT foundations and blockchains. It allows the expression of other known protocols (DLS, PBFT, Tendermint, Casper), and ours, in a common framework. Our deployment of HotStuff over a network with over 100 replicas achieves throughput and latency comparable to that of BFT-SMaRt, while enjoying linear communication footprint during leader failover (vs. quadratic with BFT-SMaRt).",

However, PoW-based systems incur a high delay and low throughput, making them ineffective in dealing with real-time applications. On the other hand, byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms with better delay and throughput performance have been employed in closed (permissioned) settings to avoid Sybil attacks. In this paper, we present Sybil-proof wirelEss Network coordinAte based byzanTine consEnsus (SENATE), which is based on the conventional BFT consensus framework yet works in open systems of wireless devices where faulty nodes may launch Sybil attacks. As in a Senate in the legislature where the quota of senators per state (district) is a constant irrespective with the population of the state, \"senators\" in SENATE are selected from participating distributed nodes based on their wireless network coordinates (WNC) with a fixed number of nodes per district in the WNC space. Elected senators then participate in the subsequent consensus reaching process and broadcast the result. Thereby, SENATE is proof against Sybil attacks since pseudonyms of a faulty node are likely to be adjacent in the WNC space and hence fail to be elected.",

As of August 2017, the Bitcoin blockchain is about 120 GiB big while it was only 75 GiB in August 2016. To benefit from Bitcoin full security model, a bootstrapping node has to download and verify the entirety of the 120 GiB. This poses a challenge for low-resource devices such as smartphones. Thankfully, an alternative exists for such devices which consists of downloading and verifying just the header of each block. This partial block verification enables devices to reduce their bandwidth requirements from 120 GiB to 35 MiB. However, this drastic decrease comes with a safety cost implied by a partial block verification. In this work, we enable low-resource devices to fully verify subchains of blocks without having to pay the onerous price of a full chain download and verification; a few additional MiB of bandwidth suffice. To do so, we propose the design of diet nodes that can securely query full nodes for shards of the UTXO set, which is needed to perform full block verification and can otherwise only be built by sequentially parsing the chain.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies secure a decentralized consensus protocol by incentives. The protocol participants, called miners, generate (mine) a series of blocks, each containing monetary transactions created by system users. As incentive for participation, miners receive newly minted currency and transaction fees paid by transaction creators. Blockchain bandwidth limits lead users to pay increasing fees in order to prioritize their transactions. However, most prior work focused on models where fees are negligible. In a notable exception, Carlsten et al. postulated in CCS'16 that if incentives come only from fees then a mining gap would form~--- miners would avoid mining when the available fees are insufficient. In this work, we analyze cryptocurrency security in realistic settings, taking into account all elements of expenses and rewards. To study when gaps form, we analyze the system as a game we call \\emph{the gap game}. We analyze the game with a combination of symbolic and numeric analysis tools in a wide range of scenarios. Our analysis confirms Carlsten et al.'s postulate; indeed, we show that gaps form well before fees are the only incentive, and analyze the implications on security. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that different miners choose different gap sizes to optimize their utility, even when their operating costs are identical. Alarmingly, we see that the system incentivizes large miner coalitions, reducing system decentralization. We describe the required conditions to avoid the incentive misalignment, providing guidelines for future cryptocurrency design.",

    "abstract": "Many of today's crypto currencies use blockchains as decentralized ledgers and secure them with proof of work. In case of a fork of the chain, Bitcoin's rule for achieving consensus is selecting the longest chain and discarding the other chain as stale. It has been demonstrated that this consensus rule has a weakness against selfish mining in which the selfish miner exploits the variance in block generation by partially withholding blocks. In Ethereum, however, under certain conditions stale blocks don't have to be discarded but can be referenced from the main chain as uncle blocks yielding a partial reward. This concept limits the impact of network delays on the expected revenue for miners. But the concept also reduces the risk for a selfish miner to gain no rewards from withholding a freshly minted block. This paper uses a Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the effect of uncle blocks both to the profitability of selfish mining and the blockchain's security in Ethereum (ETH). A brief outlook about a recent Ethereum Classic (ETC) improvement proposal that weighs uncle blocks during the selection of the main chain will be given.",

Ranging from smart home, smart building, to smart city, all these smart infrastructures must be supported by intelligent power supply.

In smart grid, in order to realize optimal scheduling, a Smart Meter (SM) is installed at each home to collect the near real-time electricity consumption data, which can be used by the utilities to offer better smart home services. However, the near real-time data may disclose user's privacy. An adversary may track the application usage patterns by analyzing the user's electricity consumption profile. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving and efficient data aggregation scheme. We divide users into different groups and each group has a private blockchain to record its members' data. To preserve the inner privacy within a group, we use pseudonym to hide user's identity, and each user may create multiple pseudonyms and associate his/her data with different pseudonyms. In addition, the bloom filter is adopted for fast authentication. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme can meet the security requirements, and achieve a better performance than other popular methods.",

To prevent such issues, Google introduced the concept of Certificate Transparency (CT) in 2013. Later, several new PKI models (e.g., AKI, ARPKI, and DTKI) are proposed to reduce the level of trust to the CAs. However, all of these proposals are still vulnerable to split-world attacks if the adversary is capable of showing different views of the log to the targeted victims. In this paper, we propose a new PKI architecture with certificate transparency based on blockchain, what we called CertLedger, to eliminate the split-world attacks and to provide an ideal certificate/revocation transparency. All TLS certificates, their revocation status, entire revocation process, and trusted CA management are conducted in the CertLedger. CertLedger provides a unique, efficient, and trustworthy certificate validation process eliminating the conventional inadequate and incompatible certificate validation processes implemented by different software vendors. TLS clients in the CertLedger also do not require to make certificate validation and store the trusted CA certificates anymore.

Peer-to-peer networks provide many advantages, like decentralization, which might be applicable to electronic voting systems. Therefore, we take a look on the distributed database called blockchain and the usage in a peer-to-peer voting system. Our contribution to this topic is a modification of the proof-of-stake, which enables the usage of common devices, like smartphones or tablets, for the blockchain verification and inclusion of new ballots to the chain. This proof does not need much computing power and has a lower carbon footprint than the proof-of-work in the Bitcoin protocol.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, as deployed today, cannot scale for wide-spread use. A leading approach for cryptocurrency scaling is a smart contract mechanism called a payment channel which enables two mutually distrustful parties to transact efficiently (and only requires a single transaction in the blockchain to set-up). Payment channels can be linked together to form a payment network, such that payments between any two parties can (usually) be routed through the network along a path that connects them. Crucially, both parties can transact without trusting hops along the route. In this paper, we propose a novel variant of payment channels, called Sprites, that reduces the worst-case \"collateral cost\" that each hop along the route may incur. The benefits of Sprites are two-fold. 1) In Lightning Network, a payment across a path of $\\ell$ channels requires locking up collateral for $\\Theta(\\ell\\Delta)$ time, where $\\Delta$ is the time to commit an on-chain transaction. Sprites reduces this cost to $O(\\ell + \\Delta)$. 2) Unlike prior work, Sprites supports partial withdrawals and deposits, during which the channel can continue to operate without interruption. In evaluating Sprites we make several additional contributions. First, our simulation-based security model is the first formalism to model timing guarantees in payment channels. Our construction is also modular, making use of a generic abstraction from folklore, called the \"state channel,\" which we are the first to formalize. We also provide a simulation framework for payment network protocols, which we use to confirm that the Sprites construction mitigates against throughput-reducing attacks.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous and self-driving vehicles are appearing on the public highways. These vehicles commonly use wireless communication techniques for both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Manufacturers, regulators and the public are understandably concerned about large-scale systems failure or malicious attack via these wireless vehicular networks. This paper explores the use of sensing and signalling devices that are commonly integrated into modern vehicles for side-channel communication purposes. Visible light (using a CMOS camera) and acoustic (ultrasonic audio) side-channel encoding techniques are proposed, developed and evaluated in this context. The side-channels are examined both theoretically and experimentally and an upper bound on the line code modulation rate that is achievable with these side channel schemes in the vehicular networking context is established. A novel inter-vehicle session key establishment protocol, leveraging both side-channels and a blockchain public key infrastructure, is then presented. In light of the limited channel capacity and the interoperability/security requirements for vehicular communications, techniques for constraining the throughput requirement, providing device independence and validating the location of the intended recipient vehicle, are presented. These reduce the necessary device handshake throughput to 176 bits for creating symmetric encryption and message authentication keys and in verifying a vehicle's certificate with a recognised certification authority.",

BC has the potential to overcome security and privacy challenges of Internet of Things (IoT). However, BC is computationally expensive, has limited scalability and incurs significant bandwidth overheads and delays which are not suited to the IoT context. We propose a tiered Lightweight Scalable BC (LSB) that is optimized for IoT requirements. We explore LSB in a smart home setting as a representative example for broader IoT applications. Low resource devices in a smart home benefit from a centralized manager that establishes shared keys for communication and processes all incoming and outgoing requests. LSB achieves decentralization by forming an overlay network where high resource devices jointly manage a public BC that ensures end-to-end privacy and security. The overlay is organized as distinct clusters to reduce overheads and the cluster heads are responsible for managing the public BC. LSB incorporates several optimizations which include algorithms for lightweight consensus, distributed trust and throughput management. Qualitative arguments demonstrate that LSB is resilient to several security attacks. Extensive simulations show that LSB decreases packet overhead and delay and increases BC scalability compared to relevant baselines.",

    "abstract": "BlockChain (BC) immutability ensures BC resilience against modification or removal of the stored data. In large scale networks like the Internet of Things (IoT), however, this feature significantly increases BC storage size and raises privacy challenges. In this paper, we propose a Memory Optimized and Flexible BC (MOF-BC) that enables the IoT users and service providers to remove or summarize their transactions and age their data and to exercise the \"right to be forgotten\". To increase privacy, a user may employ multiple keys for different transactions. To allow for the removal of stored transactions, all keys would need to be stored which complicates key management and storage. MOF-BC introduces the notion of a Generator Verifier (GV) which is a signed hash of a Generator Verifier Secret (GVS). The GV changes for each transaction to provide privacy yet is signed by a unique key, thus minimizing the information that needs to be stored. A flexible transaction fee model and a reward mechanism is proposed to incentivize users to participate in optimizing memory consumption. Qualitative security and privacy analysis demonstrates that MOF-BC is resilient against several security attacks. Evaluation results show that MOF-BC decreases BC memory consumption by up to 25\\% and the user cost by more than two orders of magnitude compared to conventional BC instantiations.",

    "abstract": "An atomic cross-chain swap is a distributed coordination task where multiple parties exchange assets across multiple blockchains, for example, trading bitcoin for ether. An atomic swap protocol guarantees (1) if all parties conform to the protocol, then all swaps take place, (2) if some coalition deviates from the protocol, then no conforming party ends up worse off, and (3) no coalition has an incentive to deviate from the protocol. A cross-chain swap is modeled as a directed graph ${\\cal D}$, whose vertexes are parties and whose arcs are proposed asset transfers. For any pair $({\\cal D},L)$, where ${\\cal D} = (V,A)$ is a strongly-connected directed graph and $L \\subset V$ a feedback vertex set for ${\\cal D}$, we give an atomic cross-chain swap protocol for ${\\cal D}$, using a form of hashed timelock contracts, where the vertexes in $L$ generate the hashlocked secrets. We show that no such protocol is possible if ${\\cal D}$ is not strongly connected, or if ${\\cal D}$ is strongly connected but $L$ is not a feedback vertex set. The protocol has time complexity $O(diam({\\cal D}))$ and space complexity (bits stored on all blockchains) $O(|A|^2)$.",

While the data collected from vehicular sensors and vehicular communications is an integral part of the evidence for arbitrating liability in the event of an accident,there is also a need to record all interactions between the aforementioned entities to identify potential instances of negligence that may have played a role in the accident.In this paper,we propose a BlockChain(BC) based framework that integrates the concerned entities in the liability model and provides untampered evidence for liability attribution and adjudication.We first describe the liability attribution model, identify key requirements and describe the adversarial capabilities of entities. Also,we present a detailed description of data contributing to evidence.Our framework uses permissioned BC and partitions the BC to tailor data access to relevant BC participants.Finally,we conduct a security analysis to verify that the identified requirements are met and resilience of our proposed framework to identified attacks.",

Given their financial nature, bugs or vulnerabilities in these programs may lead to catastrophic consequences, as witnessed by recent attacks. Unfortunately, programming smart contracts is a delicate task that requires strong expertise: Ethereum smart contracts are written in Solidity, a dedicated language resembling JavaScript, and shipped over the blockchain in the EVM bytecode format. In order to rigorously verify the security of smart contracts, it is of paramount importance to formalize their semantics as well as the security properties of interest, in particular at the level of the bytecode being executed. In this paper, we present the first complete small-step semantics of EVM bytecode, which we formalize in the F* proof assistant, obtaining executable code that we successfully validate against the official Ethereum test suite. Furthermore, we formally define for the first time a number of central security properties for smart contracts, such as call integrity, atomicity, and independence from miner controlled parameters. This formalization relies on a combination of hyper- and safety properties. Along this work, we identified various mistakes and imprecisions in existing semantics and verification tools for Ethereum smart contracts, thereby demonstrating once more the importance of rigorous semantic foundations for the design of security verification techniques.",

In many instances these challenges are addressed by relying on a dominant cloud computing vendor, but, although commercial cloud vendors provide valuable platforms for data analytics, they can suffer from a lack of transparency, security, and privacy-perservation. Furthermore, reliance on cloud servers prevents applying big data analytics in environments where the computing power is scattered. To address these challenges, a decentralize, secure, and privacy-preserving computing paradigm is proposed to enable an asynchronized cooperative computing process amongst scattered and untrustworthy computing nodes that may have limited computing power and computing intelligence. This paradigm is designed by exploring blockchain, decentralized learning, homomorphic encryption, and software defined networking(SDN) techniques. The performance of the proposed paradigm is evaluated via different scenarios in the simulation section.",

We look at topics such as automatic discovery of peers when a new node joins the network, bandwidth usage of a node, message passing protocols and storage schemas and optimizations for the shared ledger. We believe this is a topic that is often overlooked in works about blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Vulnerabilities and inefficiencies attain a higher significance than ones in a regular open source project because of the rather direct financial implications of these projects. Barring Bitcoin, a network that has been around for nearly 10 years, no other project has substantial documentation for its operational details other than scattered and sparse pages in the source code repositories. Almost all of the content described here has been extracted by studying the source code of the reference implementations of these projects. We evaluate the use of Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables and the Graphene protocol to decrease block propagation times and bandwidth usage of certain messages. We perform realistic simulations that show significant improvements. We provide a complete implementation of Graphene in Geth, Ethereum's main node software and test this implementation against the main Ethereum blockchain. We also crawled the chosen cryptocurrency networks for publicly visible nodes and provide an Autonomous System-level breakdown of these nodes with the end goal of estimating the ease of performing attacks such as BGP hijacks and their impact. Code written for implementing Graphene in Geth, performing various simulations and for other miscellaneous tasks has been uploaded to Github at https://github.com/sunfinite/masters-thesis.",

    "abstract": "Routing attacks remain practically effective in the Internet today as existing countermeasures either fail to provide protection guarantees or are not easily deployable. Blockchain systems are particularly vulnerable to such attacks as they rely on Internet-wide communication to reach consensus. In particular, Bitcoin -the most widely-used cryptocurrency- can be split in half by any AS-level adversary using BGP hijacking. In this paper, we present SABRE, a secure and scalable Bitcoin relay network which relays blocks worldwide through a set of connections that are resilient to routing attacks. SABRE runs alongside the existing peer-to-peer network and is easily deployable. As a critical system, SABRE design is highly resilient and can efficiently handle high bandwidth loads, including Denial of Service attacks. We built SABRE around two key technical insights. First, we leverage fundamental properties of inter-domain routing (BGP) policies to host relay nodes: (i) in locations that are inherently protected against routing attacks; and (ii) on paths that are economically preferred by the majority of Bitcoin clients. These properties are generic and can be used to protect other Blockchain-based systems. Second, we leverage the fact that relaying blocks is communication-heavy, not computation-heavy. This enables us to offload most of the relay operations to programmable network hardware (using the P4 programming language). Thanks to this hardware/software co-design, SABRE nodes operate seamlessly under high load while mitigating the effects of malicious clients. We present a complete implementation of SABRE together with an extensive evaluation. Our results demonstrate that SABRE is effective at securing Bitcoin against routing attacks, even with deployments as small as 6 nodes.",

The public availability of transaction histories offers an opportunity to analyze and compare different cryptocurrencies.

By analyzing the accumulated network growth, we find that, unlike most other networks, these cryptocurrency networks do not always densify over time, and they are changing all the time with relatively low node and edge repetition ratios. Therefore, we then construct separate networks on a monthly basis, trace the changes of typical network characteristics (including degree distribution, degree assortativity, clustering coefficient, and the largest connected component) over time, and compare the three. We find that the degree distribution of these monthly transaction networks cannot be well fitted by the famous power-law distribution, at the same time, different currency still has different network properties, e.g., both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are heavy-tailed with disassortative mixing, however, only the former can be treated as a small world. These network properties reflect the evolutionary characteristics and competitive power of these three cryptocurrencies and provide a foundation for future research.",

Given that such shared results form the basis of inferences drawn, technological solutions designed, and day-to-day policies drafted, it is essential that the computations are validated and trusted.

In particular we address the scalaibility problem by reducing the storage and communication costs using a lossy compression scheme. This framework guarantees not only verifiability of final results, but also the validity of local computations, and its cost-benefit tradeoffs are studied using a synthetic example of training a neural network.",

These bugs are intimately related to the dynamic ordering of contract events, i.e., calls of its functions on the blockchain, and enable potential exploits of millions of USD worth of Ether. Known examples of such bugs and prior techniques to detect them have been restricted to a small number of event orderings, typicall 1 or 2. Our work provides a new formulation of this general class of EO bugs as finding concurrency properties arising in long permutations of such events. The technical challenge in detecting our formulation of EO bugs is the inherent combinatorial blowup in path and state space analysis, even for simple contracts. We propose the first use of partial-order reduction techniques, using happen-before relations extracted automatically for contracts, along with several other optimizations built on a dynamic symbolic execution technique. We build an automatic tool called ETHRACER that requires no hints from users and runs directly on Ethereum bytecode. It flags 7-11% of over ten thousand contracts analyzed in roughly 18.5 minutes per contract, providing compact event traces that human analysts can run as witnesses. These witnesses are so compact that confirmations require only a few minutes of human effort. Half of the flagged contracts have subtle EO bugs, including in ERC-20 contracts that carry hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether. Thus, ETHRACER is effective at detecting a subtle yet dangerous class of bugs which existing tools miss.",

    "abstract": "Since the inception of blockchain and Bitcoin (Nakamoto (2008)), a decentralized-distributed ledger system and its associated cryptocurrency, respectively, the world has witnessed a slew of newer adaptations and applications. Although the original distributed ledger technology (DLT) of blockchain is deemed secure and decentralized, the confirmation of transactions is inefficient by design. Recently adopted, directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based distributed ledgers validate transactions efficiently without the physically and environmentally costly building process of blocks (Lerner (2015)). However, centrally-controlled confirmation against the odds of multiple validation disqualifies the DAG as a decentralized-distributed ledger. In this regard, we introduce an innovative DLT by reconstructing a chain of antichains based on a given DAG-pool of transactions. Each antichain (box) contains distinct nodes whose approved transactions are recursively validated by subsequently augmenting nodes. The boxer node closes the box and keeps the hash of all transactions confirmed by the box-genesis node. Designation of boxers and box-geneses is conditionally randomized for decentralization. The boxes are serially concatenated with recursive confirmation (boxchain) without incurring the cost of box generation. Rewards (boxcoin) are paid to the contributing nodes of the ecosystem whose trust is built on the doubly-secure protocol of confirmation. A value-preserving medium of payment (boxdollar) is among numerous practical applications discussed herein.",

However, AI training relies on highly sensitive and private data which significantly limit their applications and robustness evaluation. Moreover, the data access management after sharing across organization heavily relies on legal restriction, and there is no guarantee in preventing data leaking after sharing. Here, we present Genie, a secure AI platform which allows AI models to be trained on medical data securely. The platform combines the security of Intel Software Guarded eXtensions (SGX), transparency of blockchain technology, and verifiability of open algorithms and source codes. Genie shares insights of genetic and medical data without exposing anyone's raw data. All data is instantly encrypted upon upload and contributed to the models that the user chooses. The usage of the model and the value generated from the genetic and health data will be tracked via a blockchain, giving the data transparent and immutable ownership.",

    "abstract": "The requirement of supporting both latency sensitive and computing intensive Internet of Things (IoT) applications is consistently boosting the necessity for integrating Edge, Fog and Cloud infrastructure. Although there are a number of real-world frameworks attempt to support such integration, they have many limitations from various perspectives including platform independence, security, resource management and multi-application assistance. To address these limitations, we propose a simplified but effective framework, named FogBus for facilitating end-to-end IoT-Fog(Edge)-Cloud integration. FogBus offers a platform independent interface to IoT applications and computing instances for execution and interaction. It not only assists developers in building applications but also helps users in running multiple applications at a time and service providers to manage their resources. In addition, FogBus applies Blockchain, authentication and encryption techniques to secure operations on sensitive data. Because of its lightweight and cross platform software systems, it is easy to deploy, scalable and cost e_cient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by creating a computing environment with it that integrates finger pulse oximeter as IoT devices with Smartphone-based gateway and Raspberry Pi-based Fog nodes for Sleep Apnea analysis. We also run several experiments on this computing environment varying FogBus settings. The experimental results show that different FogBus settings can improve latency, energy, network and CPU usage of the computing infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "With the recent rise of cryptocurrencies' popularity, the security and management of crypto-tokens have become critical. We have witnessed many attacks on users and providers, which have resulted in significant financial losses. To remedy these issues, several wallet solutions have been proposed. However, these solutions often lack either essential security features, usability, or do not allow users to customize their spending rules. In this paper, we propose SmartOTPs, a smart-contract wallet framework that gives a flexible, usable, and secure way of managing crypto-tokens in a self-sovereign fashion. The proposed framework consists of four components (i.e., an authenticator, a client, a hardware wallet, and a smart contract), and it provides 2-factor authentication (2FA) performed in two stages of interaction with the blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first one that utilizes one-time passwords (OTPs) in the setting of the public blockchain. In SmartOTPs, the OTPs are aggregated by a Merkle tree and hash chains whereby for each authentication only a short OTP (e.g., 16B-long) is transferred from the authenticator to the client. Such a novel setting enables us to make a fully air-gapped authenticator by utilizing small QR codes or a few mnemonic words, while additionally offering resilience against quantum cryptanalysis. We have made a proof-of-concept based on the Ethereum platform. Our cost analysis shows that the average cost of a transfer operation is comparable to existing 2FA solutions using smart contracts with multi-signatures.",

In particular DAG ledgers with stochastic attachment mechanisms potentially offer many advantages over blockchain, including scalability and faster transaction speeds. However, the random nature of the attachment mechanism coupled with the requirement of protection against double-spend transactions leaves open the possibility that not all transactions will be eventually validated. Such transactions are said to be orphaned, and will never be validated. Our principal contribution is to propose a simple modification to the attachment mechanism for the Tangle (the IOTA DAG architecture). This modification ensures that all transactions are validated in finite time, and preserves essential features of the popular Monte-Carlo selection algorithm. In order to demonstrate these results we derive a fluid approximation for the Tangle (in the limit of infinite arrival rate) and prove that this fluid model exhibits the desired behavior. We also present simulations which validate the results for finite arrival rates.",

    "abstract": "Recently, an ingenious protocol called Algorand has been proposed to overcome these limitations. Algorand uses an innovative process - called cryptographic sortition - to securely and unpredictably elect a set of voters from the network periodically. These voters are responsible for reaching consensus through a Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol on one block per time, guaranteeing an overwhelming probability of linearity of the blockchain. In this paper, we present a security analysis of Algorand. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first security analysis as well as the first formal study on Algorand. We designed an attack scenario in which a group of malicious users tries to break the protocol, or at least limiting it to a reduced partition of network users, by exploiting a possible security flaw in the messages validation process of the BA. Since the source code or an official simulator for Algorand was not available at the time of our study, we created a simulator (which is available on request) to implement the protocol and assess the feasibility of our attack scenario. Our attack requires the attacker to have a trivial capability of establishing multiple connections with targeted nodes and costs practically nothing to the attacker. Our results show that it is possible to slow down the message validation process on honest nodes, which eventually forces them to choose default values on the consensus; leaving the targeted nodes behind in the chain as compared to the non-attacked nodes. Even though our results are subject to the real implementation assumption, the core concept of our attack remains valid.",

    "abstract": "Modern blockchains, such as Ethereum, enable the execution of so-called smart contracts - programs that are executed across a decentralised network of nodes. As smart contracts become more popular and carry more value, they become more of an interesting target for attackers. In the past few years, several smart contracts have been exploited by attackers. However, a new trend towards a more proactive approach seems to be on the rise, where attackers do not search for vulnerable contracts anymore. Instead, they try to lure their victims into traps by deploying seemingly vulnerable contracts that contain hidden traps. This new type of contracts is commonly referred to as honeypots. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of honeypot smart contracts, by investigating their prevalence, behaviour and impact on the Ethereum blockchain. We develop a taxonomy of honeypot techniques and use this to build HoneyBadger - a tool that employs symbolic execution and well defined heuristics to expose honeypots. We perform a large-scale analysis on more than 2 million smart contracts and show that our tool not only achieves high precision, but is also highly efficient. We identify 690 honeypot smart contracts as well as 240 victims in the wild, with an accumulated profit of more than $90,000 for the honeypot creators. Our manual validation shows that 87% of the reported contracts are indeed honeypots.",

First, we analyze the promises of open science measurement data and point out how Blockchain technology changed the circumstances for data measurement in science projects using sensors. Second, we present an open hardware project capable of securing the integrity of data directly from the source using cryptographic methods. By using inexpensive modular components and open source software, we lower the barrier for participation in open science projects. We show how time series of measurement values using sensors, e.g., temperature, current, and vibration measurements, can be verifiably and immutably stored.

In this paper, we propose DLBC to exploit the computation power of miners for deep learning training as proof of useful work instead of calculating hash values. it distinguishes itself from recent proof of useful work mechanisms by addressing various limitations of them. Specifically, DLBC handles multiple tasks, larger model and training datasets, and introduces a comprehensive ranking mechanism that considers tasks difficulty(e.g., model complexity, network burden, data size, queue length). We also applied DNN-watermark [1] to improve the robustness. In Section V, the average overhead of digital signature is 1.25, 0.001, 0.002 and 0.98 seconds, respectively, and the average overhead of network is 3.77, 3.01, 0.37 and 0.41 seconds, respectively. Embedding a watermark takes 3 epochs and removing a watermark takes 30 epochs. This penalty of removing watermark will prevent attackers from stealing, improving, and resubmitting DL models from honest miners.",

In this paper, we describe a system for simulating how adversarial agents, both economically rational and Byzantine, interact with a blockchain protocol. This system provides statistical estimates for the economic difficulty of an attack and how the presence of certain actors influences protocol-level statistics, such as the expected time to regain liveness. This simulation system is influenced by the design of algorithmic trading and reinforcement learning systems that use explicit modeling of an agent's reward mechanism to evaluate and optimize a fully autonomous agent. We implement and apply this simulation framework to Kadena's Chainweb, a parallelized Proof-of-Work system, that contains complexity in how miner incentive compliance affects security and censorship resistance. We provide the first formal description of Chainweb that is in the literature and use this formal description to motivate our simulation design. Our simulation results include a phase transition in block height growth rate as a function of shard connectivity and empirical evidence that censorship in Chainweb is too costly for rational miners to engage in. We conclude with an outlook on how simulation can guide and optimize protocol development in a variety of contexts, including Proof-of-Stake parameter optimization and peer-to-peer networking design.",

    "abstract": "The recent adoption of blockchain technologies and open permissionless networks suggest the importance of peer-to-peer atomic cross-chain transaction protocols. Users should be able to atomically exchange tokens and assets without depending on centralized intermediaries such as exchanges. Recent peer-to-peer atomic cross-chain swap protocols use hashlocks and timelocks to ensure that participants comply to the protocol. However, an expired timelock could lead to a violation of the all-or-nothing atomicity property. An honest participant who fails to execute a smart contract on time due to a crash failure or network delays at her site might end up losing her assets. Although a crashed participant is the only participant who ends up worse off, current proposals are unsuitable for atomic cross-chain transactions in asynchronous environments where crash failures and network delays are the norm. In this paper, we present AC3WN, the first decentralized all-or-nothing atomic cross-chain commitment protocol. The redeem and refund events of the smart contracts that exchange assets are modeled as conflicting events. An open permissionless network of witnesses is used to guarantee that conflicting events could never simultaneously occur and either all smart contracts in an atomic cross-chain transaction are redeemed or all of them are refunded.",

While in some cases the proof of some utility or service can be proved, the majority of tasks are impossible to verify. In order to deal with such cases, we design Proof-of-Prestige (PoP) - a reward system that can run on top of Proof-of-Stake blockchains. PoP introduces prestige which is a volatile resource and, in contrast to coins, regenerates over time. Prestige can be gained by performing useful work, spent when benefiting from services and directly translates to users minting power. PoP is resistant against Sybil and Collude attacks and can be used to reward workers for completing unverifiable tasks, while keeping the system free for the end-users. We use two exemplar use-cases to showcase the usefulness of PoP and we build a simulator to assess the cryptoeconomic behaviour of the system in terms of prestige transfer between nodes.",

Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform supporting smart contracts. The open nature of blockchain makes the transaction data on Ethereum completely public, and also brings unprecedented opportunities for the transaction network analysis. By taking the realistic rules and features of transaction networks into consideration, we first model the Ethereum transaction network as a Temporal Weighted Multidigraph (TWMDG), where each node is a unique Ethereum account and each edge represents a transaction weighted by amount and assigned with timestamp. Then we define the problem of Temporal Weighted Multidigraph Embedding (T-EDGE) by incorporating both temporal and weighted information of the edges, the purpose being to capture more comprehensive properties of dynamic transaction networks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed embedding method, we conduct experiments of node classification on real-world transaction data collected from Ethereum. Experimental results demonstrate that T-EDGE outperforms baseline embedding methods, indicating that time-dependent walks and multiplicity characteristic of edges are informative and essential for time-sensitive transaction networks.",

An atomic cross-chain swap protocol guarantees; (1) if all parties conform to the protocol, then all assets are exchanged among parties, (2) even if some parties or coalitions of parties deviate from the protocol, no party conforming to the protocol suffers a loss, and (3) no coalition has an incentive to deviate from the protocol. Herlihy [Herlihy, 2018] invented this protocol by using hashed timelock contracts. A cross-chain swap is modeled as a directed graph D = (V,A). Vertex set V denotes a set of parties and arc set A denotes a set of proposed asset transfers. Herlihy's protocol uses the graph topology and signature information to set appropriate hashed timelock contracts. The space complexity of the protocol (i.e., the total number of bits written in the blockchains in a swap) is O(|A|^2). The local time complexity of the protocol (i.e., the maximum execution time of a contract in a swap to transfer the corresponding asset) is O(|V||L|), where L is a feedback vertex set computed by the protocol. We propose a new atomic cross-chain swap protocol which uses only signature information and improves the space complexity to O(|A||V|) and the local time complexity to O(|V|).",

Current proposals, however, require synchrony assumptions to preserve the safety of a channel, leaking to an adversary the exact amount of time needed to control the network for a successful attack. In this paper, we introduce Brick, the first payment channel that remains secure under network asynchrony and concurrently provides correct incentives. The core idea is to incorporate the conflict resolution process within the channel by introducing a rational committee of external parties, called Wardens. Hence, if a party wants to close a channel unilaterally, it can only get the committee's approval for the last valid state. Brick provides sub-second latency because it does not employ heavy-weight consensus. Instead, Brick uses consistent broadcast to announce updates and close the channel, a light-weight abstraction that is powerful enough to preserve safety and liveness to any rational parties. Furthermore, we consider permissioned blockchains, where the additional property of auditability might be desired for regulatory purposes. We introduce Brick+, an off-chain construction that provides auditability on top of Brick without conflicting with its privacy guarantees. We formally define the properties our payment channel construction should fulfill, and prove that both Brick and Brick+ satisfy them. We also design incentives for Brick such that honest and rational behavior aligns. Finally, we provide a reference implementation of the smart contracts in Solidity.",

    "abstract": "Custom tokens are an integral component of decentralized applications (dapps) deployed on Ethereum and other blockchain platforms. For Ethereum, the ERC20 standard is a widely used token interface and is interoperable with many existing dapps, user interface platforms, and popular web applications (e.g., exchange services). An ERC20 security issue, known as the \"multiple withdrawal attack\", was raised on GitHub and has been open since November 2016. The issue concerns ERC20's defined method approve() which was envisioned as a way for token holders to give permission for other users and dapps to withdraw a capped number of tokens. The security issue arises when a token holder wants to adjust the amount of approved tokens from N to M (this could be an increase or decrease). If malicious, a user or dapp who is approved for N tokens can front-run the adjustment transaction to first withdraw N tokens, then allow the approval to be confirmed, and withdraw an additional M tokens. In this paper, we evaluate 10 proposed mitigations for this issues and find that no solution is fully satisfactory. We then propose 2 new solutions that mitigate the attack, one of which fully fulfills constraints of the standard, and the second one shows a general limitation in addressing this issue from ERC20's approve method.",

One of the main topics of interest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy mechanisms, as for example is the case of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into the ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe different strategies to construct Zero Knowledge Range Proofs (ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot in 2001; the one proposed in 2008 by Camenisch et al, and Bulletproofs, proposed in 2017. We also compare these strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since Bulletproofs is the most efficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous schemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not desirable in the context of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and blockchain. In case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, Bulletproofs can also be used to construct generic Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), in the sense that it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only restricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of Proof of Knowledge (PoK). Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs protocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced.",

    "abstract": "Since the transport sector accounts for one of the highest shares of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, several existing proposals state the idea to control the by the transportation sector caused GHG emissions through an Emission Trading Systems (ETS). However, most existing approaches integrate GHG emissions through the fuel consumption and car registration, limiting the tracing of emissions in more complex modes e.g. shared vehicles, shared rides and even public transportation. This paper presents a new design of a user-centric ETS and its implementation as a carbon Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-market (cBSMD). The cBSMD allows for the seamless transactions of token-equivalent GHG emissions when realizing a trip, or an emission trading action as well as the transaction of individual, service or system-wide emission performance data. We demonstrate an instance of the cBSMD implementation for the transactions of an ETS where all travellers receive a certain amount of emission credits in the form of tokens, linked to the GHG price and a total emission cap. Travellers use their tokens each time they emit GHG when travelling in a multi-modal network, purchase tokens for a given trip when they have an insufficient token amount or sell when having a surplus of tokens due to a lower amount of emitted GHG. This instance of cBSMD is then applied to a case-study of 24hours of mobility of 3,186 travellers from Oakville, Ontario, Canada, where we showcase different cBSMD transactions and analyze token usage and emission performance.",

    "abstract": "The emerging parallel chain protocols represent a breakthrough to address the scalability of blockchain. By composing multiple parallel chain instances, the whole systems' throughput can approach the network capacity. How to coordinate different chains' blocks and to construct them into a global ordering is critical to the performance of parallel chain protocol. However, the existed solutions use either the global synchronization clock with the single-chain bottleneck or pre-defined ordering sequences with distortion of blocks' causality to order blocks. In addition, the prior ordering methods rely on that honest participants faithfully follow the ordering protocol, but remain silent for any denial of ordering (DoR) attack. On the other hand, the conflicting transactions included into the global block sequence will make Simple Payment Verification (SPV) difficult. Clients usually need to store a full record of transactions to distinguish the conflictions and tell whether transactions are confirmed. However, the requirement for a full record will greatly hinder blockchains' application, especially for mobile scenarios. In this technical report, we propose Eunomia, which leverages logical clock and fine-grained UTXO sharding to realize a simple, efficient, secure and permissionless parallel chain protocol. By observing the characteristics of the parallel chain, we find the blocks ordering issue in parallel chain has many similarities with the event ordering in the distributed system. Eunomia thus adopts \"virtual\" logical clock, which is optimized to have the minimum protocol overhead and runs in a distributed way. In addition, Eunomia combines the mining incentive with block ordering, providing incentive compatibility against DoR attack. What's more, the fine-grained UTXO sharding does well solve the conflicting transactions in parallel chain and is shown to be SPV-friendly.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of today's supply chain, organised in several tiers and including many companies located in different countries, makes it challenging to assess the history and integrity of procured physical parts, and to make organisations really accountable for their conduct. This enables malicious practices like counterfeiting and insertion of back doors, which are extremely dangerous, especially in supply chains of physical parts for industrial control systems used in critical infrastructures, where a country and human lives can be put at risk. This paper aims at mitigating these issues by proposing an approach where procured parts are uniquely identified and tracked along the chain, across multiple sites, to detect tampering. Our solution is based on consortium blockchain and smart contract technologies, hence it is decentralised, highly available and provides strong guarantees on the integrity of stored data and executed business logic. The unique identification of parts along the chain is implemented by using physically unclonable functions (PUFs) as tamper-resistant IDs. We first define the threat model of an adversary interested in tampering with physical products along the supply chain, then provide the design of the tracking system that implements the proposed anti-counterfeiting approach. We present a security analysis of the tracking system against the designated threat model and a prototype evaluation to show its technical feasibility and assess its effectiveness in counterfeit mitigation. Finally, we discuss several key practical aspects concerning our solution ad its integration with real supply chains.",

Blockchain (BC) finds its efficient application in IoT platform to preserve the five basic cryptographic primitives, such as confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, availability and non-repudiation. Conventional adoption of BC in IoT platform causes high energy consumption, delay and computational overhead which are not appropriate for various resource constrained IoT devices. This work proposes a machine learning (ML) based smart access control framework in a public and a private BC for a smart city application which makes it more efficient as compared to the existing IoT applications. The proposed IoT based smart city architecture adopts BC technology for preserving all the cryptographic security and privacy issues. Moreover, BC has very minimal overhead on IoT platform as well. This work investigates the existing threat models and critical access control issues which handle multiple permissions of various nodes and detects relevant inconsistencies to notify the corresponding nodes. Comparison in terms of all security issues with existing literature shows that the proposed architecture is competitively efficient in terms of security access control.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a virtual services marketplace, called Nubo, designed to connect buyers of virtual services (or tenants) with providers of those services on a cloud computing platform. The marketplace is implemented as a collection of distributed microservices along with a marketplace portal that runs as a Web application. The heart of Nubo is the Saranyu tenant and service management microservice. Saranyu is a decentralized application (dApp) built on top of the J.P. Morgan Quorum blockchain. Tenant and service accounts are represented as static (nonnegotiable) smart contracts written in the Solidity language. Quorum provides a tamper evident and tamper resistant distributed ledger, whereby multiple cloud and service providers can co-operate to provide service resources to tenants in a trustworthy fashion. Services offer resources consisting of a collection of attributes describing what the tenant can consume, and tenants subscribe to service resources through the Nubo Marketplace portal. The Service Manager microservice provides multitenant support for containerized services built for deployment and orchestration using Docker that were originally not designed to be managed through Saranyu. We discuss our design goals for Nubo, describe the overall architecture, discuss some details on how Saranyu uses the blockchain and smart contracts, and provide comprehensive performance and scalability data measured on the Saranyu REST API. The results indicate Saranyu is competitive with published results for comparable operations on the Havana release of OpenStack Keystone, but Saranyu provides a much richer collection of tenant and service management functionality than Keystone.",

So far, most existing solutions focus on an honest-but-curious server, while security designs against a malicious server have not drawn enough attention. A few recent works have attempted to construct verifiable SSE that enables the data owner to verify the integrity of search results. Nevertheless, these verification mechanisms are highly dependent on specific SSE schemes, and fail to support complex queries. A general verification mechanism is desired that can be applied to all SSE schemes. In this work, instead of concentrating on a central server, we explore the potential of the smart contract, an emerging blockchain-based decentralized technology, and construct decentralized SSE schemes where the data owner can receive correct search results with assurance without worrying about potential wrongdoings of a malicious server. We study both public and private blockchain environments and propose two designs with a trade-off between security and efficiency. To better support practical applications, the multi-user setting of SSE is further investigated where the data owner allows authenticated users to search keywords in shared documents. We implement prototypes of our two designs and present experiments and evaluations to demonstrate the practicability of our decentralized SSE schemes.",

    "abstract": "Micropayments are increasingly being adopted by a large number of applications. However, processing micropayments individually can be expensive, with transaction fees exceeding the payment value itself. By aggregating these small transactions into a few larger ones, and using cryptocurrencies, today's decentralized probabilistic micropayment schemes can reduce these fees. Unfortunately, existing solutions force micropayments to be issued sequentially, thus to support fast issuance rates a customer needs to create a large number of escrows, which bloats the blockchain. Moreover, these schemes incur a large computation and bandwidth overhead, which limit their applicability in large-scale systems. In this paper, we propose MicroCash, the first decentralized probabilistic framework that supports concurrent micropayments. MicroCash introduces a novel escrow setup that enables a customer to concurrently issue payment tickets at a fast rate using a single escrow. MicroCash is also cost effective because it allows for ticket exchange using only one round of communication, and it aggregates the micropayments using a lottery protocol that requires only secure hashing. Our experiments show that MicroCash can process thousands of tickets per second, which is around 1.7-4.2x times the rate of a state-of-the-art sequential micropayment system. Moreover, MicroCash supports any ticket issue rate over any period using only one escrow, while the sequential scheme would need more than 1000 escrows per second to permit high rates. This enables our system to further reduce transaction fees and data on the blockchain by around 50%.",

    "abstract": "Permissionless blockchains protocols such as Bitcoin are inherently limited in transaction throughput and latency. Current efforts to address this key issue focus on off-chain payment channels that can be combined in a Payment-Channel Network (PCN) to enable an unlimited number of payments without requiring to access the blockchain other than to register the initial and final capacity of each channel. While this approach paves the way for low latency and high throughput of payments, its deployment in practice raises several privacy concerns as well as technical challenges related to the inherently concurrent nature of payments, such as race conditions and deadlocks, that have been understudied so far. In this work, we lay the foundations for privacy and concurrency in PCNs, presenting a formal definition in the Universal Composability framework as well as practical and provably secure solutions. In particular, we present Fulgor and Rayo. Fulgor is the first payment protocol for PCNs that provides provable privacy guarantees for PCNs and is fully compatible with the Bitcoin scripting system. However, Fulgor is a blocking protocol and therefore prone to deadlocks of concurrent payments as in currently available PCNs. Instead, Rayo is the first protocol for PCNs that enforces non-blocking progress (i.e., at least one of the concurrent payments terminates). We show through a new impossibility result that non-blocking progress necessarily comes at the cost of weaker privacy. At the core of Fulgor and Rayo is Multi-Hop HTLC, a new smart contract, compatible with the Bitcoin scripting system, that provides conditional payments while reducing running time and communication overhead with respect to previous approaches.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine State Machine Replication (SMR) is a long studied topic that received increasing attention recently with the advent of blockchains as companies are trying to scale them to hundreds of nodes. Byzantine SMRs try to increase throughput by either reducing the latency of consensus instances that they run sequentially or by reducing the number of replicas that send messages to others in order to reduce the network usage. Unfortunately, the former approach makes use of resources in burst whereas the latter requires CPU-intensive authentication mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a new Byzantine SMR called Dispel (Distributed Pipeline) that allows any node to distributively start new consensus instances whenever they detect sufficient resources locally. We evaluate the performance of Dispel within a single datacenter and across up to 380 machines over 3 continents by comparing it against four other SMRs. On 128 nodes, Dispel speeds up HotStuff, the Byzantine fault tolerant SMR being integrated within Facebook's blockchain, by more than 12 times. In addition, we also test Dispel under isolated and correlated failures and show that the Dispel distributed design is more robust than HotStuff. Finally, we evaluate Dispel in a cryptocurrency application with Bitcoin transactions and show that this SMR is not the bottleneck.",

    "abstract": "Though voting-based consensus algorithms in Blockchain outperform proof-based ones in energy- and transaction-efficiency, they are prone to incur wrong elections and bribery elections. The former originates from the uncertainties of candidates' capability and availability; and the latter comes from the egoism of voters and candidates. Hence, in this paper, we propose an uncertainty- and collusion-proof voting consensus mechanism, including the selection pressure-based voting consensus algorithm and the trustworthiness evaluation algorithm. The first algorithm can decrease the side effects of candidates' uncertainties, lowering wrong elections while trading off the balance between efficiency and fairness in electing miners. The second algorithm adopts an incentive compatible scoring rule to evaluate the trustworthiness of voting, motivating voters to report true beliefs on candidates by making egoism in consistent with altruism so as to avoid bribery elections. A salient feature of our work is theoretically analyzing the proposed voting consensus mechanism by the large deviation theory. Our analysis provides not only the voting failure rate of a candidate but also its decay speed, based on which the concepts of {\\it the effective selection valve} and {\\it the effective expectation of merit} are introduced to help the system designer to determine the optimal voting standard and guide a candidate to behave in an optimal way for lowering the voting failure rate.",

    "abstract": "Permissionless blockchains offer many advantages but also have significant limitations including high latency. This prevents their use in important scenarios such as retail payments, where merchants should approve payments fast. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this problem by moving transactions off the chain. However, such Layer-2 solutions have their own problems: payment channels require a separate deposit towards each merchant and thus significant locked-in funds from customers; payment hubs require very large operator deposits that depend on the number of customers; and side-chains require trusted validators. In this paper, we propose Snappy, a novel solution that enables recipients, like merchants, to safely accept fast payments. In Snappy, all payments are on the chain, while small customer collaterals and moderate merchant collaterals act as payment guarantees. Besides receiving payments, merchants also act as statekeepers who collectively track and approve incoming payments using majority voting. In case of a double-spending attack, the victim merchant can recover lost funds either from the collateral of the malicious customer or a colluding statekeeper (merchant). Snappy overcomes the main problems of previous solutions: a single customer collateral can be used to shop with many merchants; merchant collaterals are independent of the number of customers; and validators do not have to be trusted. Our Ethereum prototype shows that safe, fast (<2 seconds) and cheap payments are possible on existing blockchains.",

However, there are major challenges in scaling up the throughput of such networks. Lightning network and Spider network are alternates that build bidirectional payment channels on top of cryptocurrency networks using smart contracts, to enable fast transactions that bypass the Blockchain. In this paper, we study the problem of routing transactions in such a payment processing network. We first propose a Stochastic model to study such a system, as opposed to a fluid model that is studied in the literature. Each link in such a model is a two-sided queue, and unlike classical queues, such queues are not stable unless there is an external control. We propose a notion of stability for the payment processing network consisting of such two-sided queues using the notion of on-chain rebalancing. We then characterize the capacity region and propose a throughput optimal algorithm that stabilizes the system under any load within the capacity region. The stochastic model enables us to study closed loop policies, which typically have better queuing/delay performance than the open loop policies (or static split rules) studied in the literature. We investigate this through simulations.",

This work proposes to utilize blockchain technology to realize a trusted and transparent decentralized marketplace for contract compliance for trading IoT data streams generated by battery-operated IoT devices in real-time. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) we propose an autonomous blockchain-based marketplace equipped with essential functionalities such as agreement framework, pricing model and rating mechanism to create an effective marketplace framework without involving a mediator, (2) we propose a mechanism for selection and allocation of buyers' demands on seller's devices under quality and battery constraints. We present a proof-of-concept implementation in Ethereum to demonstrate the feasibility of the framework. We investigated the impact of buyer's demand on the battery drainage of the IoT devices under different scenarios through extensive simulations. Our results show that this approach is viable and benefits the seller and buyer for creating a sustainable marketplace model for trading IoT data in real-time from battery-powered IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin's single leader consensus protocol (Nakamoto consensus) suffers from significant transaction throughput and network scalability issues due to the computational requirements of it Proof-of-Work (PoW) based leader selection strategy. To overcome this, committee-based approaches (e.g., Elastico) that partition the outstanding transaction set into shards and (randomly) select multiple committees to process these transactions in parallel have been proposed and have become very popular. However, by design these committee or shard-based blockchain solutions are easily vulnerable to the Sybil attacks, where an adversary can easily compromise/manipulate the consensus protocol if it has enough computational power to generate multiple Sybil committee members (by generating multiple valid node identifiers). Despite the straightforward nature of these attacks, they have not been systematically analyzed. In this paper, we fill this research gap by modelling and analyzing Sybil attacks in a representative and popular shard-based protocol called Elastico. We show that the PoW technique used for identifier or ID generation in the initial phase of the protocol is vulnerable to Sybil attacks, and a node with high hash-power can generate enough Sybil IDs to successfully compromise Elastico. We analytically derive conditions for two different categories of Sybil attacks and perform numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results under different network and protocol parameters.",

    "abstract": "Payment channel networks provide a fast and scalable solution to relay funds, acting as a second layer to slower and less scalable blockchain protocols. In this paper, we present an accessible, low-cost attack in which the attacker paralyzes multiple payment network channels for several days. The attack is based on overloading channels with requests that are kept unresolved until their expiration time. Reaching the maximum allowed unresolved requests (HTLCs) locks the channel for new payments. The attack is in fact inherent to the way off-chain networks are constructed, since limits on the number of unresolved payments are derived from limits on the blockchain. We consider three main versions of the attack: one in which the attacker attempts to block as many high liquidity channels as possible, one in which it disconnects as many pairs of nodes as it can, and one in which it tries to isolate individual nodes from the network. We evaluate the costs of these attacks on Bitcoin's Lightning Network and compare how changes in the network have affected the cost of attack. Specifically, we consider how recent changes to default parameters in each of the main Lightning implementations contribute to the attacks. As we evaluate the attacks, we also look at statistics on parameters in the Lightning Network, which are of independent interest and compare the various implementations of Lightning nodes. Finally, we suggest mitigation techniques that make these attacks much harder to carry out.",

IoT domain is one of such applications, which can utilize cryptocur-rencies for micro payments without compromising their payment privacy.

The payment channel networks is one of the proposed solutions to address these issue where nodes establish payment channels among themselves without writing on blockchain. IoT devices can benefit from such payment networks as long as they are capable of sustaining their overhead. Payment channel networks pose unique characteristics as far as the routing problem is concerned. Specifically, they should stay balanced to have a sustainable network for maintaining payments for longer times, which is crucial for IoT devices once they are deployed.In this paper, we present a payment channel network design that aims to keep the channels balanced by using a common weight policy across the network. We additionally propose using multi-point connections to nodes for each IoT device for unbalanced payment scenarios. The experiment results show that we can keep the channels in the network more equally balanced compared to the minimal fee approach. In addition, multiple connections from IoT devices to nodes increase the success ratio significantly.",

    "abstract": "Many proofs of concept blockchain applications built using Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain platform, have recently been transformed into production. However, the performance provided by Hyperledger Fabric is of significant concern for enterprises due to steady growth in network usage. Hence, in this paper, we study the performance achieved in a Fabric network using vertical scaling (i.e., by adding more vCPUs) and horizontal scaling (i.e., by adding more nodes) techniques. We observe that network scales very poorly with both of these techniques. With vertical scaling, due to serial execution of validation & commit phases of transactions, the allocated vCPUs are underutilized. With horizontal scaling, due to redundant work between nodes, allocated resources are wasted though it is utilized. Further, we identify these techniques to be unsuited for dynamically scaling a network quickly to mitigate an overload situation, and hence, it results in a 30% drop in the performance. To increase the CPU utilization and hence the performance, we re-architect Fabric to enable pipelined execution of validation & commit phases by introducing dirty state management using a trie data structure. Additionally, we facilitated the validation phase to validate transactions in parallel by introducing a waiting-transactions dependency graph. To avoid redundant work performed between nodes and to quickly scale up a network, we propose a new type of peer node called sparse peer, which selective commits transactions. Overall, we improved the throughput by 3x and reduced the time taken to scale up a network by 96%.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of payment channels and their extensions (e.g., state channels) provides a promising scalability solution for blockchains which allows untrusting parties to transact off-chain and resolve potential disputes via on-chain smart contracts. To protect participants who have no constant access to the blockchain, a watching service named as watchtower is proposed -- a third-party entity obligated to monitor channel states (on behalf of the participants) and correct them on-chain if necessary. Unfortunately, currently proposed watchtower schemes suffer from multiple security and efficiency drawbacks. In this paper, we explore the design space behind watchtowers. We propose a novel watching service named as fail-safe watchtowers. In contrast to prior proposed watching services, our fail-safe watchtower does not watch on-chain smart contracts constantly. Instead, it only sends a single on-chain message periodically confirming or denying the final states of channels being closed. Our watchtowers can easily handle a large number of channels, are privacy-preserving, and fail-safe tolerating multiple attack vectors. Furthermore, we show that watchtowers (in general) may be an option economically unjustified for multiple payment scenarios and we introduce a simple, yet powerful concept of short-lived assertions which can mitigate misbehaving parties in these scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The EOSIO blockchain, one of the representative Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchain platforms, has grown rapidly recently. Meanwhile, a number of vulnerabilities and high-profile attacks against top EOSIO DApps and their smart contracts have also been discovered and observed in the wild, resulting in serious financial damages. Most of EOSIO's smart contracts are not open-sourced and they are typically compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) bytecode, thus making it challenging to analyze and detect the presence of possible vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose EOSAFE, the first static analysis framework that can be used to automatically detect vulnerabilities in EOSIO smart contracts at the bytecode level. Our framework includes a practical symbolic execution engine for Wasm, a customized library emulator for EOSIO smart contracts, and four heuristics-driven detectors to identify the presence of four most popular vulnerabilities in EOSIO smart contracts. Experiment results suggest that EOSAFE achieves promising results in detecting vulnerabilities, with an F1-measure of 98%. We have applied EOSAFE to all active 53,666 smart contracts in the ecosystem (as of November 15, 2019). Our results show that over 25% of the smart contracts are vulnerable. We further analyze possible exploitation attempts against these vulnerable smart contracts and identify 48 in-the-wild attacks (25 of them have been confirmed by DApp developers), resulting in financial loss of at least 1.7 million USD.",

For small-scale farming, the ability to accurately capture these records plays a critical role in formalizing and digitizing the agriculture industry. Reliable exchange of these record through a trusted platform could unlock critical and valuable insights to different stakeholders across the value chain in agriculture eco-system. Lately, there has been increasing attention on digitization of small scale farming with the objective of providing farm-level transparency, accountability, visibility, access to farm loans, etc. using these farm records. However, most solutions proposed so far have the shortcoming of providing detailed, reliable and trusted small-scale farm digitization information in real time. To address these challenges, we present a system, called Agribusiness Digital Wallet (ADW), which leverages blockchain to formalize the interactions and enable seamless data flow in small-scale farming ecosystem. Utilizing instrumentation of farm tractors, we demonstrate the ability to utilize farm activities to create trusted electronic field records (EFR) with automated valuable insights. Using ADW, we processed several thousands of small-scale farm-level activity events for which we also performed automated farm boundary detection of a number of farms in different geographies.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid popularity of blockchain, decentralized human intelligence tasks (HITs) are proposed to crowdsource human knowledge without relying on vulnerable third-party platforms. However, the inherent limits of blockchain cause decentralized HITs to face a few \"new\" challenges. For example, the confidentiality of solicited data turns out to be the sine qua non, though it was an arguably dispensable property in the centralized setting. To ensure the \"new\" requirement of data privacy, existing decentralized HITs use generic zero-knowledge proof frameworks (e.g. SNARK), but scarcely perform well in practice, due to the inherently expensive cost of generality. We present a practical decentralized protocol for HITs, which also achieves the fairness between requesters and workers. At the core of our contributions, we avoid the powerful yet highly-costly generic zk-proof tools and propose a special-purpose scheme to prove the quality of encrypted data. By various non-trivial statement reformations, proving the quality of encrypted data is reduced to efficient verifiable decryption, thus making decentralized HITs practical. Along the way, we rigorously define the ideal functionality of decentralized HITs and then prove the security due to the ideal-real paradigm. We further instantiate our protocol to implement a system called Dragoon, an instance of which is deployed atop Ethereum to facilitate an image annotation task used by ImageNet. Our evaluations demonstrate its practicality: the on-chain handling cost of Dragoon is even less than the handling fee of Amazon's Mechanical Turk for the same ImageNet HIT.",

This paper proposes a vision for an Internet of Mobile Energy (IoME), where energy and information flow seamlessly across the power and transport sectors to enhance the grid stability and end user welfare. Energy predictions that drive the price signals are used to guide electric vehicle mobility decisions, which in turn underpin the prediction of mobility patterns and future energy predictions. We propose an information architecture for IoME that incorporates data observations across all participants, a blockchain framework for data transmissions, and machine learning for energy and mobility predictions. We present an example scenario that details the seamless and closed loop information flow across the energy and transport sectors, along with a blockchain design and transaction vocabulary for trusted decentralised transactions.

    "abstract": "Blockchain and other forms of distributed ledger technology (DLT) provide an opportunity to integrate digital information, management, and contracts to increase trust and collaboration within the construction industry. DLT enables direct peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by providing an immutable and transparent record of these transactions. Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and automation on the transaction level, through the use of smart contracts, which are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by 1) reviewing and categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, 2) providing an overview of DLT and its design options, 3) proposing an integrated framework to match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and 4) analysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case categories and proposed decision framework can guide future implementers toward more connected and structured thinking between the technological properties of DLT and use cases in construction.",

    "abstract": "Although almost all information about Smart Contract addresses is shared via websites, emails, or other forms of digital communication, Blockchains and distributed ledger technology are unable to establish secure bindings between websites and corresponding Smart Contracts. For a user, it is impossible to differentiate whether a website links to a legitimate Smart Contract set up by owners of a business or to an illicit contract aiming to steal users' funds. Surprisingly, current attempts to solve this issue mostly comprise of information redundancy, e.g., displaying contract addresses multiple times in varying forms of images and texts. These processes are burdensome, as the user is responsible for verifying the correctness of an address. More importantly, they do not address the core issue, as the contract itself does not contain information about its authenticity. To solve current issues for these applications and increase security, we propose a solution that facilitates publicly issued SSL/TLS-certificates of Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) to ensure the authenticity of Smart Contracts and their owners. Our approach combines on-chain identity assertion utilizing signatures from the respective certificate and off-chain authentication of the Smart Contract stored on the Blockchain. This approach allows to tackle the aforementioned issue and further enables applications such as the identification of consortia members in permissioned networks. The system is open and transparent, as the only requirement for usage is ownership of an SSL/TLS-certificate. To enable privacy-preserving authenticated Smart Contracts, we allow one-way and two-way binding between website and contract. Further, low creation and maintenance costs, a widely accepted public key infrastructure and user empowerment will drive potential adaption of Ethereum Authenticated Smart Contracts (AuthSC).",

To this purpose, we review the current and emerging spectrum and technology opportunities that SCPs can use for neutral host deployments.

Among asynchronous, randomized, and signature-free implementations, the protocols of Most\\'efaoui et al. (PODC 2014 and JACM 2015) represent a landmark result, which has been extended later and taken up in practical systems. The protocols achieve optimal resilience and takes, in expectation, only a constant expected number of rounds of quadratic message complexity. Randomization is provided through a common-coin primitive. In traditional consensus protocols, all involved processes adhere to a global, symmetric failure model, typically only defined by bounds on the number of faulty processes. Motivated by applications to blockchains, however, more flexible trust assumptions have recently been considered. In particular, with asymmetric trust, a process is free to choose which other processes it trusts and which ones might collude against it. This paper revisits the optimal asynchronous protocol of Most\\'efaoui et al. and shows how to realize it with asymmetric trust. The paper starts by pointing out in detail why some versions of this protocol may violate liveness. Then it proposes a fix for the protocol that does not affect its properties, but lets it regain the simplicity of its original version (PODC 2014). At the same time, the paper shows how to realize randomized signature-free asynchronous Byzantine consensus with asymmetric quorums. This results in an optimal consensus protocol with subjective, asymmetric trust and constant expected running time. It is suitable for applications to blockchains, for instance.",

Since using centralized architectures comes at the expense of trusting an authority, it has several inherent drawbacks, including vulnerability to security attacks, lack of data privacy, and unauthorized data manipulation. Hence, a new decentralized approach is crucial to remedy these drawbacks. One of the most promising technologies which is widely used to provide decentralization is blockchain. Additionally, to ease the burden of communication overhead and computational power on resource-constrained IoT devices, fog computing can be exploited to decrease communication latency and provide better network scalability.

All participant nodes in the network are blocked until they receive a proposal from the primary node to begin the consensus process.Therefore, an honest but slack node (with limited bandwidth) can adversely affect the performance when selected as primary. Hermes decreases protocol dependency on the primary node and minimizes transmission delay induced by the slack primary while keeping low message complexity and latency. Hermes achieves these performance improvements by relaxing strong BFT agreement (safety) guarantees only for a specific type of Byzantine faults (also called equivocated faults). Interestingly, we show that in Hermes equivocating by a Byzantine primary is unlikely, expensive and ineffective. Therefore, the safety of Hermes is comparable to the general BFT consensus. We deployed and tested Hermes on 190 Amazon EC2 instances. In these tests, Hermes's performance was comparable to the state-of-the-art BFT protocol for blockchains (when the network size is large) in the absence of slack nodes. Whereas, in the presence of slack nodes Hermes out performed the state-of-the-art BFT protocol by more than 4x in terms of throughput as well as 15x in terms of latency.",

Several re-entrancy attacks that aim to steal Ether, the cryptocurrency used in Ethereum, stored in deployed smart contracts have been found in the recent years. A countermeasure to such attacks is based on dynamic analysis that executes the smart contracts themselves, but it requires the spending of Ether and knowledge of attack patterns for analysis in advance. In this paper, we present a static analysis tool named \\textit{RA (Re-entrancy Analyzer)}, a combination of symbolic execution and equivalence checking by a satisfiability modulo theories solver to analyze smart contract vulnerabilities to re-entrancy attacks. In contrast to existing tools, RA supports analysis of inter-contract behaviors by using only the Etherum Virtual Machine bytecodes of target smart contracts, i.e., even without prior knowledge of attack patterns and without spending Ether. Furthermore, RA can verify existence of vulnerabilities to re-entrancy attacks without execution of smart contracts and it does not provide false positives and false negatives. We also present an implementation of RA to evaluate its performance in analyzing the vulnerability of deployed smart contracts to re-entrancy attacks and show that RA can precisely determine which smart contracts are vulnerable.",

Firstly, GossipSub's mesh construction implements an eager push model keeps the fan-out of the pubsub delivery low and balances excessive bandwidth consumption and fast message propagation throughout the mesh. Secondly, through gossip dissemination, GossipSub realises a lazy-pull model to reach nodes far-away or outside the mesh. Thirdly, through constant observation, nodes maintain a score profile for the peers they are connected to, allowing them to choose the most well-behaved nodes to include in the mesh. Finally, and most importantly, a number of tailor-made mitigation strategies designed specifically for these three components make GossipSub resilient against the most challenging Sybil-based attacks.

    "abstract": "Federated learning enables the development of a machine learning model among collaborating agents without requiring them to share their underlying data. However, malicious agents who train on random data, or worse, on datasets with the result classes inverted, can weaken the combined model. BlockFLow is an accountable federated learning system that is fully decentralized and privacy-preserving. Its primary goal is to reward agents proportional to the quality of their contribution while protecting the privacy of the underlying datasets and being resilient to malicious adversaries. Specifically, BlockFLow incorporates differential privacy, introduces a novel auditing mechanism for model contribution, and uses Ethereum smart contracts to incentivize good behavior. Unlike existing auditing and accountability methods for federated learning systems, our system does not require a centralized test dataset, sharing of datasets between the agents, or one or more trusted auditors; it is fully decentralized and resilient up to a 50% collusion attack in a malicious trust model. When run on the public Ethereum blockchain, BlockFLow uses the results from the audit to reward parties with cryptocurrency based on the quality of their contribution. We evaluated BlockFLow on two datasets that offer classification tasks solvable via logistic regression models. Our results show that the resultant auditing scores reflect the quality of the honest agents' datasets. Moreover, the scores from dishonest agents are statistically lower than those from the honest agents. These results, along with the reasonable blockchain costs, demonstrate the effectiveness of BlockFLow as an accountable federated learning system.",

    "abstract": "This paper opts to mitigate the energy-inefficiency of the Blockchain Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm by rationally repurposing the power spent during the mining process. The original PoW mining scheme is designed to consider one block at a time and assign a reward to the first place winner of a computation race. To reduce the mining-related energy consumption, we propose to compensate the computation effort of the runner(s)-up of a mining round, by granting them exclusivity of solving the upcoming block in the next round. This will considerably reduce the number of competing nodes in the next round and consequently, the consumed energy. Our proposed scheme divides time into epochs, where each comprises two mining rounds; in the first one, all network nodes can participate in the mining process, whereas in the second round only runners-up can take part. Thus, the overall mining energy consumption can be reduced to nearly $50\\%$. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme is the first to considerably improve the energy consumption of the original PoW algorithm. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our scheme in reducing energy consumption, the probability of fork occurrences, the level of mining centralization presented in the original PoW algorithm, and the effect of transaction censorship attack.",

    "abstract": "To enable high-performance and scalable blockchains, we need to step away from traditional consensus-based fully-replicated designs. One direction is to explore the usage of sharding in which we partition the managed dataset over many shards that independently operate as blockchains. Sharding requires an efficient fault-tolerant primitive for the ordering and execution of multi-shard transactions, however. In this work, we seek to design such a primitive suitable for distributed ledger networks with high transaction throughput. To do so, we propose Cerberus, a set of minimalistic primitives for processing single-shard and multi-shard UTXO-like transactions. Cerberus aims at maximizing parallel processing at shards while minimizing coordination within and between shards. First, we propose Core-Cerberus, that uses strict environmental requirements to enable simple yet powerful multi-shard transaction processing. In our intended UTXO-environment, Core-Cerberus will operate perfectly with respect to all transactions proposed and approved by well-behaved clients, but does not provide any guarantees for other transactions. To also support more general-purpose environments, we propose two generalizations of Core-Cerberus: we propose Optimistic-Cerberus, a protocol that does not require any additional coordination phases in the well-behaved optimistic case, while requiring intricate coordination when recovering from attacks; and we propose Pessimistic-Cerberus, a protocol that adds sufficient coordination to the well-behaved case of Core-Cerberus, allowing it to operate in a general-purpose fault-tolerant environments without significant costs to recover from attacks. Finally, we compare the three protocols, showing their potential scalability and high transaction throughput in practical environments.",

The passive DNS data collection process creates a database containing various DNS data elements, some of which are personal and need to be protected to preserve the privacy of the end users. To this end, we propose the use of distributed ledger technology. We use Hyperledger Fabric to create a permissioned blockchain, which only authorized entities can access. The proposed solution supports queries for storing and retrieving data from the blockchain ledger, allowing the use of the passive DNS database for further analysis, e.g. for the identification of malicious domain names. Additionally, it effectively protects the DNS personal data from unauthorized entities, including the administrators that can act as potential malicious insiders, and allows only the data owners to perform queries over these data. We evaluated our proposed solution by creating a proof-of-concept experimental setup that passively collects DNS data from a network and then uses the distributed ledger technology to store the data in an immutable ledger, thus providing a full historical overview of all the records.",

For example, several supply-chain use-cases may benefit from transparent asset tracking and automated processes using smart contracts. Several real-world deployments exist where the transparency aspect of a blockchain is both an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time. The exposure of assets and business interaction represent critical risks. However, there are typically no confidentiality guarantees to protect the smart contract logic as well as the processed data. Trusted execution environments (TEE) are an emerging technology available in both edge or mobile-grade processors (e.g., Arm TrustZone) and server-grade processors (e.g., Intel SGX). TEEs shield both code and data from malicious attackers. This practical experience report presents TZ4Fabric, an extension of Hyperledger Fabric to leverage Arm TrustZone for the secure execution of smart contracts. Our design minimizes the trusted computing base executed by avoiding the execution of a whole Hyperledger Fabric node inside the TEE, which continues to run in untrusted environment. Instead, we restrict it to the execution of only the smart contract. The TZ4Fabric prototype exploits the open-source OP-TEE framework, as it supports deployments on cheap low-end devices (e.g., Raspberry Pis). Our experimental results highlight the performance trade-off due to the additional security guarantees provided by Arm TrustZone. TZ4Fabric will be released as open-source.",

Existing centralized access control schemes suffer from the limitations of single point of failure, low reliability and poor scalability. This paper therefore proposes a distributed and reliable access control framework for smart cities by combining the blockchain smart contract technology and the Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model. The framework consists of one Policy Management Contract (PMC) for managing the ABAC policies, one Subject Attribute Management Contract (SAMC) for managing the attributes of subjects (i.e., entities accessing resources), one Object Attribute Management Contract (OAMC) for managing the attributes of objects (i.e., resources being accessed), and one Access Control Contract (ACC) for performing the access control. To show the feasibility of the proposed framework, we construct a local private Ethereum blockchain system to implement the four smart contracts and also conduct experiments to evaluate the monetary cost as well as to compare the proposed framework with an existing Access Control List (ACL)-based scheme. The experimental results show that although the proposed scheme consumes more money than the ACL-based scheme at the deployment stage, it introduces less monetary cost during the system running especially for large-scale smart cities.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains are intended to be immutable, so an attacker who is able to delete transactions through a chain reorganization (a malicious reorg) can perform a profitable double-spend attack. We study the rate at which an attacker can execute reorgs in the Tezos Proof-of-Stake protocol. As an example, an attacker with 40% of the staking power is able to execute a 20-block malicious reorg at an average rate of once per day, and the attack probability increases super-linearly as the staking power grows beyond 40%. Moreover, an attacker of the Tezos protocol knows in advance when an attack opportunity will arise, and can use this knowledge to arrange transactions to double-spend. We show that in particular cases, the Tezos protocol can be adjusted to protect against deep reorgs. For instance, we demonstrate protocol parameters that reduce the rate of length-20 reorg opportunities for a 40% attacker by two orders of magnitude. We also observe a trade-off between optimizing for robustness to deep reorgs (costly deviations that may be net profitable because they enable double-spends) and robustness to selfish mining (mining deviations that result in typically short reorgs that are profitable even without double-spends). That is, the parameters that optimally protect against one make the other attack easy. Finally, we develop a method that monitors the Tezos blockchain health with respect to malicious reorgs using only publicly available information.",

    "abstract": "Recent attacks exploiting errors in smart contract code had devastating consequences thereby questioning the benefits of this technology. It is currently highly challenging to fix errors and deploy a patched contract in time. Instant patching is especially important since smart contracts are always online due to the distributed nature of blockchain systems. They also manage considerable amounts of assets, which are at risk and often beyond recovery after an attack. Existing solutions to upgrade smart contracts depend on manual and error-prone processes. This paper presents a framework, called EVMPatch, to instantly and automatically patch faulty smart contracts. EVMPatch features a bytecode rewriting engine for the popular Ethereum blockchain, and transparently/automatically rewrites common off-the-shelf contracts to upgradable contracts. The proof-of-concept implementation of EVMPatch automatically hardens smart contracts that are vulnerable to integer over/underflows and access control errors, but can be easily extended to cover more bug classes. Our extensive evaluation on 14,000 real-world (vulnerable) contracts demonstrate that our approach successfully blocks attack transactions launched on these contracts, while keeping the intended functionality of the contract intact. We perform a study with experienced software developers, showing that EVMPatch is practical, and reduces the time for converting a given Solidity smart contract to an upgradable contract by 97.6 %, while ensuring functional equivalence to the original contract.",

    "abstract": "In certain blockchain systems, light nodes are clients that download only a small portion of the block. Light nodes are vulnerable to data availability (DA) attacks where a malicious node hides an invalid portion of the block from the light nodes. Recently, a technique based on erasure codes called Coded Merkle Tree (CMT) was proposed by Yu et al. that enables light nodes to detect a DA attack with high probability. The CMT is constructed using LDPC codes for fast decoding but can fail to detect a DA attack if a malicious node hides a small stopping set of the code. To combat this, Yu et al. used well-studied techniques to design random LDPC codes with high minimum stopping set size. Although effective, these codes are not necessarily optimal for this application. In this paper, we demonstrate a more specialized LDPC code design to improve the security against DA attacks. We achieve this goal by providing a deterministic LDPC code construction that focuses on concentrating stopping sets to a small group of variable nodes rather than only eliminating stopping sets. We design these codes by modifying the Progressive Edge Growth algorithm into a technique called the entropy-constrained PEG (EC-PEG) algorithm. This new method demonstrates a higher probability of detecting DA attacks and allows for good codes at short lengths.",

By executing FL, a set of agents can jointly train a model without sharing their datasets with each other, or a third-party. This makes FL particularly suitable for settings where data privacy is desired. At the same time, concealing training data gives attackers an opportunity to inject backdoors into the trained model. It has been shown that an attacker can inject backdoors to the trained model during FL, and then can leverage the backdoor to make the model misclassify later. Several works tried to alleviate this threat by designing robust aggregation functions. However, given more sophisticated attacks are developed over time, which by-pass the existing defenses, we approach this problem from a complementary angle in this work. Particularly, we aim to discourage backdoor attacks by detecting, and punishing the attackers, possibly after the end of training phase. To this end, we develop a hybrid blockchain-based FL framework that uses smart contracts to automatically detect, and punish the attackers via monetary penalties. Our framework is general in the sense that, any aggregation function, and any attacker detection algorithm can be plugged into it. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that our framework preserves the communication-efficient nature of FL, and provide empirical results to illustrate that it can successfully penalize attackers by leveraging our novel attacker detection algorithm.",

The latter is provided by IoT devices authorizing the SC to issue payment to a distributor when the required conditions are met. These conditions include the requirement for a distributor to generate a zero-knowledge proof, generated with a novel proving system called zk-SNARKs. Compared with related work, CrowdPatching protocol offers three main advantages. First, the number of distributors can scale indefinitely by enabling the addition of new distributors at any time after the initial distribution by manufacturers (i.e., redistribution among the distributor network). The latter is not possible in existing protocols and is not account for. Secondly, we leverage the recent common integration of gateway or Hub in IoT deployments in our protocol to make CrowdPatching feasible even for the more constraint IoT devices. Thirdly, the trustworthiness of distributors is considered in our protocol, rewarding the honest distributors' engagements. We provide both informal and formal security analysis of CrowdPatching using Tamarin Prover.",

In this paper, we propose ACeD, a scalable solution to this data availability problem with $O(1)$ communication efficiency, the first to the best of our knowledge. The key innovation is a new protocol that requires each of the $N$ nodes to receive only $O(1/N)$ of the block, such that the data is guaranteed to be available in a distributed manner in the network. Our solution creatively integrates coding-theoretic designs inside of Merkle tree commitments to guarantee efficient and tamper-proof reconstruction; this solution is distinct from Asynchronous Verifiable Information Dispersal (in guaranteeing efficient proofs of malformed coding) and Coded Merkle Tree (which only provides guarantees for random corruption as opposed to our guarantees for worst-case corruption). We implement ACeD with full functionality in 6000 lines of Rust code, integrate the functionality as a smart contract into Ethereum via a high-performance implementation demonstrating up to 10,000 transactions per second in throughput and 6000x reduction in gas cost on the Ethereum testnet Kovan.",

Several state-of-the-art BFT consensus protocols have been proposed in the age of blockchains such as Tendermint [5], Pala [9], Streamlet [8], HotStuff [23], and Fast-HotStuff [17]. These protocols are all leader-based (i.e., protocols run in a series of views, and each view has a delegated node called the leader to coordinate all consensus decisions). To make progress, leader-based BFT protocols usually rely on view synchronization, which is an ad-hoc way of rotating the leader and synchronizing nodes to the same view with the leader for enough overlap time. However, many studies and system implementations show that existing methods of view synchronization are complicated and bug-prone [2], [15], [16], [19]. In this paper, we aim to design a leaderless Byzantine fault tolerant (LBFT) protocol, in which nodes simply compete to propose blocks (containing a batch of clients' requests) without the need of explicit coordination through view synchronization. LBFT also enjoys several other desirable features emphasized recently by the research community, such as the chain structure, pipelining techniques, and advanced cryptography [5], [6], [9], [17], [23]. With these efforts, LBFT can achieve both good performance (e.g., O(n)or O(nlog(n)) message complexity) and prominent simplicity.",

To solve these problems, this paper proposes SG-PBFT: a secure and highly efficient PBFT consensus algorithm for Internet of Vehicles, which is based on a distributed blockchain structure. The distributed structure can reduce the pressure on the central server and decrease the risk of single-node attacks. The SG-PBFT consensus algorithm improves the traditional PBFT consensus algorithm by using a score grouping mechanism to achieve a higher consensus efficiency. The experimental result shows that our method can greatly improve the consensus efficiency and prevent single-node attacks. Specifically, when the number of consensus nodes reaches 1000, the consensus time of our algorithm is only about 27% of what is required for the state-of-the-art consensus algorithm (PBFT).

    "abstract": "Bilinear pairing is a fundamental operation that is widely used in cryptographic algorithms (e.g., identity-based cryptographic algorithms) to secure IoT applications. Nonetheless, the time complexity of bilinear pairing is $O(n^3)$, making it a very time-consuming operation, especially for resource-constrained IoT devices. Secure outsourcing of bilinear pairing has been studied in recent years to enable computationally weak devices to securely outsource the bilinear pairing to untrustworthy cloud servers. However, the state-of-art algorithms often require to pre-compute and store some values, which results in storage burden for devices. In the Internet of Things, devices are generally with very limited storage capacity. Thus, the existing algorithms do not fit the IoT well. In this paper, we propose a secure outsourcing algorithm of bilinear pairings, which does not require pre-computations. In the proposed algorithm, the outsourcer side's efficiency is significantly improved compared with executing the original bilinear pairing operation. At the same time, the privacy of the input and output is ensured. Also, we apply the Ethereum blockchain in our outsourcing algorithm to enable fair payments, which ensures that the cloud server gets paid only when he correctly accomplished the outsourced work. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and secure.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Ethereum gained tremendously in popularity, growing from a daily transaction average of 10K in January 2016 to an average of 500K in January 2020. Similarly, smart contracts began to carry more value, making them appealing targets for attackers. As a result, they started to become victims of attacks, costing millions of dollars. In response to these attacks, both academia and industry proposed a plethora of tools to scan smart contracts for vulnerabilities before deploying them on the blockchain. However, most of these tools solely focus on detecting vulnerabilities and not attacks, let alone quantifying or tracing the number of stolen assets. In this paper, we present Horus, a framework that empowers the automated detection and investigation of smart contract attacks based on logic-driven and graph-driven analysis of transactions. Horus provides quick means to quantify and trace the flow of stolen assets across the Ethereum blockchain. We perform a large-scale analysis of all the smart contracts deployed on Ethereum until May 2020. We identified 1,888 attacked smart contracts and 8,095 adversarial transactions in the wild. Our investigation shows that the number of attacks did not necessarily decrease over the past few years, but for some vulnerabilities remained constant. Finally, we also demonstrate the practicality of our framework via an in-depth analysis on the recent Uniswap and Lendf.me attacks.",

    "abstract": "With the increased use of Internet, governments and large companies store and share massive amounts of personal data in such a way that leaves no space for transparency. When a user needs to achieve a simple task like applying for college or a driving license, he needs to visit a lot of institutions and organizations, thus leaving a lot of private data in many places. The same happens when using the Internet. These privacy issues raised by the centralized architectures along with the recent developments in the area of serverless applications demand a decentralized private data layer under user control. We introduce the Private Data System (PDS), a distributed approach which enables self-sovereign storage and sharing of private data. The system is composed of nodes spread across the entire Internet managing local key-value databases. The communication between nodes is achieved through executable choreographies, which are capable of preventing information leakage when executing across different organizations with different regulations in place. The user has full control over his private data and is able to share and revoke access to organizations at any time. Even more, the updates are propagated instantly to all the parties which have access to the data thanks to the system design. Specifically, the processing organizations may retrieve and process the shared information, but are not allowed under any circumstances to store it on long term. PDS offers an alternative to systems that aim to ensure self-sovereignty of specific types of data through blockchain inspired techniques but face various problems, such as low performance. Both approaches propose a distributed database, but with different characteristics. While the blockchain-based systems are built to solve consensus problems, PDS's purpose is to solve the self-sovereignty aspects raised by the privacy laws, rules and principles.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of IoT devices makes them an ideal target for attackers. To reduce the risk of attacks vendors routinely deliver security updates (patches) for their devices. The delivery of security updates becomes challenging due to the issue of scalability as the number of devices may grow much quicker than vendors' distribution systems. Previous studies have suggested a permissionless and decentralized blockchain-based network in which nodes can host and deliver security updates, thus the addition of new nodes scales out the network. However, these studies do not provide an incentive for nodes to join the network, making it unlikely for nodes to freely contribute their hosting space, bandwidth, and computation resources. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized IoT software update delivery network in which participating nodes referred to as distributors) are compensated by vendors with digital currency for delivering updates to devices. Upon the release of a new security update, a vendor will make a commitment to provide digital currency to distributors that deliver the update; the commitment will be made with the use of smart contracts, and hence will be public, binding, and irreversible. The smart contract promises compensation to any distributor that provides proof-of-distribution, which is unforgeable proof that a single update was delivered to a single device. A distributor acquires the proof-of-distribution by exchanging a security update for a device signature using the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) trustless data exchange protocol. Eliminating the need for trust between the security update distributor and the security consumer (IoT device) by providing fair compensation, can significantly increase the number of distributors, thus facilitating rapid scale out.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the Internet is indispensable when it comes to information dissemination. People rely on the Internet to inform themselves on current news events, as well as to verify facts. We, as a community, are quickly approaching an 'electronic information age' where the majority of information will be distributed electronically and tools to preserve this information will become essential. While archiving online digital information is a good way to preserve online information for future generations, it has many disadvantages including the easy manipulation of archived information, e.g. by the archiving authority. Online information is also prone to getting hacked or being taken offline. Therefore, it is necessary that archived online news information is securely time-stamped with the date and time when it was first archived in a way that cannot be manipulated. The process of 'trusted timestamping' is an established approach for claiming that particular digital information existed at a particular 'point in time' in the past. However, traditional approaches for trusted timestamping depend on the time-stamping authority's fidelity. Directly embedding the hash of a digital file into the blockchain of a cryptocurrency is a more recent method that allows for secure time-stamping, since digital information is stored as part of the transaction information in, e.g. Bitcoin's, blockchain, and not stored at a centralized time-stamping authority. However, there is no system yet available, which uses this approach for archiving and time-stamping online news articles. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to develop a system that 1) enables decentralized trusted time-stamping of web and news articles as a means of making future manipulation of online information identifiable, and 2) allows users to determine the authenticity of articles by checking different versions of the same article online.",

    "abstract": "Recently, enterprises have paid attention to permissioned blockchain (BC), where business transactions among inter-authorized organizations (forming a consortium) can automatically be executed on the basis of a distributed consensus protocol, and applications of BC have expanded as permissioned BC has adopted the features of the smart contract (SC), which is programmable user-defined business logic deployed in BC and executed with the consensus protocol. A single BC-based system will be built across multiple management domains (e.g., the data centers of each organization) having different operational policies (e.g., operational procedures, timing, etc.); although establishing system management and operations over BC-based systems (e.g., SC installation for updates) will be important for production uses, such multi-domain formation will trigger a problem in that executing system operations over BC-based systems will become time-consuming and costly due to the difficulty in unifying and/or adjusting operational policies. Toward solving the problem, we propose an operations execution method for BC-based systems; the primary idea is to define operations as a smart contract so that unified and synchronized cross-organizational operations can be executed effectively by using BC-native features. For the recent BC architecture in which participating nodes have different types of roles, we designed the proposed method as a hybrid architecture characterized with in-BC consensus establishment and execution status management and out-BC operations execution for all types of nodes operated by agents that listen to triggered events including operational instructions defined in SCs. We implemented a prototype with Hyperledger Fabric v1.2.0. A cost estimation with the prototype shows that the total yearly cost of SC installation operations could be reduced by 74 percent compared with a manual method.",

    "abstract": "Public key infrastructures (PKIs) are one of the main building blocks for securing communications over the Internet. Currently, PKIs are under the control of centralized authorities, which is problematic as evidenced by numerous incidents where they have been compromised. The distributed, fault tolerant log of transactions provided by blockchains and more recently, smart contract platforms, constitutes a powerful tool for the decentralization of PKIs. To verify the validity of identity records, blockchain-based identity systems store on chain either all identity records, or, a small (or even constant) sized amount of data to verify identity records stored off chain. However, as most of these systems have never been implemented, there is little information regarding the practical implications of each design's tradeoffs. In this work, we first implement and evaluate the only provably secure, smart contract based PKI of [1] on top of Ethereum. This construction incurs constant-sized storage at the expense of computational complexity. To explore this tradeoff, we propose and implement a second construction which, eliminates the need for trusted setup, preserves the security properties of [1] and, as illustrated through our evaluation, is the only version with constant-sized state that can be deployed on the live chain of Ethereum. Furthermore, we compare these two systems with the simple approach of most prior works, e.g., the Ethereum Name Service, where all identity records are stored on the smart contract's state, to illustrate several shortcomings of Ethereum and its cost model. We propose several modifications for fine tuning the model, which would be useful to be considered for any smart contract platform like Ethereum so that it reaches its full potential to support arbitrary distributed applications.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus exhibits higher throughput in comparison to Proof of Work (PoW) in blockchains. But BFT-based protocols suffer from scalability problems with respect to the number of replicas in the network. The main reason for this limitation is the quadratic message complexity of BFT protocols. Previously, proposed solutions improve BFT performance for normal operation, but will fall back to quadratic message complexity once the protocol observes a certain number of failures. This makes the protocol performance unpredictable as it is not guaranteed that the network will face a a certain number of failures. As a result, such protocols are only scalable when conditions are favorable (i.e., the number of failures are less than a given threshold). To address this issue we propose Proteus, a new BFT-based consensus protocol which elects a subset of nodes $c$ as a root committee. Proteus guarantees stable performance, regardless of the number of failures in the network and it improves on the quadratic message complexity of typical BFT-based protocols to $O(cn)$, where $c<<n$, for large $n$. Thus, message complexity remains small and less than quadratic when $c$ is asymptotically smaller than $n$, and this helps the protocol to provide stable performance even during the view change process (change of root committee). Our view change process is different than typical BFT protocols as it replaces the whole root committee compared to replacing a single primary in other protocols. We deployed and tested our protocol on $200$ Amazon $EC2$ instances, with two different baseline BFT protocols (PBFT and Bchain) for comparison. In these tests, our protocol outperformed the baselines by more than $2\\times$ in terms of throughput as well as latency.",

    "abstract": "Computer programs fast entered in our life and the questions associated with the execution of these programs have become the most relevant in our days. Programs should work efficiently, i.e. work as quickly as possible and spend as little resources as possible. Most often, such a \"measure of efficiency\" is the polynomial program execution time of the length of the input data. Such programs have great importance in the direction of smart contracts on blockchain. In this article will be introduced the method of $\\Delta_0^p$-enrichments which will show how to switch from the usual polynomial model of $\\mathfrak{M}^{(0)}$ using $\\Delta_0^p$-enrichments to a model with new properties and new elements so that the new model will also be polynomial. $\\Delta_0^p-$enrichments: $\\mathfrak{M}^{(0)}\\to ... \\to \\mathfrak{M}^{(i)} \\to ...\\to\\mathfrak{M}$ This method based on theory of semantic programming entered in 1970s and 1980s, academics Ershov and Goncharov and professor Sviridenko. New element $w$ for $M^{(i+1)}$ and not in $M^{(i)}$ generate with some $\\Delta_0^p-$formula $\\Phi_k$ from family $F_j$ for one place predicate $P_j$: $\\mathfrak{M}^{(i)}\\models\\Phi_k(w_1,...,w_{n_k})$, where $w$ is finite list $w = <w_1,...,w_{n_k}>$ and now $\\mathfrak{M}^{(i+1)}\\models P_j(w)$. Then we will create an operator $\\Gamma_{F_{P_1^+},...,F_{P_N^+}}^\\mathfrak{M^{(i)}}$ and prove polynomial analogue of the Gandy fixed point theorem. It allows us to take a different look on polynomial computability. Let $\\Gamma^*$: $\\Gamma_{F_{P_1^+},...,F_{P_N^+}}^\\mathfrak{M}(\\Gamma^*) = \\Gamma^*$ Theorem (polynomial analogue of the Gandy fixed point theorem) Fixed point $\\Gamma^*$ is $\\Delta_0^p-$set and $P_1,...,P_N$ - $\\Delta_0^p-$predicates on $\\mathfrak{M}$ Also proved extended theorem about fixed point and for $HW(\\mathfrak{M})$ model",

    "abstract": "Smart Cities evolve into complex and pervasive urban environments with a citizens' mandate to meet sustainable development goals. Repositioning democratic values of citizens' choices in these complex ecosystems has turned out to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake news and opportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper introduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively engaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public urban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the Ancient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens assemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters. The core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving witness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence and testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the challenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus to empower citizens' trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS localization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and crowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how real-time collective measurements over citizens' choices can be made in a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by deploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of transport means. Furthermore, witness presence of cycling risk is validated using official accident data from public authorities, which are compared against wisdom of the crowd. The paramount role of dynamic consensus, self-governance and ethically aligned artificial intelligence in the augmented democracy paradigm is outlined.",

    "abstract": "In communication networks, network virtualization can usually provide better capacity utilization and quality of service (QoS) than what can be achieved otherwise. However, conventional resource allocation for virtualized networks would still follow a fixed pattern based on the predicted capacity needs of the users, even though, in reality, the actual traffic demand of a user will always tend to fluctuate. The mismatch between the fixed capacity allocation and the actual fluctuating traffic would lead to degradation of provisioned network services and inefficiency in the assigned network capacity. To overcome this, we propose a new spectrum trading (ST) scheme between virtual optical networks (VONs) in the context of an elastic optical network (EON). The key idea here is to allow different VONs to trade their spectrum resources according to the actual capacity they need at different time instants. A VON with unused spectra can then trade away its unused spectra to other VONs that are short of spectrum resources at that time. In exchange, it is rewarded with a certain amount of credit for its contribution to the ST community, which it can then use later to get extra bandwidth, if needed. The trust-worthiness of the trading records between the VONs is ensured in a distributed fashion through a blockchain-assisted account book that is updated whenever a new trade occurs. For this, we develop a software-defined control plane to enable spectrum trading in an EON. The performance of the ST scheme is evaluated and compared with a scenario without such trading. Our results show that the proposed ST scheme is effective in improving the QoS of each VON and significantly improves the overall network capacity utilization.",

    "abstract": "We improve the fundamental security threshold of eventual consensus Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain protocols under the longest-chain rule by showing, for the first time, the positive effect of rounds with concurrent honest leaders. Current security analyses reduce consistency to the dynamics of an abstract, round-based block creation process that is determined by three events associated with a round: (i) event $A$: at least one adversarial leader, (ii) event $S$: a single honest leader, and (iii) event $M$: multiple, but honest, leaders. We present an asymptotically optimal consistency analysis assuming that an honest round is more likely than an adversarial round (i.e., $\\Pr[S] + \\Pr[M] > \\Pr[A]$); this threshold is optimal. This is a first in the literature and can be applied to both the simple synchronous communication as well as communication with bounded delays. In all existing consistency analyses, event $M$ is either penalized or treated neutrally. Specifically, the consistency analyses in Ouroboros Praos (Eurocrypt 2018) and Genesis (CCS 2018) assume that $\\Pr[S] - \\Pr[M] > \\Pr[A]$; the analyses in Sleepy Consensus (Asiacrypt 2017) and Snow White (Fin. Crypto 2019) assume that $\\Pr[S] > \\Pr[A]$. Moreover, all existing analyses completely break down when $\\Pr[S] < \\Pr[A]$. These thresholds determine the critical trade-off between the honest majority, network delays, and consistency error. Our new results can be directly applied to improve the security guarantees of the existing protocols. We also provide an efficient algorithm to explicitly calculate these error probabilities in the synchronous setting. Furthermore, we complement these results by analyzing the setting where $S$ is rare, even allowing $\\Pr[S] = 0$, under the added assumption that honest players adopt a consistent chain selection rule.",

The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain is by far the most well known DLT, used to record transactions among peers, based on the BTC digital currency. In this paper, we focus on the network side of the BTC P2P network, analyzing its nodes from a purely network measurements-based approach. We present a BTC crawler able to discover and track the BTC P2P network through active measurements, and use it to analyze its main properties. Through the combined analysis of multiple snapshots of the BTC network as well as by using other publicly available data sources on the BTC network and DLT, we unveil the BTC P2P network, locate its active nodes, study their performance, and track the evolution of the network over the past two years. Among other relevant findings, we show that (i) the size of the BTC network has remained almost constant during the last 12 months - since the major BTC price drop in early 2018, (ii) most of the BTC P2P network resides in US and EU countries, and (iii) despite this western network locality, most of the mining activity and corresponding revenue is controlled by major mining pools located in China. By additionally analyzing the distribution of BTC coins among independent BTC entities (i.e., single BTC addresses or groups of BTC addresses controlled by the same actor), we also conclude that (iv) BTC is very far from being the decentralized and uncontrolled system it is so much advertised to be, with only 4.5% of all the BTC entities holding about 85% of all circulating BTC coins.",

Cyber threats are growing at an explosive pace making the existing security and privacy measures inadequate. Hence, everyone on the Internet is a product for hackers.

Furthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming popular in modern IoT applications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years addressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques. In this paper, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, starting from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BCtechniques in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported in the past twelve years in the IoT domain.

    "abstract": "Payment channel networks (PCN) are used in cryptocurrencies to enhance the performance and scalability of off-chain transactions. Except for opening and closing of a payment channel, no other transaction requests accepted by a PCN are recorded in the Blockchain. Only the parties which have opened the channel will know the exact amount of fund left at a given instant. In real scenarios, there might not exist a single path which can enable transfer of high value payments. For such cases, splitting up the transaction value across multiple paths is a better approach. While there exists several approaches which route transactions via several paths, such techniques are quite inefficient, as the decision on the number of splits must be taken at the initial phase of the routing algorithm (e.g., SpeedyMurmur [42]). Algorithms which do not consider the residual capacity of each channel in the network are susceptible to failure. Other approaches leak sensitive information, and are quite computationally expensive [28]. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme HushRelay is an efficient privacy preserving routing algorithm, taking into account the funds left in each channel, while splitting the transaction value across several paths. Comparing the performance of our algorithm with existing routing schemes on real instances (e.g., Ripple Network), we observed that HushRelay attains a success ratio of 1, with an execution time of 2.4 sec. However, SpeedyMurmur [42] attains a success ratio of 0.98 and takes 4.74 sec when the number of landmarks is 6. On testing our proposed routing algorithm on the Lightning Network, a success ratio of 0.99 is observed, having an execution time of 0.15 sec, which is 12 times smaller than the time taken by SpeedyMurmur.",

    "abstract": "The property of proportional representation in approval-based committee elections has appeared in the social choice literature for over a century, and is typically understood as avoiding the underrepresentation of minorities. However, we argue that the security of some distributed systems is directly linked to the opposite goal of avoiding the overrepresentation of any minority, a goal which leads us to an optimization objective known as Maximin Support, closely related to the axiom of Proportional Justified Representation (PJR). We provide an inapproximability result for this objective, and propose a new election rule inspired in Phragmen's methods that achieves a) a constant-factor approximation guarantee for the objective, and b) the PJR property. Furthermore, a structural property allows one to quickly verify that the winning committee satisfies the two aforementioned properties, even if the algorithm is executed by an untrusted party who only communicates the output. Finally, we present an efficient post-computation that, when paired with any approximation algorithm for Maximin Support, returns a new solution that a) preserves the approximation guarantee, b) satisfies PJR, and c) can be efficiently verified to satisfy PJR. Our work is motivated by an application on blockchains that implement Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS), where the community must elect a committee of validators to participate in its consensus protocol, and where fighting overrepresentation protects the system against attacks by an adversarial minority. Our election rule enables a validator election protocol with formal and verifiable guarantees on security and proportionality. We propose a specific protocol that can be successfully implemented in spite of the stringent time constraints of a blockchain architecture, and that will be the basis for an implementation in the Polkadot network, launched in 2020.",

    "abstract": "As one of the representative blockchain platforms, Ethereum has attracted lots of attacks. Due to the existed financial loss, there is a pressing need to perform timely investigation and detect more attack instances. Though multiple systems have been proposed, they suffer from the scalability issue due to the following reasons. First, the tight coupling between malicious contract detection and blockchain data importing makes them infeasible to repeatedly detect different attacks. Second, the coarse-grained archive data makes them inefficient to replay transactions. Third, the separation between malicious contract detection and runtime state recovery consumes lots of storage. In this paper, we present the design of a scalable attack detection framework on Ethereum. It overcomes the scalability issue by saving the Ethereum state into a database and providing an efficient way to locate suspicious transactions. The saved state is fine-grained to support the replay of arbitrary transactions. The state is well-designed to avoid saving unnecessary state to optimize the storage consumption. We implement a prototype named EthScope and solve three technical challenges, i.e., incomplete Ethereum state, scalability, and extensibility. The performance evaluation shows that our system can solve the scalability issue, i.e., efficiently performing a large-scale analysis on billions of transactions, and a speedup of around 2,300x when replaying transactions. It also has lower storage consumption compared with existing systems. The result with three different types of information as inputs shows that our system can help an analyst understand attack behaviors and further detect more attacks. To engage the community, we will release our system and the dataset of detected attacks.",

    "abstract": "In order to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries enforced extended social distancing measures for several weeks, effectively pausing the majority of economic activities. In an effort to resume economic activity safely, several Digital Contact Tracing applications and protocols have been introduced with success. However, DCT is a reactive method, as it aims to break existing chains of disease transmission in a population. Therefore DCT is not suitable for proactively preventing the spread of a disease; an approach that relevant to certain use cases, such as international tourism, where individuals travel across borders. In this work, we first identify the limitations characterising DCT related to privacy issues, unwillingness of the public to use DCT mobile apps due to privacy concerns, lack of interoperability among different DCT applications and protocols, and the assumption that there is limited, local mobility in the population. We then discuss the concept of a Health Passport as a means of verifying that individuals are disease risk-free and how it could be used to resume the international tourism sector. Following, we present the DHP Framework that uses a private blockchain and Proof of Authority for issuing Digital Health Passports. The framework provides a distributed infrastructure supporting the issuance of DHPs by foreign health systems and their verification by relevant stakeholders, such as airline companies and border control authorities. We discuss the attributes of the system in terms of its usability and performance, security and privacy. Finally, we conclude by identifying future extensions of our work on formal security and privacy properties that need to be rigorously guaranteed via appropriate security protocols.",

    "abstract": "A companion paper defined the notion of digital social contracts, presented a design for a social-contracts programming language, and demonstrated its potential utility via example social contracts. The envisioned setup consists of people with genuine identifiers, which are unique and singular cryptographic key pairs, that operate software agents thus identified on their mobile device. The abstract model of digital social contracts consists of a transition system specifying concurrent, non-deterministic asynchronous agents that operate on a shared ledger by performing digital speech acts, which are cryptographically-signed sequentially-indexed digital actions. Here, we address the distributed-ledger implementation of digital social contracts in the presence of faulty agents: we present a design of a fault-tolerant distributed-ledger transition system and show that it implements the abstract shared-ledger model of digital social contracts, and discuss its resilience to faulty agents. The result is a novel ledger architecture that is distributed with a blockchain-per-person (as opposed to centralized with one blockchain for all), partially-ordered (as opposed to totally-ordered), locally-replicated (as opposed to globally-replicated), asynchronous (as opposed to globally-synchronized), peer-to-peer with each agent being both an actor and a validator (as opposed to having dedicated miners, validators, and clients), environmentally-friendly (as opposed to the environmentally-harmful Proof-of-Work), self-sufficient (as opposed to the energy-hogging Proof-of-Work or capital-hogging Proof-of-Stake) and egalitarian (as opposed to the plutocratic Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake).",

    "abstract": "Many empirical software engineering studies show that there is a great need for repositories where source code is acquired, filtered and classified. During the last few years, Ethereum block explorer services have emerged as a popular project to explore and search Ethereum blockchain data such as transactions, addresses, tokens, smart-contracts' source code, prices and other activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain. Despite the availability of this kind of services, retrieving specific information useful to empirical software engineering studies, such as the study of smart-contracts' software metrics might require many sub-tasks, such as searching specific transactions in a block, parsing files in HTML format and filtering the smart-contracts to remove duplicated code or unused smart-contracts. In this paper we afford this problem creating Smart Corpus', a Corpus of Smart Contracts in an organized reasoned and up to date repository where Solidity source code and other metadata about Ethereum smart contracts can easily and systematically be retrieved. We present the Smart Corpus' design and its initial implementation and we show how the data-set of smart contracts' source code in a variety of programming languages can be queried and processed, get useful information on smart contracts and their software metrics. The Smart Corpus aims to create a smart-contracts' repository where smart contracts data (source code, ABI and byte-code) are freely and immediately available and also classified based on the main software metrics identified in the scientific literature. Smart-contracts source code has been validated by EtherScan and each contract comes with its own associated software metrics as computed by the freely available software PASO. Moreover, Smart Corpus can be easily extended, as the number of new smart-contracts increases day by day.",

    "abstract": "Smart devices have accentuated the importance of geolocation information. Geolocation identification using smart devices has paved the path for incentive-based location-based services (LBS). A location proof is a digital certificate of the geographical location of a user, which can be used to access various LBS. However, a user full control over a device allows the tampering of location proof. Initially, to resist false proofs, two-party trusted centralized location proof systems (LPS) were introduced to aid the users in generating secure location proofs mutually. However, two-party protocols suffered from the collusion attacks by the participants of the protocol. Consequently, many witness-oriented LPS have emerged to mitigate collusion attacks in two-party protocols. However, witness-oriented LPS presented the possibility of three-way collusion attacks (involving the user, location authority, and the witness). The three-way collusion attacks are inevitable in all existing witness-oriented schemes. To mitigate the inability to resist three-way collusion of existing schemes, in this paper, we introduce a decentralized consensus protocol called as MobChain, where the selection of a witness and location authority is achieved through a distributed consensus of nodes in an underlying P2P network of a private blockchain. The persistent provenance data over the blockchain provides strong security guarantees, as a result, the forging and manipulation become impractical. MobChain provides secure location provenance architecture, relying on decentralized decision making for the selection of participants of the protocol to resist three-way collusion problem. Our prototype implementation and comparison with the state-of-the-art solutions show that MobChain is computationally efficient, highly available while improving the security of LPS.",

    "abstract": "Data privacy and sharing has always been a critical issue when trying to build complex deep learning-based systems to model data. Facilitation of a decentralized approach that could take benefit from data across multiple nodes while not needing to merge their data contents physically has been an area of active research. In this paper, we present a solution to benefit from a distributed data setup in the case of training deep learning architectures by making use of a smart contract system. Specifically, we propose a mechanism that aggregates together the intermediate representations obtained from local ANN models over a blockchain. Training of local models takes place on their respective data. The intermediate representations derived from them, when combined and trained together on the host node, helps to get a more accurate system. While federated learning primarily deals with the same features of data where the number of samples being distributed on multiple nodes, here we are dealing with the same number of samples but with their features being distributed on multiple nodes. We consider the task of bank loan prediction wherein the personal details of an individual and their bank-specific details may not be available at the same place. Our aggregation mechanism helps to train a model on such existing distributed data without having to share and concatenate together the actual data values. The obtained performance, which is better than that of individual nodes, and is at par with that of a centralized data setup makes a strong case for extending our technique across other architectures and tasks. The solution finds its application in organizations that want to train deep learning models on vertically partitioned data.",

In this paper, we introduce a new distributed graph database, called Weaver, which enables efficient, transactional graph analyses as well as strictly serializable ACID transactions on dynamic graphs. The key insight that allows Weaver to combine strict serializability with horizontal scalability and high performance is a novel request ordering mechanism called refinable timestamps. This technique couples coarse-grained vector timestamps with a fine-grained timeline oracle to pay the overhead of strong consistency only when needed. Experiments show that Weaver enables a Bitcoin blockchain explorer that is 8x faster than Blockchain.info, and achieves 12x higher throughput than the Titan graph database on social network workloads and 4x lower latency than GraphLab on offline graph traversal workloads.",

Permissioned ledgers support more flexible governance and a wider choice of consensus mechanisms. Both kinds of decentralized ledgers may be susceptible to manipulation by participants who favor some transactions over others. The real-world accountability underlying permissioned ledgers provides an opportunity to impose fairness constraints that can be enforced by penalizing violators after-the- fact. To date, however, this opportunity has not been fully exploited, unnecessarily leaving participants latitude to manipulate outcomes undetectably. This paper draws attention to this issue, and proposes design principles to make such manipulation more difficult, as well as specific mechanisms to make it easier to detect when violations occur.",

The miners collectively build a tree of blocks, and they are paid when they create a node (mine a block) which will end up in the path of the tree that is adopted by all. Since the miners can hide newly mined nodes, they play a game with incomplete information. Here we consider two simplified forms of this game in which the miners have complete information. In the simplest game the miners release every mined block immediately, but are strategic on which blocks to mine. In the second more complicated game, when a block is mined it is announced immediately, but it may not be released so that other miners cannot continue mining from it. A miner not only decides which blocks to mine, but also when to release blocks to other miners. In both games, we show that when the computational power of each miner is relatively small, their best response matches the expected behavior of the bitcoin designer. However, when the computational power of a miner is large, he deviates from the expected behavior, and other Nash equilibria arise.",

This was a main problem in a classical circuit and a blockchain was introduced to solve this issue. In qBitcoin, the double-spending problem never happens and its security is guaranteed theoretically by virtue of quantum information theory. Making a block is time consuming and the system of qBitcoin is based on a quantum chain, instead of blocks. Therefore a payment can be completed much faster than Bitcoin.

We discuss how the impact and likelihood of privacy violations can be decomposed and quantified, and stress the importance of meaningful metrics and units of measurement.

    "abstract": "Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable energy resources and improvements in battery technology. While these changes enhance sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant management challenges as the complexity of power systems increases. To tackle these challenges, decentralized Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. Within a transactive microgrid, \"prosumers\" (i.e., consumers with energy generation and storage capabilities) can trade energy with each other, thereby smoothing the load on the main grid using local supply. It is hard, however, to provide security, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system. On the one hand, prosumers' personal information must be protected from their trade partners and the system operator. On the other hand, the system must be protected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize the entire grid. This paper describes Privacy-preserving Energy Transactions (PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that enables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy. PETra builds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and provides anonymity for communication, bidding, and trading.",

    "abstract": "Soon after its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin has been adopted by cyber-criminals, which rely on its pseudonymity to implement virtually untraceable scams. One of the typical scams that operate on Bitcoin are the so-called Ponzi schemes. These are fraudulent investments which repay users with the funds invested by new users that join the scheme, and implode when it is no longer possible to find new investments. Despite being illegal in many countries, Ponzi schemes are now proliferating on Bitcoin, and they keep alluring new victims, who are plundered of millions of dollars. We apply data mining techniques to detect Bitcoin addresses related to Ponzi schemes. Our starting point is a dataset of features of real-world Ponzi schemes, that we construct by analysing, on the Bitcoin blockchain, the transactions used to perform the scams. We use this dataset to experiment with various machine learning algorithms, and we assess their effectiveness through standard validation protocols and performance metrics. The best of the classifiers we have experimented can identify most of the Ponzi schemes in the dataset, with a low number of false positives.",

Our consensus design enjoys the same consistency, liveness, transaction finality and security guarantee, a de-facto with the Hybrid Consensus. We go on to propose the idea of a new virtual machine on top of Ethereum which adds permissioned-chain based transaction processing capabilities in a permissionless setting.

To address this problem, we present Securify, a security analyzer for Ethereum smart contracts that is scalable, fully automated, and able to prove contract behaviors as safe/unsafe with respect to a given property. Securify's analysis consists of two steps. First, it symbolically analyzes the contract's dependency graph to extract precise semantic information from the code. Then, it checks compliance and violation patterns that capture sufficient conditions for proving if a property holds or not. To enable extensibility, all patterns are specified in a designated domain-specific language. Securify is publicly released, it has analyzed >18K contracts submitted by its users, and is regularly used to conduct security audits by experts. We present an extensive evaluation of Securify over real-world Ethereum smart contracts and demonstrate that it can effectively prove the correctness of smart contracts and discover critical violations.",

    "abstract": "TrueBit is a protocol that uses interactive verification to allow a resource-constrained computation environment like a blockchain to perform much larger computations than usual in a trusted way. As long as a single honest participant is present to verify the computation, an invalid computation cannot get accepted. In TrueBit, the presence of such a verifier is incentivised by randomly injected forced errors. Additionally, in order to counter sybil attacks, the reward for finding an error drops off exponentially with the number of challengers. The main drawback of this mechanism is that it makes it very hard to predict whether participation will be profitable or not. To even out the rewards, we propose to randomly select multiple solvers from a pool and evenly share the fees among them, while still allowing outside challengers. Furthermore, a proof of independent execution will make it harder to establish computation pools which share computation results.",

    "abstract": "Modern cryptocurrency systems, such as Ethereum, permit complex financial transactions through scripts called smart contracts. These smart contracts are executed many, many times, always without real concurrency. First, all smart contracts are serially executed by miners before appending them to the blockchain. Later, those contracts are serially re-executed by validators to verify that the smart contracts were executed correctly by miners. Serial execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit today's concurrent multicore and cluster architectures. Nevertheless, serial execution appears to be required: contracts share state, and contract programming languages have a serial semantics. This paper presents a novel way to permit miners and validators to execute smart contracts in parallel, based on techniques adapted from software transactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts speculatively in parallel, allowing non-conflicting contracts to proceed concurrently, and \"discovering\" a serializable concurrent schedule for a block's transactions, This schedule is captured and encoded as a deterministic fork-join program used by validators to re-execute the miner's parallel schedule deterministically but concurrently. Smart contract benchmarks run on a JVM with ScalaSTM show that a speedup of of 1.33x can be obtained for miners and 1.69x for validators with just three concurrent threads.",

Further, the integrity of the voting is enforced by all voters themselves and without a weakest link, the protocol becomes more robust. We introduce a taxonomy of notions of distribution in online voting protocols that we apply on selected online voting protocols. Accordingly, blockchain-based protocols seem to be promising for online voting due to their similarity with paper-based protocols.",

Using that knowledge, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive called uncentralisable ledger and study its properties. We use those properties to analyse what an uncentralisable ledger may offer to classic electronic voting systems and how it opens up the realm of possibilities for completely new voting mechanisms.

    "abstract": "SBFT is a state of the art Byzantine fault tolerant permissioned blockchain system that addresses the challenges of scalability, decentralization and world-scale geo-replication. SBFTis optimized for decentralization and can easily handle more than 200 active replicas in a real world-scale deployment. We evaluate \\sysname in a world-scale geo-replicated deployment with 209 replicas withstanding f=64 Byzantine failures. We provide experiments that show how the different algorithmic ingredients of \\sysname increase its performance and scalability. The results show that SBFT simultaneously provides almost 2x better throughput and about 1.5x better latency relative to a highly optimized system that implements the PBFT protocol. To achieve this performance improvement, SBFT uses a combination of four ingredients: using collectors and threshold signatures to reduce communication to linear, using an optimistic fast path, reducing client communication and utilizing redundant servers for the fast path.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of electric vehicles has spurred the research interest in technologies associated with it, for instance, batteries, and charging mechanisms. Moreover, the recent advancements in autonomous cars also encourage the enabling technologies to integrate and provide holistic applications. To this end, one key requirement for electric vehicles is to have an efficient, secure, and scalable infrastructure and framework for charging, billing, and auditing. However, the current manual charging systems for EVs may not be applicable to the autonomous cars that demand new, automatic, secure, efficient, and scalable billing and auditing mechanism. Owing to the distributed systems such as blockchain technology, in this paper, we propose a new charging and billing mechanism for electric vehicles that charge their batteries in a charging-on-the-move fashion. To meet the requirements of billing in electric vehicles, we leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT), a distributed peer-to-peer technology for micro-transactions. Our proof-of-concept implementation of the billing framework demonstrates the feasibility of such system in electric vehicles. It is also worth noting that the solution can easily be extended to the electric autonomous cars (EACs).",

    "abstract": "As more and more data is collected for various reasons, the sharing of such data becomes paramount to increasing its value. Many applications ranging from smart cities to personalized health care require individuals and organizations to share data at an unprecedented scale. Data sharing is crucial in today's world, but due to privacy reasons, security concerns and regulation issues, the conditions under which the sharing occurs needs to be carefully specified. Currently, this process is done by lawyers and requires the costly signing of legal agreements. In many cases, these data sharing agreements are hard to track, manage or enforce. In this work, we propose a novel alternative for tracking, managing and especially enforcing such data sharing agreements using smart contracts and blockchain technology. We design a framework that generates smart contracts from parameters based on legal data sharing agreements. The terms in these agreements are automatically enforced by the system. Monetary punishment can be employed using secure voting by external auditors to hold the violators accountable. Our experimental evaluation shows that our proposed framework is efficient and low-cost.",

The real value of such assets can only be realized by allowing IoT data trading to occur on a marketplace that rewards every single producer and consumer, at a very granular level. Crucially, we believe that such a marketplace should not be owned by anybody, and should instead fairly and transparently self-enforce a well defined set of governance rules. In this paper we address some of the technical challenges involved in realizing such a marketplace. We leverage emerging blockchain technologies to build a decentralized, trusted, transparent and open architecture for IoT traffic metering and contract compliance, on top of the largely adopted IoT brokered data infrastructure. We discuss an Ethereum-based prototype implementation and experimentally evaluate the overhead cost associated with Smart Contract transactions, concluding that a viable business model can indeed be associated with our technical approach.",

However, it is known to be inefficient due to its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm and has the potential hazard of double spending. In this paper, we aim to reduce the probability of double spending by decreasing the probability of consecutive winning. We first formalize a PoW-based decentralized secure network model in order to present a quantitative analysis. Next, to resolve the risk of double spending, we propose the personalized difficulty adjustment (PDA) mechanism which modifies the difficulty of each participant such that those who win more blocks in the past few rounds have a smaller probability to win in the next round. To analyze the performance of the PDA mechanism, we observe that the system can be modeled by a high-order Markov chain. Finally, we show that PDA effectively decreases the probability of consecutive winning and results in a more trustworthy PoW-based system.",

(FOCS 2012) converts any boolean formula into a resilient formula of polynomial size that works correctly if less than a fraction $1/6$ of the gates (on every input-to-output path) are faulty. We improve the result of Kalai et al., and show how to efficiently fortify any boolean formula against a fraction $1/5$ of short-circuit gates per path, with only a polynomial blowup in size. We additionally show that it is impossible to obtain formulas with higher resilience and sub-exponential growth in size. Towards our results, we consider interactive coding schemes when noiseless feedback is present; these produce resilient boolean formulas via a Karchmer-Wigderson relation. We develop a coding scheme that resists up to a fraction $1/5$ of corrupted transmissions in each direction of the interactive channel. We further show that such a level of noise is maximal for coding schemes with sub-exponential blowup in communication. Our coding scheme takes a surprising inspiration from Blockchain technology.",

Such a service places tremendous trust on service operators which our work aims to relieve. To this end we introduce a new autonomous data management concept which transfers responsibility for the sensitive data from administrators to secure and verifiable hardware. The main idea is to manage all data access via a cluster of autonomous computation agents running inside Intel SGX enclaves. These EConfidante agents share a secret data key which is unknown to any external entity, including the data service administrators, thus eliminating many opportunities for data exposure. In this paper we describe a detailed design of the EConfidante system, its flow and how it is managed and implemented. Our #MeToo design also uses an immutable distributed ledger which is built using components from a Blockchain framework. We implemented a proof of concept of our system for the #MeToo use case and analyze its security properties and implementation details.",

Our protocol introduces a Map-reduce PoW mining algorithm to perform alongside Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) verification, which together allow for transactions to be confirmed immediately, largely improving scalability. In addition, the protocol is designed such that forking cannot occur, ensuring strong consistency and security against a multitude of attacks. The Map-reduce PoW mining process ensures that no single entity can control the network, guaranteeing decentralization.

A specific FSPVM, denoted as FSPVM-E, was developed in Coq based on a general, extensible, and reusable formal memory (GERM) framework, an extensible and universal formal intermediate programming language, denoted as Lolisa, which is a large subset of the Solidity programming language that uses generalized algebraic datatypes, and a corresponding formally verified interpreter for Lolisa, denoted as FEther, which serves as a crucial component of FSPVM-E. However, our past work has demonstrated that the execution efficiency of the standard development of FEther is extremely low. As a result, FSPVM-E fails to achieve its expected verification effect. The present work addresses this issue by first identifying three root causes of the low execution efficiency of formal interpreters. We then build abstract models of these causes, and present respective optimization schemes for rectifying the identified conditions. Finally, we apply these optimization schemes to FEther, and demonstrate that its execution efficiency has been improved significantly.",

    "abstract": "The increasing uptake of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution systems and the rapid advance of technology have established new scenarios in the operation of low-voltage networks. In particular, recent trends in cryptocurrencies and blockchain have led to a proliferation of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading schemes, which allow the exchange of energy between the neighbors without any intervention of a conventional intermediary in the transactions. Nevertheless, far too little attention has been paid to the technical constraints of the network under this scenario. A major challenge to implementing P2P energy trading is that of ensuring that network constraints are not violated during the energy exchange. This paper proposes a methodology based on sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of P2P transactions on the network and to guarantee an exchange of energy that does not violate network constraints. The proposed method is tested on a typical UK low-voltage network. The results show that our method ensures that energy is exchanged between users under the P2P scheme without violating the network constraints, and that users can still capture the economic benefits of the P2P architecture.",

A primary concern with PoS systems is the \"rich getting richer\" phenomenon, whereby wealthier nodes are more likely to get elected, and hence reap the block reward, making them even wealthier. In this paper, we introduce the notion of equitability, which quantifies how much a proposer can amplify her stake compared to her initial investment. Even with everyone following protocol (i.e., honest behavior), we show that existing methods of allocating block rewards lead to poor equitability, as does initializing systems with small stake pools and/or large rewards relative to the stake pool. We identify a \\emph{geometric} reward function, which we prove is maximally equitable over all choices of reward functions under honest behavior and bound the deviation for strategic actions; the proofs involve the study of optimization problems and stochastic dominances of Polya urn processes, and are of independent mathematical interest. These results allow us to provide a systematic framework to choose the parameters of a practical incentive system for PoS cryptocurrencies.",

These technologies can help improve product and service quality, and organizational performance. In many regions, the internet is now as ubiquitous as electricity. Components are relatively cheap. A robust ecosystem of open-source software libraries means that engineers can solve problems 100 times faster than just two decades ago. This digital transformation is leading us toward connected intelligent automation: smart, hyperconnected agents deployed in environments where humans and machines cooperate, and leverage data, to achieve shared goals. This is not the worlds first industrial revolution. In fact, it is its fourth, and the disruptive changes it will bring suggest we will need a fresh perspective on quality to adapt to it.",

We further optimize the \\emph{Lachesis Protocol} by introducing a permission-less network for dynamic participation. Root selection cost is further optimized by the introduction of an n-row flag table, as well as optimizing path selection by introducing domination relationships. We propose an alternative framework for distributed ledgers, based on asynchronous partially ordered sets with logical time ordering instead of blockchains. This paper builds upon the original proposed family of \\emph{Lachesis-class} consensus protocols.

Due to the fact that transactions to smart contracts commonly involve cryptocurrency transfer, any successful attacks can lead to money loss or even financial disorder. In this paper, we focus on the overflow attacks in Ethereum , mainly because they widely rooted in many smart contracts and comparatively easy to exploit. We have developed EASYFLOW , an overflow detector at Ethereum Virtual Machine level. The key insight behind EASYFLOW is a taint analysis based tracking technique to analyze the propagation of involved taints. Specifically, EASYFLOW can not only divide smart contracts into safe contracts, manifested overflows, well-protected overflows and potential overflows, but also automatically generate transactions to trigger potential overflows. In our preliminary evaluation, EASYFLOW managed to find potentially vulnerable Ethereum contracts with little runtime overhead.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain systems and smart contracts provide ways to securely implement multi-party transactions without the use of trusted intermediaries, which currently underpin many commercial transactions. However, they do so by transferring trust to computer systems, raising the question of whether code can be trusted. Experience with high value losses resulting from incorrect code has already shown that formal verification of smart contracts is likely to be beneficial. This note investigates the specification and verification of a simple form of multi-party transaction, atomic swaps. It is argued that logics with the ability to express properties of strategies of players in a multi-agent setting are conceptually useful for this purpose, although ultimately, for our specific examples, the less expressive setting of temporal logic suffices for verification of concrete implementations. This is illustrated through a number of examples of the use of a model checker to verify atomic swap smart contracts in on-chain and cross-chain settings.",

We present quantitative results for the Ethereum blockchain, and validate the effectiveness of both approaches using a set of curated token systems as ground truth.

Recall rates of 89% (with well explainable missed detections) indicate that the first approach may also be able to identify \"hidden\" or undocumented token systems that intentionally do not implement the standard.

Since then, a number protocol changes have been introduced, but their effectiveness has not yet been reassessed. Furthermore, little is known about traceability of Monero transactions across hard fork chains. We formalize a new method for tracing Monero transactions, which is based on analyzing currency hard forks. We use that method to perform a (passive) traceability analysis on data from the Monero, MoneroV and Monero Original blockchains and find that only a small amount of inputs are traceable. We then use the results to estimate the effectiveness of known heuristics for recent transactions and find that they do not significantly outperform random guessing. Our findings suggest that Monero is currently mostly immune to known passive attack vectors and resistant to tracking and tracing methods applied to other cryptocurrencies.",

It is very difficult to master, yet it arises all over modern computing systems, both when the communication medium is shared memory and when it is by message passing. Concurrent programming is hard because it requires to cope with many possible, unpredictable behaviors of communicating processes interacting with each other. Right from the start in the 1960s, the main way of dealing with concurrency has been by reduction to sequential reasoning. We trace this history, and illustrate it through several examples, from early ideas based on mutual exclusion, passing through consensus and concurrent objects, until today ledgers and blockchains. We conclude with a discussion on the limits that this approach encounters, related to fault-tolerance, performance, and inherently concurrent problems.",

To date, threshold cryptosystems have been considered under permissioned settings with a limited adversary. Our framework relies on an escrow service that slashes and redistributes deposits to incentivize participants to adhere desired behaviors. Today, more than ever, sophisticated escrow services can be implemented over public blockchains like Ethereum, without additional trust assumptions. The key threat to rational threshold cryptosystems is collusion---by cooperating `illegally', a subset of participants can reveal the cryptosystem's secret, which, in turn is translated to unfair profit. Our countermeasure to collusion is framing. If the escrow is notified of collusion, it rewards the framer and slashes the deposits of all other participants. We show that colluding parties find themselves in the prisoner's dilemma, where the dominant strategy is framing.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of blockchain based distributed ledgers is growing fast due to their ability to provide reliability, integrity, and auditability without trusted entities. One of the key capabilities of these emerging platforms is the ability to create self-enforcing smart contracts. However, the development of smart contracts has proven to be error-prone in practice, and as a result, contracts deployed on public platforms are often riddled with security vulnerabilities. This issue is exacerbated by the design of these platforms, which forbids updating contract code and rolling back malicious transactions. In light of this, it is crucial to ensure that a smart contract is secure before deploying it and trusting it with significant amounts of cryptocurrency. To this end, we introduce the VeriSolid framework for the formal verification of contracts that are specified using a transition-system based model with rigorous operational semantics. Our model-based approach allows developers to reason about and verify contract behavior at a high level of abstraction. VeriSolid allows the generation of Solidity code from the verified models, which enables the correct-by-design development of smart contracts.",

Validators execute the same schedule as miners. We find that our speculative technique yields estimated speed-ups starting at about 8-fold in 2016, declining to about 2-fold at the end of 2017, where speed-up is measured using either gas costs or instruction counts.

Empirically, this market has failed to yield stable equilibria with predictable prices for desired levels of service. We argue that this is due to the absence of a dominant strategy equilibrium in the current fee mechanism. We propose an alternative fee setting mechanism that is inspired by generalized second price auctions. The design of such a mechanism is challenging because miners can use any criteria for including transactions and can manipulate the results of the auction after seeing the proposed fees. Nonetheless, we show that our proposed protocol is free from manipulation as the number of users increases. We further show that, for a large number of users and miners, the gain from manipulation is small for all parties. This results in users proposing fees that represent their true utility and lower variance of revenue for miners. Historical analysis shows that Bitcoin users could have saved $272,528,000 USD in transaction fees while miners could have reduced the variance of fee income by an average factor of 7.4 times.",

    "abstract": "The production and consumption of information about Bitcoin and other digital-, or 'crypto'-, currencies have grown together with their market capitalisation. However, a systematic investigation of the relationship between online attention and market dynamics, across multiple digital currencies, is still lacking. Here, we quantify the interplay between the attention towards digital currencies in Wikipedia and their market performance. We consider the entire edit history of currency-related pages, and their view history from July 2015. First, we quantify the evolution of the cryptocurrency presence in Wikipedia by analysing the editorial activity and the network of co-edited pages. We find that a small community of tightly connected editors is responsible for most of the production of information about cryptocurrencies in Wikipedia. Then, we show that a simple trading strategy informed by Wikipedia views performs better, in terms of returns on investment, than classic baseline strategies for most of the covered period. Our results contribute to the recent literature on the interplay between online information and investment markets, and we anticipate it will be of interest for researchers as well as investors.",

    "abstract": "Offchain networks emerge as a promising solution to address the scalability challenge of blockchain. Participants directly make payments through a network of payment channels without the overhead of committing onchain transactions. Routing is critical to the performance of offchain networks. Existing solutions use either static routing with poor performance or dynamic routing with high overhead to obtain the dynamic channel balance information. In this paper, we propose Flash, a new dynamic routing solution that leverages the unique characteristics of transactions in offchain networks to strike a better tradeoff between path optimality and probing overhead. By studying the traces of real offchain networks, we find that the payment sizes are heavy-tailed, and most payments are highly recurrent. Flash thus differentiates the treatment of elephant payments from mice payments. It uses a modified max-flow algorithm for elephant payments to find paths with sufficient capacity, and strategically routes the payment across paths to minimize the transaction fees. Mice payments are directly sent by looking up a routing table with a few precomputed paths to reduce probing overhead. Testbed experiments and data-driven simulations show that Flash improves the success volume of payments by up to 2.3x compared to the state-of-the-art routing algorithm.",

While most of the work has focused on detecting *vulnerable* contracts, in this paper, we focus on finding how many of these vulnerable contracts have actually been *exploited*. We survey the 23,327 vulnerable contracts reported by six recent academic projects and find that, despite the amounts at stake, only 1.98% of them have been exploited since deployment. This corresponds to at most 8,487 ETH (~1.7 million USD), or only 0.27% of the 3 million ETH (600 million USD) at stake. We explain these results by demonstrating that the funds are very concentrated in a small number of contracts which are *not exploitable* in practice.",

LN has been claimed as the solution for several of Bitcoin's weaknesses such as its difficulty to scale in number of transactions per second and its expensiveness for relative small amount exchanged. LN is based upon a network of micro-channels opened and closed by issuing transactions on the Blockchain and capable to interact among themselves thanks to the Multi-hop framework. In this work I analysed the evolution of LN from its topological point of view and tried to understand how it impacts over some of Bitcoin's historical core foundamentals such as the resilience against attacks and failures and the user's anonymity. Another question I have tried to answer is whether the evolution of LN's topology will make its synchronization easier.",

    "abstract": "We study the computation contests where players compete for searching a solution to a given problem with a winner-take-all reward. The search processes are independent across the players and the search speeds of players are proportional to their computational powers. One concrete application of this abstract model is the mining process of proof-of-work type blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin. Although one's winning probability is believed to be proportional to his computational power in previous studies on Bitcoin, we show that it is not the case in the strict sense. Because of the gaps between the winning probabilities and the proportions of computational powers, the Matthew effect will emerge in the system, where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. In addition, we show that allowing the players to pool with each other or reducing the number of solutions to the problem may aggravate the Matthew effect and vice versa.",

As agents exchange tokens a network structure is created in which the tokens move from agent to agent. Agents form the vertices in the network and the exchange of tokens creates the link structure. The rules of exchange adopted collectively by agents shape the network structure and affect the distribution of tokens amongst agents. Many inventions including banking, payments networks and blockchain technology have been created for the purpose of keeping accurate records of these implicit networks. However, our formal understanding of tokenised systems as large scale, iterative, interacting structures is limited. The aim of this paper is to study the dynamics of token exchanges as a game, and introduce a mathematical framework for understanding ledgers as complex networks.",

In this paper we aim to fill this gap and propose ZETH, an adaptation of Zerocash that can be deployed on top of Ethereum without making any change to the base layer. Our study shows that not only ZETH could be used to transfer Ether, the base currency of Ethereum, but it could also be used to transfer other types of smart contract-based digital assets. We propose an analysis of ZETH's privacy promises and argue that information leakages intrinsic to the use of this protocol are controlled and well-defined, which makes it a viable solution to support private transactions in the context of public and permissioned chains.",

Over a billion dollars worth of currency has been stolen since its release in July 2015. As smart contracts cannot be updated after deployment, it is imperative that the programming language supports the development of robust contracts. We propose Flint, a new statically-typed programming language specifically designed for writing robust smart contracts. Flint's features enforce the writing of safe and predictable code. To encourage good practices, we introduce protection blocks. Protection blocks restrict who can run code and when (using typestate) it can be executed. To prevent vulnerabilities relating to the unintentional loss of currency, Flint Asset traits provide safe atomic operations, ensuring the state of contracts is always consistent. Writes to state are restricted, simplifying reasoning about smart contracts.",

    "abstract": "Increased interest in scalable and high-throughput blockchains has led to an explosion in the number of committee selection methods in the literature. Committee selection mechanisms allow consensus protocols to safely select a committee, or a small subset of validators that is permitted to vote and verify a block of transactions, in a distributed ledger. There are many such mechanisms, each with substantially different methodologies and guarantees on communication complexity, resource usage, and fairness. In this paper, we illustrate that, despite these implementation-level differences, there are strong statistical similarities between committee selection mechanisms. We concretely show this by proving that the committee selection of the Avalanche consensus protocol can be used to choose committees in the Stellar Consensus Protocol that satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions for Byzantine agreement. We also verify these claims using simulations and numerically observe sharp phase transitions as a function of protocol parameters. Our results suggest the existence of a \"statistical taxonomy\" of committee selection mechanisms in distributed consensus algorithms.",

In a preliminary analysis, we confirm that the Lightning Network can be classified as a small-world and scale-free network. Based on these findings, we develop a series of strategies for targeted attacks and introduce metrics that allow us to quantify the adversary's advantage. Our results indicate that an attacker who is able to remove a certain number of nodes should follow a centrality-based strategy, while a resource-limited attacker who aims for high efficiency should employ a highest ranked minimum cut strategy.",

This issue arises due to the gap between Cryptography and Distributed Systems security, which deals with traditional security problems that ignore the explicit consideration of incentives, and Game Theory, which deals best with situations involving incentives. With this work, we aim to offer a systematization of the work that relates to this problem, considering papers that blend Game Theory with Cryptography or Distributed systems and discussing how they can be related.

In this work, we revise the Bitcoin consensus mechanism by proposing StrongChain, a scheme that introduces transparency and incentivizes participants to collaborate rather than to compete. The core design of our protocol is to reflect and utilize the computing power aggregated on the blockchain which is invisible and \"wasted\" in Bitcoin today. Introducing relatively easy, although important changes to Bitcoin's design enables us to improve many crucial aspects of Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies making it more secure, efficient, and profitable for participants. We thoroughly analyze our approach and we present an implementation of StrongChain. The obtained results confirm its efficiency, security, and deployability.",

Nevertheless, each of these issues requires rethinking when participants are autonomous and potentially adversarial. We propose the notion of a *cross-chain deal*, a new way to structure complex distributed computations that manage assets in an adversarial setting. Deals are inspired by classical atomic transactions, but are necessarily different, in important ways, to accommodate the decentralized and untrusting nature of the exchange. We describe novel safety and liveness properties, along with two alternative protocols for implementing cross-chain deals in a system of independent blockchain ledgers. One protocol, based on synchronous communication, is fully decentralized, while the other, based on semi-synchronous communication, requires a globally shared ledger.",

This is a solution for the \"permanent web\", which enjoys a steadily growing community interest and adoption. The IPFS is, in addition, one of the most prominent solutions for blockchain storage. We go beyond the straightforward case of using the IPFS for hosting malicious content, and explore ways in which a botmaster could employ it, to manage her bots, validating our findings experimentally.

Based on a survey of 24 specific stablecoin projects, we go beyond individual coins for extracting general concepts and approaches. We combine our findings with learnings from classical monetary policy, resulting in a comprehensive taxonomy of cryptocurrency stabilization. We use our taxonomy to highlight the current state of development from different perspectives and show blank spots. For instance, while over 91% of projects promote 1-to-1 stabilization targets to external assets, monetary policy literature suggests that the smoothing of short term volatility is often a more sustainable alternative. Our taxonomy bridges computer science and economics, fostering the transfer of expertise. For example, we find that 38% of the reviewed projects use a combination of exchange rate targeting and specific stabilization techniques that can render them vulnerable to speculative economic attacks - an avoidable design flaw.",

The analysis by Eyal and Sirer, as well as in followup work, considers a \\emph{single} deviating miner (who may control a large fraction of the hashing power in the network) interacting with a remaining pool of honest miners. Here, we extend this analysis to the case where there are \\emph{multiple} (non-colluding) selfish miners. We find that with multiple strategic miners, specific deviations from honest mining by multiple strategic agents can outperform honest mining, even if individually miners would not be incentivised to be dishonest. This previous point effectively renders the Bitcoin protocol to be less secure than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Since the creation of Bitcoin, transaction tracking is one of the prominent means for following the movement of Bitcoins involved in illegal activities. Although every Bitcoin transaction is recorded in the blockchain database, which is transparent for anyone to observe and analyse, Bitcoin's pseudonymity system and transaction obscuring techniques still allow criminals to disguise their transaction trail. While there have been a few attempts to develop tracking methods, there is no accepted evaluation method to measure their accuracy. Therefore, this paper investigates strategies for transaction tracking by introducing two new tainting methods, and proposes an address profiling approach with a metrics-based evaluation framework. We use our approach and framework to compare the accuracy of our new tainting methods with the previous tainting techniques, using data from two real Bitcoin theft transactions and several related control transactions.",

    "abstract": "Sidechain technology has been envisioned as a promising solution to accelerate today's public blockchains in terms of scalability and interoperability. By relying on the mainchain for security, different sidechains can formulate their own rules to reach consensus. Although the literature has considered the possibility of using consensus protocols in the sidechain, so far a tailor-made consensus protocol for sidechains with high performance and formal security proof has not been attempted. To fill this gap, we introduce Cumulus, a low overhead, highly efficient, security provable sidechain protocol. Cumulus makes use of smart contracts to ensure that only one block proposed in the sidechain will be enforced on the mainchain in each round, thereby achieving consensus in an efficient manner. We give a formal specification of Cumulus which ensures safety and liveness without any online requirements of clients. For security analysis, we provide formal security definitions and proofs under Universally Composable Security (UCS) model. As a proof of concept, we implement Cumulus and evaluate it in an Ethereum testnet.",

This kind of dynamics can effectively be modeled within the framework of queuing theory where customers' arrivals are described by point process models. However, these approaches are limited by parametric assumptions as to, for example, inter-event time distributions. In this paper, we address these limitations and propose a novel, deep neural network solution to the queuing problem. Our solution combines a recurrent neural network that models the arrival process with a recurrent generative adversarial network which models the service time distribution.

    "abstract": "As one of the representative Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchain platforms, EOSIO's ecosystem grows rapidly in recent years. A number of vulnerabilities and corresponding attacks of EOSIO's smart contracts have been discovered and observed in the wild, which caused a large amount of financial damages. However, the majority of EOSIO's smart contracts are not open-sourced. As a result, the WebAssembly code may become the only available object to be analyzed in most cases. Unfortunately, current tools are web-application oriented and cannot be applied to EOSIO WebAssembly code directly, which makes it more difficult to detect vulnerabilities from those smart contracts. In this paper, we propose \\toolname, a static analysis tool that can be used to detect vulnerabilities from EOSIO WASM code automatically. We focus on one particular type of vulnerabilities named \\textit{fake-transfer}, and the exploitation of such vulnerabilities has led to millions of dollars in damages. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to build an automatic tool to detect vulnerabilities of EOSIO's smart contracts. The experimental results demonstrate that our tool is able to detect fake transfer vulnerabilities quickly and precisely.

    "abstract": "Federated identity management enables users to access multiple systems using a single login credential. However, to achieve this a complex privacy compromising authentication has to occur between the user, relying party (RP) (e.g., a business), and a credential service provider (CSP) that performs the authentication. In this work, we use a smart contract on a blockchain to enable an architecture where authentication no longer involves the CSP. Authentication is performed solely through user to RP communications (eliminating fees and enhancing privacy). No third party needs to be contacted, not even the smart contract. No public key infrastructure (PKI) needs to be maintained. And no revocation lists need to be checked. In contrast to competing smart contract approaches, ours is hierarchically managed (like a PKI) enabling better validation of attribute providers and making it more useful for large entities to provide identity services for their constituents (e.g., a government) while still enabling users to maintain a level of self-sovereignty.",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks have attracted tremendous attention from their volatile price movements and the promise of decentralization. However, most projects run on business narratives with no way to test and verify their assumptions and promises about the future. The complex nature of system dynamics within networked economies has rendered it difficult to reason about the growth and evolution of these networks. This paper drew concepts from differential games, classical control engineering, and stochastic dynamical system to come up with a framework and example to model, simulate, and engineer networked token economies. A model on a generalized token economy is proposed where miners provide service to a platform in exchange for a cryptocurrency and users consume service from the platform. Simulations of this model allow us to observe outcomes of complex dynamics and reason about the evolution of the system. Speculative price movements and engineered block rewards were then experimented to observe their impact on system dynamics and network-level goals. The model presented is necessarily limited so we conclude by exploring those limitations and outlining future research directions.",

The pvalue is calculated based on the non-conformity scores which indicate how well a log matches an event. This approach is tested on a large number of real-world HDFS logs and IIoT logs.

We address a general model of trustless system in which participants are distinguished by their stake or trust: users and validators. Users are normal participants with a no assumed trust and validators are high profile participants with an established trust. We then propose a new family of stake-based consensus protocols $\\mathfrak{S}$, operating on the DAG as in the Lachesis protocol~\\cite{lachesis01}. Specifically, we propose a stake-based protocol $S_\\phi$ that leverages participants' stake as validating weights to achieve more secure distributed systems with practical Byzantine fault tolerance (pBFT) in leaderless asynchronous Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). We then present a general model of staking for asynchronous DAG-based distributed systems.",

Therefore, the need for a security protocol on the Internet of Things (IoT) has not yet been resolved. Recently, Khor and Sidorov cryptanalyzed the Wang et al. protocol and presented an improved version of it. In this paper, at first, we show that this protocol also does not have sufficient security and so it is not recommended to be used in any application. More precisely, we present a full secret disclosure attack against this protocol, which extracted the whole secrets of the protocol by two communication with the target tag. In addition, Sidorv et al. recently proposed an ultralightweight mutual authentication RFID protocol for blockchain enabled supply chains, supported by formal and informal security proofs.

This scheme represents a first integration of the use of cryptocurrencies by members of the spamming industry. Using a dataset of 4,340,736 sextortion spams, this research aims at understanding such new amalgamation by uncovering spammers' operations. To do so, a simple, yet effective method for projecting Bitcoin addresses mentioned in sextortion spams onto transaction graph abstractions is computed over the entire Bitcoin blockchain. This allows us to track and investigate monetary flows between involved actors and gain insights into the financial structure of sextortion campaigns. We find that sextortion spammers are somewhat sophisticated, following pricing strategies and benefiting from cost reductions as their operations cut the upper-tail of the spamming supply chain. We discover that one single entity is likely controlling the financial backbone of the majority of the sextortion campaigns and that the 11-month operation studied yielded a lower-bound revenue between \\$1,300,620 and \\$1,352,266. We conclude that sextortion spamming is a lucrative business and spammers will likely continue to send bulk emails that try to extort money through cryptocurrencies.",

In this paper, we propose a protocol-agnostic approach to improve the design of primary backup consensus protocols. At the core of our approach is a novel wait-free approach of running several instances of the underlying consensus protocol in parallel. To yield a high performance parallelized design, we present coordination-free techniques to order operations across parallel instances, deal with instance failures, and assign clients to specific instances. Consequently, the design we present is able to reduce the load on individual instances and primaries, while also reducing the adverse effects of any malicious replicas.",

    "abstract": "Consensus is one of the most fundamental distributed computing problems. In particular, it serves as a building block in many replication based fault-tolerant systems and in particular in multiple recent blockchain solutions. Depending on its exact variant and other environmental assumptions, solving consensus requires multiple communication rounds. Yet, there are known optimistic protocols that guarantee termination in a single communication round under favorable conditions. In this paper we present a generic optimizer than can turn any consensus protocol into an optimized protocol that terminates in a single communication round whenever all nodes start with the same predetermined value and no Byzantine failures occur (although node crashes are allowed). This is regardless of the network timing assumptions and additional oracle capabilities assumed by the base consensus protocol being optimized. In the case of benign failures, our optimizer works whenever the number of faulty nodes $f<n/2$. For Byzantine behavior, our optimizer's resiliency depends on the validity variant sought. In the case of classical validity, it can accommodate $f<n/4$ Byzantine failures. With the more recent external validity function assumption, it works whenever $f<n/3$. Either way, our optimizer only relies on oral messages, thereby imposing very light-weight crypto requirements.",

In this paper we propose a minimal calculus for Solidity contracts, which extends an imperative core with a single primitive to transfer currency and invoke contract procedures.

During normal operation, Consensus Nodes do not inspect the computation but oversee that participating nodes execute their tasks with due diligence and adjudicate potential result challenges. While the architecture can significantly increase throughput, Verification Nodes still have to duplicate the computation fully. In this paper, we refine the architecture such that result verification is distributed and parallelized across many Verification Nodes. The full architecture significantly increases throughput and delegates the computation work to the specialized Execution Nodes and the onus of checking it to a variety of less powerful Verification Nodes. We provide a full protocol specification of the verification process, including challenges to faulty computation results and the resulting adjudication process. Furthermore, we formally prove liveness and safety of the system.",

    "abstract": "High voter turnout in elections and referendums is very desirable in order to ensure a robust democracy. Secure electronic voting is a vision for the future of elections and referendums. Such a system can counteract factors that hinder strong voter turnout such as the requirement of physical presence during limited hours at polling stations. However, this vision brings transparency and confidentiality requirements that render the design of such solutions challenging. Specifically, the counting must be implemented in a reproducible way and the ballots of individual voters must remain concealed. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a referendum protocol that ensures transparency, confidentiality, and integrity, in trustless networks. The protocol is built by combining Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) and Distributed Ledger or Blockchain technology. The persistence and immutability of the protocol communication allows verifiability of the referendum outcome on the client side. Voters therefore do not need to trust in third parties. We provide a formal description and conduct a thorough security evaluation of our proposal.",

    "abstract": "Despite the high stakes involved in smart contracts, they are often developed in an undisciplined manner, leaving the security and reliability of blockchain transactions at risk. In this paper, we introduce ContraMaster: an oracle-supported dynamic exploit generation framework for smart contracts. Existing approaches mutate only single transactions; ContraMaster exceeds these by mutating the transaction sequences. ContraMaster uses data-flow, control-flow, and the dynamic contract state to guide its mutations. It then monitors the executions of target contract programs, and validates the results against a general-purpose semantic test oracle to discover vulnerabilities. Being a dynamic technique, it guarantees that each discovered vulnerability is a violation of the test oracle and is able to generate the attack script to exploit this vulnerability. In contrast to rule-based approaches, ContraMaster has not shown any false positives, and it easily generalizes to unknown types of vulnerabilities (e.g., logic errors). We evaluate ContraMaster on 218 vulnerable smart contracts. The experimental results confirm its practical applicability and advantages over the state-of-the-art techniques, and also reveal three new types of attacks.",

    "abstract": "This paper applies biomimetic engineering to the problem of permissionless Byzantine consensus and achieves results that surpass the prior state of the art by four orders of magnitude. It introduces a biologically inspired asymmetric Sybil-resistance mechanism, Proof-of-Balance, which can replace symmetric Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake weighting schemes. The biomimetic mechanism is incorporated into a permissionless blockchain protocol, Key Retroactivity Network Consensus (\"KRNC\"), which delivers ~40,000 times the security and speed of today's decentralized ledgers. KRNC allows the fiat money that the public already owns to be upgraded with cryptographic inflation protection, eliminating the problems inherent in bootstrapping new currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The paper includes two independently significant contributions to the literature. First, it replaces the non-structural axioms invoked in prior work with a new formal method for reasoning about trust, liveness, and safety from first principles. Second, it demonstrates how two previously overlooked exploits, book-prize attacks and pseudo-transfer attacks, collectively undermine the security guarantees of all prior permissionless ledgers.",

Recently, the ``curse of modeling\" and ``curse of dimensionality\" of the cross-system design paradigm have resulted in the popularity of using artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize the Internet of information. However, many significant research challenges remain to be addressed for the AI approach, including the lack of high-quality training data due to privacy and resources constraints in this data-driven approach. To address these challenges, we need to take a look at humans' cooperation in a larger time scale. To facilitate cooperation in modern history, we have built three major technologies: ``grid of transportation\", ``grid of energy\", and ``the Internet of information\". In this paper, we argue that the next cooperation paradigm could be the ``Internet of intelligence (Intelligence-Net)\", where intelligence can be easily obtained like energy and information, enabled by the recent advances in blockchain technology. We present some recent advances in these areas, and discuss some open issues and challenges that need to be addressed in the future.",

In this paper, we prove that a natural longest chain PoS protocol with similar predictability as Nakamoto's PoW protocol can achieve security against any adversary with less than 1/(1+e) fraction of the total stake. Moreover we propose a new family of longest chain PoS protocols that achieve security against a 50% adversary, while only requiring short-term predictability.

    "abstract": "Federated learning, as a promising machine learning approach, has emerged to leverage a distributed personalized dataset from a number of nodes, e.g., mobile devices, to improve performance while simultaneously providing privacy preservation for mobile users. In the federated learning, training data is widely distributed and maintained on the mobile devices as workers. A central aggregator updates a global model by collecting local updates from mobile devices using their local training data to train the global model in each iteration. However, unreliable data may be uploaded by the mobile devices (i.e., workers), leading to frauds in tasks of federated learning. The workers may perform unreliable updates intentionally, e.g., the data poisoning attack, or unintentionally, e.g., low-quality data caused by energy constraints or high-speed mobility. Therefore, finding out trusted and reliable workers in federated learning tasks becomes critical. In this article, the concept of reputation is introduced as a metric. Based on this metric, a reliable worker selection scheme is proposed for federated learning tasks. Consortium blockchain is leveraged as a decentralized approach for achieving efficient reputation management of the workers without repudiation and tampering. By numerical analysis, the proposed approach is demonstrated to improve the reliability of federated learning tasks in mobile networks.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we saw the emergence of consensus-based database systems that promise resilience against failures, strong data provenance, and federated data management. Typically, these fully-replicated systems are operated on top of a primary-backup consensus protocol, which limits the throughput of these systems to the capabilities of a single replica (the primary). To push throughput beyond this single-replica limit, we propose concurrent consensus. In concurrent consensus, replicas independently propose transactions, thereby reducing the influence of any single replica on performance. To put this idea in practice, we propose our RCC paradigm that can turn any primary-backup consensus protocol into a concurrent consensus protocol by running many consensus instances concurrently. RCC is designed with performance in mind and requires minimal coordination between instances. Furthermore, RCC also promises increased resilience against failures. We put the design of RCC to the test by implementing it in ResilientDB, our high-performance resilient blockchain fabric, and comparing it with state-of-the-art primary-backup consensus protocols. Our experiments show that RCC achieves up to 2.75x higher throughput than other consensus protocols and can be scaled to 91 replicas.",

BitConduite offers an entity-centered view on transactions, making the data accessible to non-technical experts through a guided workflow for classification of entities according to several activity metrics. Other novelties are the possibility to cluster entities by similarity and exploration of transaction data at different scales, from large groups of entities down to a single entity and the associated transactions. Two use cases illustrate the workflow of the system and its analytic power. We report on feedback regarding the approach and the the software tool gathered during a workshop with domain experts, and we discuss the potential of the approach based on our findings.",

Due to the lack of isolation mechanisms a single mistake or vulnerability in the code can bring the whole system down, and due to this smart contract upgrades can be especially dangerous. Traditional ways to ensure the security of a smart contract, including DSLs, auditing and static analysis, are used before the code is deployed to the blockchain, and thus offer no protection after the deployment. After each upgrade the whole code need to be verified again, which is a difficult and time-consuming process that is prone to errors. To address these issues a security protocol and framework for smart contracts called Cap9 was developed. It provides developers the ability to perform upgrades in a secure and robust manner, and improves isolation and transparency through the use of a low level capability-based security model. We have used Isabelle/HOL to develop a formal specification of the Cap9 framework and prove its consistency. The paper presents a refinement-based approach that we used to create the specification, as well as discussion of some encountered difficulties during this process.",

    "abstract": "In the area of blockchains, a wallet is anything that manages the access to cryptocurrencies and tokens. Off-chain wallets appear in different forms, from paper wallets to hardware wallets to dedicated wallet apps, while on-chain wallets are realized as smart contracts. Wallet contracts are supposed to increase trust and security by being transparent and by offering features like daily limits, approvals, multiple signatures, and recovery mechanisms. Ethereum is the most prominent platform for both, tokens and smart contracts, and thus also for on-chain wallets. Our work aims at a better understanding of Ethereum on-chain wallets, which represent one of the most frequent types of smart contracts. By analyzing source code, bytecode, and execution traces, we derive usage scenarios and patterns. We discuss several methods for identifying wallet contracts in a semi-automatic manner by looking at the deployed bytecodes and their interaction patterns. We extract blueprints for wallets and thereby compile a ground truth. Furthermore, we differentiate characteristics of wallets in use, and group them into six types. We provide numbers and temporal perspectives regarding the creation and use of wallets. We analyze the data of the Ethereum main chain up to block 8450000, mined on August 30, 2019.",

Since we use a fully formalized model of infrastructures with actors and policies we can support a novel way of formal security refinement for system specifications. This formal process is built practically as an extension to the Isabelle Infrastructure framework with attack trees. We define a formal notion of refinement on infrastructure models. Thanks to the formal foundation of Kripke structures and branching time temporal logic in the Isabelle Infrastructure framework, these stepwise transformations can be interleaved with attack tree analysis thus providing a fully formal security engineering framework. The process is illustrated on an IoT healthcare case study introducing GDPR requirements and blockchain.",

We propose an architecture for ITS that resorts to DLT features. Moreover, we provide experimental results of a real test-bed over IOTA, a promising DLT for IoT.

All OAuth 2.0 protocol flows result in the creation of an access token, which is then used by a user to request access to a protected resource. Nevertheless, the definition of access tokens is transparent to the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which does not specify any particular token format, how tokens are generated, or how they are used. Instead, the OAuth 2.0 specification leaves all these as design choices for integrators. In this paper, we propose a new type of OAuth 2.0 token backed by a distributed ledger. Our construction is secure, and it supports proof-of-possession, auditing, and accountability. Furthermore, we provide added-value token management services, including revocation, delegation, and fair exchange by leveraging smart contracts. We realized a proof-of-concept implementation of our solution using Ethereum smart contracts and the ERC-721 token specification.",

Existing protocols for this task assume either a synchronous network (where all messages are delivered within some known time $\\Delta$) or an asynchronous network (where messages can be delayed arbitrarily). Although protocols for the latter case give seemingly stronger guarantees, this is not the case since they (inherently) tolerate a lower fraction of corrupted parties. We design an SMR protocol that is network-agnostic in the following sense: if it is run in a synchronous network, it tolerates $t_s$ corrupted parties; if the network happens to be asynchronous it is resilient to $t_a \\leq t_s$ faults. Our protocol achieves optimal tradeoffs between $t_s$ and $t_a$.",

In this paper, we study the structure of the resulting overlay network, as it significantly influences the robustness and performance of IPFS. We monitor and systematically crawl IPFS' DHT towards mapping the IPFS overlay network. Our measurements found an average of 44474 nodes at every given time. At least 52.19% of these reside behind a NAT and are not reachable from the outside, suggesting that a large share of the network is operated by private individuals on an as-needed basis. Based on our measurements and our analysis of the IPFS code, we conclude that the topology of the IPFS network is, in its current state, closer to an unstructured overlay network than it is to a classical DHT. While such a structure has benefits for robustness and the resistance against Sybil attacks, it leaves room for improvement in terms of performance and query privacy.",

We formalize a defense to double-spend attacks. We show that when the victim can counterattack in the same way as the attacker, this leads to a variation on the classic game-theoretic War of Attrition model. The threat of this kind of counterattack induces a subgame perfect equilibrium in which no attack occurs in the first place.",

In this paper we design a graph-based provenance model for AI assets and their relations within an AI value chain. Moreover, we propose a protocol to exchange AI assets securely to selected parties. The provenance model and exchange protocol are then combined and implemented as a smart contract on a permission-less blockchain. We show how the smart contract enables the tracing of AI assets in an existing industry use case while solving all challenges. Consequently, our smart contract helps to increase traceability and transparency, encourages trust between actors and thus fosters collaboration between them.",

The ever-increasing demand of data-volume, as well as speed of such applications, have essentially transported these applications from their comfort zone: static setting, to a challenging territory of dynamic updates. At the same time, mainstreaming of multi-core processors have entailed that the dynamic applications should be able to exploit concurrency as soon as parallelization gets inhibited. Thus, the design and implementation of efficient concurrent dynamic graph algorithms have become significant. This paper reports a novel library of concurrent shared-memory algorithms for breadth-first search (BFS), single-source shortest-path (SSSP), and betweenness centrality (BC) in a dynamic graph. The presented algorithms are provably non-blocking and linearizable. We extensively evaluate C++ implementations of the algorithms through several micro-benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the scalability with the number of threads. Our experiments also highlight the limitations of static graph analytics methods in a dynamic setting.",

Graphs were generated, using R and Gephi, in which nodes represent addresses and edges represent the exchange of bitcoin. The six hour data set was subsetted into a one and two hour sampling snapshot of the network. We performed comparisons and analysis on all subsets of the data in an effort to determine the minimum sampling length that represented the network as a whole. Our results suggest that the six hour sampling was the minimum limit with respect to sampling time needed to accurately characterize the bitcoin transaction network.Anonymity is a desired feature of the blockchain and bitcoin network however, it limited us in our analysis and conclusions we drew from our results were mostly inferred. Future work is needed and being done to gather more comprehensive data so that the bitcoin transaction network can be better analyzed.",

We performed an empirical study with 20 participants comparing Obsidian to Solidity, which is the language most commonly used for writing smart contracts today.

This paper presents a thorough analysis of the privacy offered by the Lightning Network. We present three main attacks that exploit publicly available information about the network topology and its active nodes and channels in order to learn information that is designed to be kept secret, such as how many coins a node has available to spend or who the sender and recipient are in a payment routed through the network. We evaluate one of our attacks on the live network and, due to cost and ethical considerations, evaluate our other two attacks on a simulated Lightning network that faithfully mimics the real one.",

This is consistent with the perspective that, in order to keep a the Blockchain system secure from double spending attacks, the proof or work must cost a sizable fraction of the value that can be transferred through the network.

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are Turing-complete programs that execute on the infrastructure of the blockchain, which often manage valuable digital assets. Solidity is one of the most popular programming languages for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. Like traditional programs, smart contracts may contain vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional programs, smart contracts cannot be easily patched once they are deployed. It is thus important that smart contracts are tested thoroughly before deployment. In this work, we present an adaptive fuzzer for smart contracts on the Ethereum platform called sFuzz. Compared to existing Solidity fuzzers, sFuzz combines the strategy in the AFL fuzzer and an efficient lightweight multi-objective adaptive strategy targeting those hard-to-cover branches. sFuzz has been applied to more than 4 thousand smart contracts and the experimental results show that (1) sFuzz is efficient, e.g., two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art tools; (2) sFuzz is effective in achieving high code coverage and discovering vulnerabilities; and (3) the different fuzzing strategies in sFuzz complement each other.",

However, in Ethereum, miners do not receive a reward for verifying. This implies that miners face the Verifier's Dilemma: use resources for verification, or use them for the more lucrative mining of new blocks? We provide an extensive analysis of the Verifier's Dilemma, using a data-driven model-based approach that combines closed-form expressions, machine learning techniques and discrete-event simulation. We collect data from over 300,000 smart contracts and experimentally obtain their CPU execution times. Gaussian Mixture Models and Random Forest Regression transform the data into distributions and inputs suitable for the simulator. We show that, indeed, it is often economically rational not to verify. We consider two approaches to mitigate the implications of the Verifier's Dilemma, namely parallelization and active insertion of invalid blocks, both will be shown to be effective.",

Thus, it is more fine-grained than the location-based metering of state-of-the-art infrastructure, which traditionally aggregates on a building or household level, defining the entity to be billed. However, such in-device energy metering is susceptible to manipulation and fraud. As a remedy, we propose a decentralized metering architecture that enables devices with IoT capabilities to measure their own energy consumption. In this architecture, the device-level consumption is additionally reported to a system-level aggregator that verifies distributed information and provides secure data storage using Blockchain, preventing data manipulation by untrusted entities. Using evaluations on an experimental testbed, we show that the proposed architecture supports device mobility and enables location-independent monitoring of energy consumption.",

Solidity is a domain-specific programming language with the purpose of defining smart contracts. It aims at reducing the transaction costs occasioned by the execution of contracts on the distributed ledgers such as the Ethereum. However, Solidity contracts need to adhere safety and security requirements that require formal verification and certification. This paper proposes a method to meet such requirements by translating Solidity contracts to Event-B models, supporting certification. To that purpose, we define a restrained Solidity subset and a transfer function which translates Solidity contracts to Event-B models. Then we take advantage of Event-B method capabilities to refine models at different levels of abstraction to verify Solidity contracts' properties. And we can verify the generated proof obligations of the Event-B model with the help of the Rodin platform.",

A quorum system is a collection of subsets of all processes, called quorums, with the property that each pair of quorums have a non-empty intersection. They can be found at the core of many reliable distributed systems, such as cloud computing platforms, distributed storage systems and blockchains. In this paper we give a new interpretation of quorum systems, starting with classical majority-based quorum systems and extending this to Byzantine quorum systems. We propose an algebraic representation of the theory underlying quorum systems making use of multivariate polynomial ideals, incorporating properties of these systems, and studying their algebraic varieties. To achieve this goal we will exploit properties of Boolean Groebner bases. The nice nature of Boolean Groebner bases allows us to avoid part of the combinatorial computations required to check consistency and availability of quorum systems. Our results provide a novel approach to test quorum systems properties from both algebraic and algorithmic perspectives.",

In this paper, we propose Free2Shard -- a new architecture that achieves near-linear scaling while being secure against a fully adaptive adversary. The focal point of this architecture is a dynamic self-allocation algorithm that lets users allocate themselves to shards in response to adversarial action, without requiring a central or cryptographic proof. This architecture has several attractive features unusual for sharding protocols, including: (a) the ability to handle the regime of large number of shards (relative to the number of nodes); (b) heterogeneous shard demands; (c) requiring only a small minority to follow the self-allocation; (d) asynchronous shard rotation; (e) operation in a purely identity-free proof-of-work setting. The key technical contribution is a deep mathematical connection to the classical work of Blackwell in dynamic game theory.",

First, we show that existing state-of-the-art solutions using unsupervised anomaly detection methods are inadequate to detect the illicit patterns in a real Bitcoin transaction dataset. Then, we show that our proposed active learning solution is capable of matching the performance of a fully supervised baseline by using just 5\\% of the labels. This solution mimics a typical real-life situation in which a limited number of labels can be acquired through manual annotation by experts.",

This Merkle B-Tree builds on previous work of q-ary Merkle trees which use concise, constant size, q-mercurial commitments for intranode proofs. Although these q-ary trees reduce the branching factor and height, they still have their heights based on the key length, and are forced to fixed heights. Instead of basing nodes on q-ary prefix trees, the B Merkle Tree incorporates concise intranode commitments within a self-balancing tree. The tree is based on the ordering of elements, which requires extra information to determine element placement, but it enables significantly smaller proof sizes. This allows for much lower tree heights (directed by the order of elements, not the size of the key), and therefore creates smaller and more efficient proofs and operations. Additionally, the B Merkle Tree is defined with subset queries that feature similar communication costs to non-membership proofs. Our scheme has the potential to benefit outsourced database models, like blockchain, which use authenticated data structures and database indices to ensure immutability and integrity of data. We present potential applications in key-value stores, relational databases, and, in part, Merkle forests.",

    "abstract": "Existing Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols address only threshold failures, where the participating nodes fail independently of each other, each one fails equally likely, and the protocol's guarantees follow from a simple bound on the number of faulty nodes. With the widespread deployment of Byzantine consensus in blockchains and distributed ledgers today, however, more sophisticated trust assumptions are needed. This paper presents the first implementation of BFT consensus with generalized quorums. It starts from a number of generalized trust structures motivated by practice and explores methods to specify and implement them efficiently. In particular, it expresses the trust assumption by a monotone Boolean formula (MBF) with threshold operators and by a monotone span program (MSP), a linear-algebraic model for computation. An implementation of HotStuff BFT consensus using these quorum systems is described as well and compared to the existing threshold model. Benchmarks with HotStuff running on up to 40 replicas demonstrate that the MBF specification incurs no significant slowdown, whereas the MSP expression affects latency and throughput noticeably due to the involved computations.",

Internet of things, artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum cryptography is only a few of the paradigms that are likely to contribute to determining the final portrait of the future smart grid.

To this end, in this article, a systematic review of the emerging paradigms is presented, identifying intersectoral synergies and limitations with respect to the `smart grid' concept. Further, a taxonomic framework for assessing the level of sustainability of the grid is proposed. Finally, from the scenario portrayed, a set of issues involving engineering, regulation, security, and social frameworks have been derived in a theoretical fashion. The findings are likely to suggest the urgent need for multidisciplinary cooperation to wisely address engineering and ontological challenges gravitating around the smart grid concept.",

In this paper, we are interested in protocols that are stateless, i.e., a new joining node should be able to retrieve the current state of the ledger just using a fixed amount of data that characterizes the ledger (such as the genesis block in Bitcoin). We define three variants of stateless DLTs: weak, strong, and probabilistic. Then, we analyze this property for DLTs using different types of consensus.",

    "abstract": "The protocol for cryptocurrencies can be divided into three parts, namely consensus, wallet, and networking overlay. The aim of the consensus part is to bring trustless rational peer-to-peer nodes to an agreement to the current status of the blockchain. The status must be updated through valid transactions. A proof-of-work (PoW) based consensus mechanism has been proven to be secure and robust owing to its simple rule and has served as a firm foundation for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Specialized mining devices have emerged, as rational miners aim to maximize profit, and caused two problems: i) the re-centralization of a mining market and ii) the huge energy spending in mining. In this paper, we aim to propose a new PoW called Error-Correction Codes PoW (ECCPoW) where the error-correction codes and their decoder can be utilized for PoW. In ECCPoW, puzzles can be intentionally generated to vary from block to block, leading to a time-variant puzzle generation mechanism. This mechanism is useful in repressing the emergence of the specialized mining devices. It can serve as a solution to the two problems of recentralization and energy spending.",

The existing crowdsourcing platforms and their reputation computation are centralised and hence prone to various attacks or malicious manipulation of the data by the central entity. A few distributed crowdsourcing platforms have been proposed but they lack a robust reputation mechanism. So we propose a decentralised crowdsourcing platform having an immutable reputation mechanism to tackle these problems. It is built on top of Ethereum network and does not require the user to trust a third party for a non malicious experience. It also utilizes IOTAs consensus mechanism which reduces the cost for task evaluation significantly.",

This paper presents the synthesis of a design workshop held at the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (RCPE) and subsequent interviews with healthcare professionals. The main research question posed is whether these processes can be re-imagined using digital technologies, specifically Self-Sovereign Identity? A key contribution in the paper is the development of a set of user-led requirements and design principles for identity systems used within healthcare. These are then contrasted with the design principles found in the literature.

    "abstract": "Many blockchain systems today, including Bitcoin, rely on Proof of Work (PoW). Proof of work is crucial to the liveness and security of cryptocurrencies. The assumption when using PoW is that a lot of trial and error is required on average before a valid block is generated. One of the main concerns raised with regard to this kind of system is the inherent need to \"waste\" energy on \"meaningless\" problems. In fact, the Bitcoin system is believed to consume more electricity than several small countries [5]. In this work we formally define three properties that are necessary for wasteless PoW systems: (1) solve \"meaningful\" problems (2) solve them efficiently and (3) be secure against double-spend attacks. We analyze these properties and deduce constraints that impose on PoW systems. In particular, we conclude that under realistic assumptions, the set of allowed functions for mining must be preimage resistant functions. Finally, we propose a modification to the Bitcoin consensus rule that allows users to upload a certain subset of preimage resistant problems and let the mining process solve them. We prove security against Double-Spend attacks identical to the existing security guarantee in Bitcoin today.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain systems have gained substantial traction recently, partly due to the potential of decentralized immutable mediation of economic activities. Ethereum is a prominent example that has the provision for executing stateful computing scripts known as Smart Contracts. These smart contracts resemble traditional programs, but with immutability being the core differentiating factor. Given their immutability and potential high monetary value, it becomes imperative to develop high-quality smart contracts. Software metrics have traditionally been an essential tool in determining programming quality. Given the similarity between smart contracts (written in Solidity for Ethereum) and object-oriented (OO) programming, OO metrics would appear applicable. In this paper, we empirically evaluate inheritance-based metrics as applied to smart contracts. We adopt this focus because, traditionally, inheritance has been linked to a more complex codebase which we posit is not the case with Solidity based smart contracts. In this work, we evaluate the hypothesis that, due to the differences in the context of smart contracts and OO programs, it may not be appropriate to use the same interpretation of inheritance based metrics for assessment.",

    "abstract": "Payment channel networks (PCN) enable scalable blockchain transactions without fundamentally changing the underlying distributed ledger algorithm. However, routing a payment via multiple channels in a PCN requires locking collateral for potentially long periods of time. Adversaries can abuse this mechanism to conduct denial-of-service attacks. Previous work on denial-of-service attacks focused on source routing, which is unlikely to remain a viable routing approach as these networks grow. In this work we examine the effectiveness of attacks in PCNs that use routing algorithms based on local knowledge, where compromised intermediate nodes delay or drop transactions to create denial-of-service. We focus on SpeedyMurmurs as a representative of such protocols. Our attack simulations show that SpeedyMurmurs is resilient to attacks by randomly selected intermediate nodes because it dynamically adjusts using local knowledge. We further consider attackers that control a significant fractions of paths and we show that this ability to route around problematic regions becomes insufficient for such attackers. We propose methods to incentivize payment channel networks with less central nodes and more diverse paths and show through simulation that these methods effectively mitigate the identified denial-of-service attacks.",

Participants are expected to minimize costs that are due to the allocation of liquidity as well as blockchain record fees. In this paper we study the optimization of maintenance costs of such networks. We present for the first time, a closed model for symmetric off-chain channels, and provide efficient algorithms for constructing minimal cost spanning-tree networks under this model. We prove that for any network demands, a simple hub topology provides a 2-approximation to the minimal maintenance cost showing that spanning trees in general are efficient. We also show an unbounded price of anarchy in a greedy game between the transactors, when each player wishes to minimize his costs by changing the network's structure. Finally, we simulate and compare the costs of payment networks with scale free demand topologies.",

Although a few decompilers for smart contracts have been recently proposed, it is still not easy for users to grasp the semantic information of the contract, not to mention the potential misleading due to decompilation errors. In this paper, we propose the first system named STAN to generate descriptions for the bytecodes of smart contracts to help users comprehend them. In particular, for each interface in a smart contract, STAN can generate four categories of descriptions, including functionality description, usage description, behavior description, and payment description, by leveraging symbolic execution and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques. Extensive experiments show that STAN can generate adequate, accurate, and readable descriptions for contract's bytecodes, which have practical value for users.",

Recently, the mining pools are proved to be vulnerable for several possible attacks, and pool block withholding attack is one of them: one strategic pool manager sends some of her miners to other pools and these miners pretend to work on the puzzles but actually do nothing. And these miners still get reward since the pool manager can not recognize these malicious miners. In this work, we revisit the game-theoretic model for pool block withholding attacks and propose a revised approach to reallocate the reward to the miners. Fortunately, in the new model, the pool managers have strong incentive to not launch such attacks. We show that for any number of mining pools, no-pool-attacks is always a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, with only two minority mining pools participating, no-pool-attacks is actually the unique Nash equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "Custody is a core financial service in which the custodian holds in safekeeping assets on behalf of the client. Although traditional custody service is typically endorsed by centralized authorities, decentralized custody scheme has become technically feasible since the emergence of digital assets, and furthermore it is badly needed by new applications such as blockchain and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). In this work, we propose a framework of decentralized asset custody scheme that is able to support a large number of custodians and safely hold customer assets of multiple times value of the total security deposit. The proposed custody scheme distributes custodians and assets into many custodian groups via combinatorial designs and random sampling, where each group fully controls the assigned assets. Since every custodian group is small, the overhead cost is significantly reduced. The liveness is also improved because even a single alive group would be able to process transactions. The security of this custody scheme is guaranteed in the game-theoretic sense, such that any adversary corrupting a bounded fraction of custodians cannot move assets more than his own security deposit. We further analyze the security and performance of our constructions, and give explicit examples with concrete numbers and figures for a better understanding of our results.",

    "abstract": "This article proposes a self-organizing collaborative computing network with an approach to enhance the expectation of a collaborating node for joining the self-organizing network. The proposed approach relies on Ethereum cryptocurrency and Smart Contract to enhance the expectation of collaborating nodes by monetizing the services provided to the self-organizing network. Furthermore, an escrow based smart contract is formalized in the proposed framework to sustains the monetary trust issue between collaborating nodes. The proposed scheme can enforce an autonomic incentive management mechanism to any type of self-organizing networks such as self-organizing clouds, ad-hoc networks, self-organizing federated cloud networks, self-organizing federated learning networks, and self-organizing D2D networks to name a few. Considering the distributed nature of these self-organizing networks and the Ethereum blockchain network, a distributed agent-based methodology is materialized in the proposed framework. Following this, a proof of concept implementation for the general case of a self-organizing cloud is presented. Lastly, the article provides some insights into possible future directions using the proposed framework.",

For example, the accounts due to attacks can be removed. In this paper, we conduct the first investigation on erasable accounts that can be removed to save system resources and even users' money (i.e., ETH or gas). In particular, we propose and develop a novel tool named GLASER, which analyzes the State DataBase of Ethereum to discover five kinds of erasable accounts. The experimental results show that GLASER can accurately reveal 508,482 erasable accounts and these accounts lead to users wasting more than 106 million dollars. GLASER can help stop further economic loss caused by these detected accounts. Moreover, GLASER characterizes the attacks/behaviors related to detected erasable accounts through graph analysis.",

To resolve this availability-finality dilemma, we formulate a new class of flexible consensus protocols, ebb-and-flow protocols, which support a full dynamically available ledger in conjunction with a finalized prefix ledger. The finalized ledger falls behind the full ledger when the network partitions but catches up when the network heals. Gasper, the current candidate protocol for Ethereum 2.0's beacon chain, combines the finality gadget Casper FFG with the LMD GHOST fork choice rule and aims to achieve this property. However, we discovered an attack in the standard synchronous network model, highlighting a general difficulty with existing finality-gadget-based designs. We present a construction of provably secure ebb-and-flow protocols with optimal resilience. Nodes run an off-the-shelf dynamically available protocol, take snapshots of the growing available ledger, and input them into a separate off-the-shelf BFT protocol to finalize a prefix. We explore connections with flexible BFT and improve upon the state-of-the-art for that problem.",

    "abstract": "In order to accommodate the ever-growing data from various, possibly independent, sources and the dynamic nature of data usage rates in practical applications, modern cloud data storage systems are required to be scalable, flexible, and heterogeneous. The recent rise of the blockchain technology is also moving various information systems towards decentralization to achieve high privacy at low costs. While codes with hierarchical locality have been intensively studied in the context of centralized cloud storage due to their effectiveness in reducing the average reading time, those for decentralized storage networks (DSNs) have not yet been discussed. In this paper, we propose a joint coding scheme where each node receives extra protection through the cooperation with nodes in its neighborhood in a heterogeneous DSN with any given topology. This work extends and subsumes our prior work on coding for centralized cloud storage. In particular, our proposed construction not only preserves desirable properties such as scalability and flexibility, which are critical in dynamic networks, but also adapts to arbitrary topologies, a property that is essential in DSNs but has been overlooked in existing works.",

There exist multiple BFT protocols to securely tolerate an optimal number of faults $t$ under different network settings.

Motivated by blockchain applications, we systematically study the forensic support of BFT protocols: we aim to identify (with cryptographic integrity) as many of the malicious replicas as possible, by as many participating replicas as possible and in as distributed manner as possible. Our main (positive) result is that well-known BFT protocols such as PBFT, HotStuff, and VABA have strong forensic support; we show that when $f$ exceeds $t$, at least $t+1$ of culpable replicas can be identified by at least $2t+1-f$ honest replicas. On the other hand, when $t$ is as much as half the number of replicas (e.g. in a synchronous network), then all but one of the malicious replicas must go undetected; this impossibility result holds for all BFT protocols and even if one has access to the states of all replicas (including Byzantine ones).",

For example, they will be able to barter files and data that they collect. Equally motivating, they will be able to barter and re-introduce to the economy items that they no longer need such as, books, garden tools, and bikes which are normally kept and wasted in garages and sheds. We argue that most of the pieces of technology needed for building a barter system are now available, including blockchains, smart contracts, cryptography, secure multiparty computations and fair exchange protocols.

The protocol is based on the longest chain and uses a Verifiable Delay Function for the block proposal lottery to provide an arrow of time. The security analysis of the protocol draws on the recently proposed technique of Nakamoto blocks as well as the theory of branching random walks. An additional feature of PoSAT is the complete unpredictability of who will get to propose a block next, even by the winner itself. This unpredictability is at the same level of PoW protocols, and is stronger than that of existing PoS protocols using Verifiable Random Functions.",

Unfortunately, there are still countries that hinder the portability of medical records. Numerous occurrences have shown that it still takes weeks for the medical data to be ported from one general physician (GP) to another. Cross border portability is nearly impossible due to the lack of technical infrastructure and standardization. We demonstrate the difficulty of the portability of medical records with some example case studies as a collaborative engagement exercise through a data mapping process to describe how different people and datapoints interact and evaluate EHR portability techniques.

In this paper, we answer this question by designing a new two-round BFT protocol called Fast-HotStuff, which enjoys responsiveness and efficient view change that is comparable to linear view change in terms of performance. Compared to (three-round) HotStuff, Fast-HotStuff has lower latency and is more resilient against certain attacks. Moreover, Fast-HotStuff provides friendly support for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) which is very important in blockchain applications.

The approach eliminates the reliance on the centralized and heavily intermediated mechanisms of existing payment applications. The construction progress is stored in a distributed manner using content addressable file sharing; it is broadcasted to a smart contract which automates the on-chain payment settlements and the transfer of lien rights. The method was successfully used for processing payments to 7 subcontractors in two commercial construction projects where progress monitoring was performed using a camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a laser scanner. The results show promise for the method's potential for increasing the frequency, granularity, and transparency of payments.

Nonetheless, we are aware of only a handful of randomized lower bounds. In this paper we provide a formal framework to reason about randomized distributed algorithms. We generalize the notion of indistinguishability, the most useful tool in deterministic lower bounds, to apply to a probabilistic setting. The power of this framework is applied to completely characterize the quality of decisions in the randomized multi-valued Consensus problem in an asynchronous environment with Byzantine faults. That is, we provide a tight bound on the probability of honest parties deciding on a possibly bogus value and prove that, in a precise sense, no algorithm can do better.",

Consensus is crucial for ordering transactions in failure-tolerant systems. Traditional consensus algorithms are homogeneous in three ways: - all learners are treated equally, - all acceptors are treated equally, and - all failures are treated equally. These assumptions, however, are unsuitable for cross-domain applications, including blockchains, where not all acceptors are equally trustworthy, and not all learners have the same assumptions and priorities. We present the first consensus algorithm to be heterogeneous in all three respects. Learners set their own mixed failure tolerances over differently trusted sets of acceptors. We express these assumptions in a novel $\\textit{Learner Graph}$, and demonstrate sufficient conditions for consensus. We present $\\textit{Heterogeneous Paxos}$: an extension of Byzantine Paxos. Heterogeneous Paxos achieves consensus for any viable Learner Graph in best-case three message sends, which is optimal. We present a proof-of-concept implementation, and demonstrate how tailoring for heterogeneous scenarios can save resources and latency.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of blockchain technology, there is a strong need for achieving interoperability between unconnected ledgers. Approaches such as hash time lock contracts (HTLCs) have arisen for cross-chain asset exchange. The solution embraces the likelihood of transaction failure and attempts to \"make the best out of worst\" by allowing transacting agents to at least keep their original assets in case of an abort. Nonetheless, as an undesired outcome, reoccurring transaction failures prompt a critical and analytical examination of the protocol. In this study, we propose a game-theoretic framework to study the strategic behaviors of agents taking part in cross-chain atomic swaps implemented with HTLCs. We study the success rate of the transaction as a function of the swap rate, the token price and its volatility, as well as other variables. We demonstrate that both agents might decide not to follow the protocol in an attempt to exploit price variations so as to maximize one's own utility. An extension of our model confirms that collateral deposits can improve the transaction success rate, and motivates further research towards collateralization without a trusted third party.",

    "abstract": "Internet technologies have made a paradigm shift in the fields of computing and data science and one such paradigm defining change is the Internet of Things or IoT. Nowadays, thousands of household appliances use integrated smart devices which allow remote monitoring and control and also allow intensive computational work such as high end AI-integrated smart security systems with sustained alerts for the user. The update process of these IoT devices usually lack the ability of checking the security of centralized servers, which may be compromised and host malicious firmware files as it is presumed that the servers are secure during deployment. The solution for this problem can be solved using a decentralized database to hold the hashes and the firmware. This paper discusses the possible implications of insecure servers used to host the firmwares of commercial IoT products, and aims to provide a blockchain based decentralized solution to host firmware files with the property of immutability, and controlled access to the firmware upload functions so as to stop unauthorized use. The paper sheds light over possible hardware implementations and the use of cryptographically secure components in such secure architecture models.",

Such business networks form when enterprises come together to derive value through a network which is greater than the value that can be derived solely by any single company. This results in a setting that combines both competitive and cooperative behavior, and which we call strategic coopetition. Traditionally, cooperative and competitive behavior have been analyzed separately in game theory. In this article, we provide a formal model enabling to jointly analyze these different types of behaviors and the interdependencies between them. Using this model, we formally demonstrate and analyze the incentives for both cooperative and competitive behavior.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system invented by Nakamoto in 2008. While it has attracted much research interest, its exact latency and security guarantees have not been rigorously established. Previous analyses of Bitcoin either focus on specific attacks or provide asymptotic bounds that are too loose for practical use. This paper describes a continuous-time model for blockchains and develops a rigorous analysis that yields very close latency (or confirmation time) and security bounds. For example, when the adversary controls 10\\% of the total mining power and the block propagation delays are within 10 seconds, a Bitcoin block is secured with less than $10^{-3}$ error probability after 5 hours 20 minutes of confirmation time, or with less than $10^{-10}$ error probability after 12 hours 15 minutes. These confirmation times are close to lower bounds due to a simple private attack. To establish the tight results, the mining of some special blocks are shown to be renewal processes. Moment generation functions of the inter-arrival times of those processes are derived in closed form. The general results are used to study the latency--security trade-off of several well-known proof-of-work longest-chain cryptocurrencies. Guidance is also provided on how to set parameters for different purposes.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts - computer protocols that regulate the exchange of crypto-assets in trustless environments - have become popular with the spread of blockchain technologies. A landmark security property of smart contracts is liquidity: in a non-liquid contract, it may happen that some assets remain frozen, i.e. not redeemable by anyone. The relevance of this issue is witnessed by recent liquidity attacks to Ethereum, which have frozen hundreds of USD millions. We address the problem of verifying liquidity on BitML, a DSL for smart contracts with a secure compiler to Bitcoin, featuring primitives for currency transfers, contract renegotiation and consensual recursion. Our main result is a verification technique for liquidity. We first transform the infinite-state semantics of BitML into a finite-state one, which focusses on the behaviour of a chosen set of contracts, abstracting from the moves of the context. With respect to the chosen contracts, this abstraction is sound, i.e. if the abstracted contract is liquid, then also the concrete one is such. We then verify liquidity by model-checking the finite-state abstraction. We implement a toolchain that automatically verifies liquidity of BitML contracts and compiles them to Bitcoin, and we assess it through a benchmark of representative contracts.",

The Ripple consensus protocol powers this network and is generally considered to a Byzantine fault-tolerant agreement protocol, which can reach consensus in the presence of faulty or malicious nodes. In contrast to traditional Byzantine agreement protocols, there is no global knowledge of all participating nodes in Ripple consensus; instead, each node declares a list of other nodes that it trusts and from which it considers votes. Previous work has brought up concerns about the liveness and safety of the consensus protocol under the general assumptions stated initially by Ripple, and there is currently no appropriate understanding of its workings and its properties in the literature. This paper closes this gap and makes two contributions. It first provides a detailed, abstract description of the protocol, which has been derived from the source code. Second, the paper points out that the abstract protocol may violate safety and liveness in several simple executions under relatively benign network assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Due to the widespread COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a push for `immunity passports' and even technical proposals. Although the debate about the medical and ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has been less inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes. These schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test and vaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemes have involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity standards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents that have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the questionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity passports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of `cryptography theater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to allay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization. Deployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity' in use-cases like immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity totalitarianism.",

Most existing development processes use formal methods in the late stage and unable to guide the design and implementation, which seems to improve producibility and speed up delivery, but in fact brings huge potential risk and cost. In this paper, we formulate an iterative and incremental development process, named formalism-driven development (FDD), for developing provably correct decentralized systems under the guidance of formal methods. Besides, a framework is presented to practicalize FDD with a parallelable branching workflow and scaffolds including a new modeling language and generators to smooth the stage transition. Furthermore, we use a blockchain prototype developed with our framework as an instance to concretize the core concepts of FDD and demonstrate the effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "We argue for giving users the ability to lease bandwidth temporarily from any mobile network operator. We propose, prototype, and evaluate a spectrum market for mobile network access, where multiple network operators offer blocks of bandwidth at specified prices for short-term leases to users, with autonomous agents on user devices making purchase decisions by trading off price, performance, and budget constraints. We show that the problem of provider selection can be formulated as a so-called Bandit problem. For the case where providers change prices synchronously, we approach the problem through contextual multi-armed bandits and Reinforcement Learning methods like Q-learning either applied directly to the bandit maximization problem or indirectly to approximate the Gittins indices that are known to yield the optimal provider selection policy. For a simulated scenario corresponding to a practical use case, our agent shows a $20-41\\%$ QoE improvement over random provider selection under various demand, price and mobility conditions. We implemented a prototype spectrum market using LTE networks and eSIM techology and deployed it on a testbed, using a blockchain to implement the ledger where bandwidth purchase transactions are recorded. Experiments showed that we can learn both user behavior and network performance efficiently, and recorded $25-74\\%$ improvements in QoE under various competing agent scenarios.",

To benefit more individuals lacking data and models, a convenient approach is needed which enables the trained models from various sources for prediction serving, but it has yet to truly take off considering three issues: (i) incentivizing prediction truthfulness; (ii) boosting prediction accuracy; (iii) protecting model privacy. We design FedServing, a federated prediction serving framework, achieving the three issues. First, we customize an incentive mechanism based on Bayesian game theory which ensures that joining providers at a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium will provide truthful (not meaningless) predictions. Second, working jointly with the incentive mechanism, we employ truth discovery algorithms to aggregate truthful but possibly inaccurate predictions for boosting prediction accuracy. Third, providers can locally deploy their models and their predictions are securely aggregated inside TEEs. Attractively, our design supports popular prediction formats, including top-1 label, ranked labels and posterior probability. Besides, blockchain is employed as a complementary component to enforce exchange fairness. By conducting extensive experiments, we validate the expected properties of our design. We also empirically demonstrate that FedServing reduces the risk of certain membership inference attack.",

Existing machine-learning-based static analysis tools for vulnerability detection need features, which analysts create manually, as inputs. In contrast, Eth2Vec automatically learns features of vulnerable Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecodes with tacit knowledge through a neural network for language processing. Therefore, Eth2Vec can detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts by comparing the code similarity between target EVM bytecodes and the EVM bytecodes it already learned. We conducted experiments with existing open databases, such as Etherscan, and our results show that Eth2Vec outperforms the existing work in terms of well-known metrics, i.e., precision, recall, and F1-score.

Bitcoin's security lies in a proof-of-work scheme, which requires high computational resources at the miners.

Mobile devices can only accommodate mobile applications (wallets) that allow users to exchange credits of cryptocurrencies. In this work, we propose LocalCoin, an alternative cryptocurrency that requires minimal computational resources, produces low data traffic and works with off-the-shelf mobile devices. LocalCoin replaces the computational hardness that is at the root of Bitcoin's security with the social hardness of ensuring that all witnesses to a transaction are colluders. Localcoin features (i) a lightweight proof-of-work scheme and (ii) a distributed blockchain. We analyze LocalCoin for double spending for passive and active attacks and prove that under the assumption of sufficient number of users and properly selected tuning parameters the probability of double spending is close to zero. Extensive simulations on real mobility traces, realistic urban settings, and random geometric graphs show that the probability of success of one transaction converges to 1 and the probability of the success of a double spending attempt converges to 0.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, a number of lightweight programs have been deployed in critical domains, such as in smart contracts based on blockchain technology. Therefore, the security and reliability of such programs should be guaranteed by the most credible technology. Higher-order logic theorem proving is one of the most reliable technologies for verifying the properties of programs. However, programs may be developed by different high-level programming languages, and a general, extensible, and reusable formal memory (GERM) framework that can simultaneously support different formal verification specifications, particularly at the code level, is presently unavailable for verifying the properties of programs. Therefore, the present work proposes a GERM framework to fill this gap. The framework simulates physical memory hardware structure, including a low-level formal memory space, and provides a set of simple, nonintrusive application programming interfaces and assistant tools using Coq that can support different formal verification specifications simultaneously. The proposed GERM framework is independent and customizable, and was verified entirely in Coq. We also present an extension of Curry-Howard isomorphism, denoted as execution-verification isomorphism (EVI), which combines symbolic execution and theorem proving for increasing the degree of automation in higher-order logic theorem proving assistant tools. We also implement a toy functional programming language in a generalized algebraic datatypes style and a formal interpreter in Coq based on the GERM framework. These implementations are then employed to demonstrate the application of EVI to a simple code segment.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the recent trend towards in-browser mining of cryptocurrencies; in particular, the mining of Monero through Coinhive and similar code- bases. In this model, a user visiting a website will download a JavaScript code that executes client-side in her browser, mines a cryptocurrency, typically without her consent or knowledge, and pays out the seigniorage to the website. Websites may consciously employ this as an alternative or to supplement advertisement revenue, may offer premium content in exchange for mining, or may be unwittingly serving the code as a result of a breach (in which case the seigniorage is collected by the attacker). The cryptocurrency Monero is preferred seemingly for its unfriendliness to large-scale ASIC mining that would drive browser-based efforts out of the market, as well as for its purported privacy features. In this paper, we survey this landscape, conduct some measurements to establish its prevalence and profitability, outline an ethical framework for considering whether it should be classified as an attack or business opportunity, and make suggestions for the detection, mitigation and/or prevention of browser-based mining for non- consenting users.",

    "abstract": "Millions of shipping containers filled with goods move around the world every day. Before such a container may enter a trade bloc, the customs agency of the goods' destination country must ensure that it does not contain illegal or mislabeled goods. Due to the high volume of containers, customs agencies make a selection of containers to audit through a risk analysis procedure. Customs agencies perform risk analysis using data sourced from a centralized system that is potentially vulnerable to manipulation and malpractice. Therefore we propose an alternative: DEFenD, a decentralized system that stores data about goods and containers in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. In our system, economic operators make claims to the network about goods they insert into or remove from containers, and encrypt these claims so that they can only be read by the destination country's customs agency. Economic operators also make unencrypted claims about containers with which they interact. Unencrypted claims can be validated by the entire network of customs agencies. Our key contribution is a data partitioning scheme and several protocols that enable such a system to utilize blockchain and its powerful validation principle, while also preserving the privacy of the involved economic operators. Using our protocol, customs agencies can improve their risk analysis and economic operators can get through customs with less delay. We also present a reference implementation built with Hyperledger Fabric and analyze to what extent our implementation meets the requirements in terms of privacy-preservation, security, scalability, and decentralization.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the formal syntax and semantics for a large subset of the Solidity programming language developed for the Etheruem blockchain platform based on our resent work about developing a general, extensible, and reusable formal memory (GERM) framework and an extension of Curry-Howard isomorphism, denoted as execution-verification isomorphism (EVI). This subset is denoted as Lolisa, which, to our knowledge, is the first mechanized and validated formal syntax and semantics developed for Solidity. The formal syntax of Lolisa adopts a stronger static type system than Solidity for enhanced type safety. In addition, Lolisa not only includes nearly all the syntax components of Solidity, such as mapping, modifier, contract, and address types, but it also contains general-purpose programming language features, such as multiple return values, pointer arithmetic, struct, and field access. Therefore, the inherent compatibility of Lolisa allows Solidity programs to be directly translated into Lolisa with a line-by-line correspondence without rebuilding or abstracting, and, in addition, the inherent generality of Lolisa allows it to be extended to express other programming languages as well. To this end, we also present a preliminary scheme for extending Lolisa to other languages systematically.",

    "abstract": "The functionality that distributed ledger technology provides, i.e., an immutable and fraud-resistant registry with validation and verification mechanisms, has traditionally been implemented with a trusted third party. Due to the distributed nature of ledger technology, there is a strong recent trend towards using ledgers to implement novel decentralized applications for a wide range of use cases, e.g., in the financial sector and sharing economy. While there can be several arguments for the use of a ledger, the key question is whether it can fully replace any single trusted party in the system as otherwise a (potentially simpler) solution can be built around the trusted party. In this paper, we introduce an abstract view on ledger use cases and present two fundamental criteria that must be met for any use case to be implemented using a ledger-based approach without having to rely on any particular party in the system. Moreover, we evaluate several ledger use cases that have recently received considerable attention according to these criteria, revealing that often participants need to trust each other despite using a distributed ledger. Consequently, the potential of using a ledger as a replacement for a trusted party is limited for these use cases.",

    "abstract": "Today's storage systems expose abstractions which are either too low-level (e.g., key-value store, raw-block store) that they require developers to re-invent the wheels, or too high-level (e.g., relational databases, Git) that they lack generality to support many classes of applications. In this work, we propose and implement a general distributed data storage system, called UStore, which has rich semantics. UStore delivers three key properties, namely immutability, sharing and security, which unify and add values to many classes of today's applications, and which also open the door for new applications. By keeping the core properties within the storage, UStore helps reduce application development efforts while offering high performance at hand. The storage embraces current hardware trends as key enablers. It is built around a data-structure similar to that of Git, a popular source code versioning system, but it also synthesizes many designs from distributed systems and databases. Our current implementation of UStore has better performance than general in-memory key-value storage systems, especially for version scan operations. We port and evaluate four applications on top of UStore: a Git-like application, a collaborative data science application, a transaction management application, and a blockchain application. We demonstrate that UStore enables faster development and the UStore-backed applications can have better performance than the existing implementations.",

As opposed to previous algorithms that cannot terminate in the presence of a faulty or slow coordinator, our algorithm can terminate even when its coordinator is faulty, hence the name weak coordinator. The key idea is to allow processes to complete asynchronous rounds as soon as they receive a threshold of messages, instead of having to wait for a message from a coordinator that may be slow. The resulting algorithm assumes partial synchrony, is resilience optimal, time optimal and does not need signatures. Our presentation is didactic: we first present a simple safe binary Byzantine consensus algorithm, modify it to ensure termination, and finally present an optimized reduction from multivalue consensus to binary consensus that may terminate in 4 message delays. To evaluate our algorithm, we deployed it on 100 machines distributed in 5 datacenters across different continents and compared its performance against the randomized solution from Mostefaoui, Moumem and Raynal [PODC14] that terminates in O(1) rounds in expectation. Our algorithm always outperforms the latter even in the presence of Byzantine behaviors. Our algorithm has a subsecond average latency in most of our geo-distributed experiments, even when attacked by a well-engineered coalition of Byzantine processes.",

    "abstract": "Stratum, the de-facto mining communication protocol used by blockchain based cryptocurrency systems, enables miners to reliably and efficiently fetch jobs from mining pool servers. In this paper we exploit Stratum's lack of encryption to develop passive and active attacks on Bitcoin's mining protocol, with important implications on the privacy, security and even safety of mining equipment owners. We introduce StraTap and ISP Log attacks, that infer miner earnings if given access to miner communications, or even their logs. We develop BiteCoin, an active attack that hijacks shares submitted by miners, and their associated payouts. We build BiteCoin on WireGhost, a tool we developed to hijack and surreptitiously maintain Stratum connections. Our attacks reveal that securing Stratum through pervasive encryption is not only undesirable (due to large overheads), but also ineffective: an adversary can predict miner earnings even when given access to only packet timestamps. Instead, we devise Bedrock, a minimalistic Stratum extension that protects the privacy and security of mining participants. We introduce and leverage the mining cookie concept, a secret that each miner shares with the pool and includes in its puzzle computations, and that prevents attackers from reconstructing or hijacking the puzzles. We have implemented our attacks and collected 138MB of Stratum protocol traffic from mining equipment in the US and Venezuela. We show that Bedrock is resilient to active attacks even when an adversary breaks the crypto constructs it uses. Bedrock imposes a daily overhead of 12.03s on a single pool server that handles mining traffic from 16,000 miners.",

In this paper, we empirically evaluate two weaknesses in Monero's mixin sampling strategy. First, about 62% of transaction inputs with one or more mixins are vulnerable to \"chain-reaction\" analysis -- that is, the real input can be deduced by elimination. Second, Monero mixins are sampled in such a way that they can be easily distinguished from the real coins by their age distribution; in short, the real input is usually the \"newest\" input. We estimate that this heuristic can be used to guess the real input with 80% accuracy over all transactions with 1 or more mixins. Next, we turn to the Monero ecosystem and study the importance of mining pools and the former anonymous marketplace AlphaBay on the transaction volume. We find that after removing mining pool activity, there remains a large amount of potentially privacy-sensitive transactions that are affected by these weaknesses. We propose and evaluate two countermeasures that can improve the privacy of future transactions.",

    "abstract": "Orbital debris remains as an obstacle to further space development. While efforts are ongoing to avoid newly launched objects becoming debris, the number of debris would still continue to grow because of collisions. ADR (Active Debris Removal) is an effective measure, but building a sustainable economic model for ADR remains as a difficult problem. We propose that the cost of removal can be paid by circulating digital currency tokens on a blockchain platform whose values may decrease and/or increase over time, issued by global cooperation (a consortium) of parties interested in space development, in exchange with proofs of ADR. The tokens pay their cost by themselves through contributions by the token holders, who are likely to be benefited by removal of debris. This scheme imposes virtually no cost to the consortium. We have generalized this concept as POD (Proof of Disposal), which, we believe, provides a more accountable foundation for solving social problems with digital currency than many ICO (Initial Coin or Cryptoasset Offering) in practice today. We evaluated the feasibility of our proposal through a simulation. We conclude that dynamic estimation of the economic values of each ADR and automated pricing of tokens that represent the orbital debris being removed are indeed possible. Actual prototyping of the proposed digital currency system is ongoing.",

Combining a distributed ledger with existing mechanisms for security in V2X communication systems, we design a distributed event data recorder (EDR) that satisfies traditional accountability requirements by providing a compressed global state. Unlike previous approaches, our distributed ledger solution provides an accountable revocation mechanism without requiring trust in a single misbehavior authority, instead allowing a collaborative and transparent decision making process through Blackchain. This makes Blackchain an attractive alternative to existing solutions for revocation in a Security Credential Management System (SCMS), which suffer from the traditional disadvantages of PKIs, notably including centralized trust. Our proposal becomes scalable through the use of hierarchical consensus: individual vehicles dynamically create clusters, which then provide their consensus decisions as input for road-side units (RSUs), which in turn publish their results to misbehavior authorities. This authority, which is traditionally a single entity in the SCMS, responsible for the integrity of the entire V2X network, is now a set of authorities that transparently perform a revocation, whose result is then published in a global Blackchain state. This state can be used to prevent the issuance of certificates to previously malicious users, and also prevents the authority from misbehaving through the transparency implied by a global system state.",

These trends raise the need for new paradigms for distribution grids operation, in which Distribution System Operators will increasingly rely on demand side flexibility and households will progressively become prosumers playing an active role on smart grid energy management. However, in present energy management architectures, the lack of coordination among actors limits the capability of the grid to enable the mentioned trends. In this paper we tackle this problem by proposing an architecture that enables households to autonomously exchange energy blocks and flexibility services with neighbors, operators and market actors. The solution is based on a blockchain transactive platform. We focus on a market application, where households can trade energy with their neighbors, aimed to locally balancing renewable energy production. We propose a market mechanism and dynamic transport prices that provide an incentive for households to locally manage energy resources in a way that responds to both pro-sumer and operator needs. We evaluate the impact of such markets through comprehensive simulations using power flow analysis and realistic load profiles, providing valuable insight for the design of appropriate mechanisms and incentives.",

In order to properly integrate demand-side flexibility, DSOs need new energy management architectures, capable of fostering collaboration with wholesale market actors and pro-sumers. We propose the creation of Virtual Distribution Grids (VDG) over a common physical infrastructure , to cope with heterogeneity of resources and actors, and with the increasing complexity of distribution grid management and related resources allocation problems. Focusing on residential VDG, we propose an agent-based hierarchical architecture for providing Demand-Side Management services through a market-based approach, where households transact their surplus/lack of energy and their flexibility with neighbours, aggregators, utilities and DSOs. For implementing the overall solution, we consider fine-grained control of smart homes based on Inter-net of Things technology. Homes seamlessly transact self-enforcing smart contracts over a blockchain-based generic platform.

Furthermore, to enhance this learning process, the knowledge sharing among multiple robot units is the natural step forward. However, to date, there is no well-established framework which allows for such data sharing while preserving the privacy of the users (e.g., the hospital patients). To this end, we introduce RoboChain - the first learning framework for secure, decentralized and computationally efficient data and model sharing among multiple robot units installed at multiple sites (e.g., hospitals). RoboChain builds upon and combines the latest advances in open data access and blockchain technologies, as well as machine learning. We illustrate this framework using the example of a clinical intervention conducted in a private network of hospitals. Specifically, we lay down the system architecture that allows multiple robot units, conducting the interventions at different hospitals, to perform efficient learning without compromising the data privacy.",

In brief, we define a ledger object as a sequence of records, and we provide the operations and the properties that such an object should support. Implementation of a ledger object on top of multiple (possibly geographically dispersed) computing devices gives rise to the distributed ledger object. In contrast to the centralized object, distribution allows operations to be applied concurrently on the ledger, introducing challenges on the consistency of the ledger in each participant. We provide the definitions of three well known consistency guarantees in terms of the operations supported by the ledger object: (1) atomic consistency (linearizability), (2) sequential consistency, and (3) eventual consistency. We then provide implementations of distributed ledgers on asynchronous message passing crash-prone systems using an Atomic Broadcast service, and show that they provide eventual, sequential or atomic consistency semantics. We conclude with a variation of the ledger - the validated ledger - which requires that each record in the ledger satisfies a particular validation rule.",

We implement this method on-top-of the GraphSense open-source platform and apply it to empirically analyze transactions related to 35 ransomware families. We estimate the lower bound direct financial impact of each ransomware family and find that, from 2013 to mid-2017, the market for ransomware payments has a minimum worth of USD 12,768,536 (22,967.54 BTC). We also find that the market is highly skewed with only a few number of players responsible for the majority of the payments. Based on these research findings, policy-makers and law enforcement agencies can use the statistics provided to understand the size of the illicit market and make informed decisions on how best to address the threat.",

For this reason, we present ongoing work on a configuration management system (CMS) that provides control over administrators, restrains their rights, and enforces separation of concerns. We reach this goal by conducting a configuration management process that requires multi-party authorization for critical configurations to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance against attacks and faults by administrators. Only after a configuration has been authorized by multiple experts, it is applied to the targeted devices. For the whole configuration management process, our CMS guarantees accountability and traceability. Lastly, our system is tamper-resistant as we leverage Hyperledger Fabric, which provides a distributed execution environment for our CMS and a blockchain-based distributed ledger that we use to store the configurations. A beneficial side effect of this approach is that our CMS is also suitable to manage configurations for infrastructure shared across different organizations that do not need to trust each other.",

    "abstract": "Proof-of-Stake systems randomly choose, on each round, one of the participants as a consensus leader that extends the chain with the next block such that the selection probability is proportional to the owned stake. However, distributed random number generation is notoriously difficult. Systems that derive randomness from the previous blocks are completely insecure; solutions that provide secure random selection are inefficient due to their high communication complexity; and approaches that balance security and performance exhibit selection bias. When block creation is rewarded with new stake, even a minor bias can have a severe cumulative effect. In this paper, we propose Robust Round Robin, a new consensus scheme that addresses this selection problem. We create reliable long-term identities by bootstrapping from an existing infrastructure, such as Intel's SGX processors, or by mining them starting from an initial fair distribution. For leader selection we use a deterministic approach. On each round, we select a set of the previously created identities as consensus leader candidates in round robin manner. Because simple round-robin alone is vulnerable to attacks and offers poor liveness, we complement such deterministic selection policy with a lightweight endorsement mechanism that is an interactive protocol between the leader candidates and a small subset of other system participants. Our solution has low good efficiency as it requires no expensive distributed randomness generation and it provides block creation fairness which is crucial in deployments that reward it with new stake.",

    "abstract": "We consider users which may have renewable energy harvesting devices, or distributed generators. Such users can behave as consumer or producer (hence, we denote them as prosumers) at different time instances. A prosumer may sell the energy to other prosumers in exchange of money. We consider a demand response model, where the price of conventional energy depends on the total demand of all the prosumers at a certain time. A prosumer depending on its own utility has to select the amount of energy it wants to buy either from the grid or from other prosumers, or the amount of excess energy it wants to sell to other prosumers. However, the strategy, and the payoff of a prosumer inherently depends on the strategy of other prosumers as a prosumer can only buy if the other prosumers are willing to sell. We formulate the problem as a coupled constrained game, and seek to obtain the generalized Nash equilibrium. We show that the game is a concave potential game and show that there exists a unique generalized Nash equilibrium. We consider that a platform will set the price for distributed interchange of energy among the prosumers in order to minimize the consumption of the conventional energy. We propose a distributed algorithm where the platform sets a price to each prosumer, and then each prosumer at a certain time only optimizes its own payoff. The prosumer then updates the price depending on the supply and demand for each prosumer. We show that the algorithm converges to an optimal generalized Nash equilibrium. The distributed algorithm also provides an optimal price for the exchange market.",

Our mechanisms are parameterized by a target value for the desired number of pools. We show that by properly incentivizing participants, the desired number of stake pools is a Nash equilibrium arising from rational play. Our equilibria also exhibit an efficiency / security tradeoff via a parameter that calibrates between including pools with the smallest cost and providing protection against Sybil attacks, the setting where a single stakeholder creates a large number of pools in the hopes to dominate the collaborative project. We then describe how RSS can be deployed in the PoS setting, mitigating a number of potential deployment attacks and protocol deviations that include censoring transactions, performing Sybil attacks with the objective to control the majority of stake, lying about the actual cost and others. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate fast convergence to equilibria in dynamic environments where players react to each other's strategic moves over an indefinite period of interactive play. We also show how simple reward sharing schemes that are seemingly more \"fair\", perhaps counterintuitively, converge to centralized equilibria.",

    "abstract": "Ethereum smart contracts are an innovation built on top of the blockchain technology, which provides a platform for automatically executing contracts in an anonymous, distributed, and trusted way. The problem is magnified by the fact that smart contracts, unlike ordinary programs, cannot be patched easily once deployed. It is important for smart contracts to be checked against potential vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to automatically identify critical program paths (with multiple function calls including inter-contract function calls) in a smart contract, rank the paths according to their criticalness, discard them if they are infeasible or otherwise present them with user friendly warnings for user inspection. We identify paths which involve monetary transaction as critical paths, and prioritize those which potentially violate important properties. For scalability, symbolic execution techniques are only applied to top ranked critical paths. Our approach has been implemented in a tool called sCompile, which has been applied to 36,099 smart contracts. The experiment results show that sCompile is efficient, i.e., 5 seconds on average for one smart contract. Furthermore, we show that many known vulnerabilities can be captured if user inspects as few as 10 program paths generated by sCompile. Lastly, sCompile discovered 224 unknown vulnerabilities with a false positive rate of 15.4% before user inspection.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has received great attention in recent years and motivated innovations in different scenarios. However, many vital issues which affect its performance are still open. For example, it is widely convinced that high level of security and scalability and full decentralization are still impossible to achieve simultaneously. In this paper, we propose Bicomp, a bilayer scalable Nakamoto consensus protocol, which is an approach based on high security and pure decentralized Nakamoto consensus, and with a significant improvement on scalability. In Bicomp, two kinds of blocks are generated, i.e., microblocks for concurrent transaction packaging in network, and macroblocks for leadership competition and chain formation. A leader is elected at beginning of each round by using a macroblock header from proof-of-work. An elected leader then receives and packages multiple microblocks mined by different nodes into one macroblock during its tenure, which results in a bilayer block structure. Such design limits a leader's power and encourages as many nodes as possible to participate in the process of packaging transactions, which promotes the sharding nature of the system. Furthermore, several mechanisms are carefully designed to reduce transaction overlapping and further limit a leader's power, among which a novel transaction diversity based metric is proposed as the second level criteria besides the longest-chain-first principle on selecting a legitimate chain when fork happens. Security issues and potential attacks to Bicomp are extensively discussed and experiments for evaluation are performed. From the experimental results based on 50 nodes all over the world, Bicomp achieves significant improvement on scalability than that of Bitcoin and Ethereum, while the security and decentralization merits are still preserved.",

We first study a scenario where the reward is offered for solving the problem, such as in blockchain mining. We show that, in Markov perfect equilibrium, players with cost parameters exceeding a certain threshold, do not invest; while those with cost parameters less than this threshold, invest maximal power. Here, players need not know the system state. We then consider a scenario where the reward is offered for contributing to the computational power of a common central entity, such as in volunteer computing. Here, in Markov perfect equilibrium, only players with cost parameters in a relatively low range in a given state, invest. For the case where players are homogeneous, they invest proportionally to the 'reward to cost' ratio. For both the scenarios, we study the effects of players' arrival and departure rates on their utilities using simulations and provide additional insights.",

This paper introduces an Intelligent Industrial Network (DSDIN), which provides a fully distributed manufacturing network where everyone can participate in manufacturing due to decentralization and no intermediate links, allowing them to quickly get the products or services they want and also to be authorized, recognized and get returns in a low-cost way due to their efforts (such as providing creative ideas, designs or equipment, raw materials or physical strength). DSDIN is a blockchain based IoT and AI technology platform, and also an IoT based intelligent service standard. Due to the intelligent network formed by DSDIN, the manufacturing center is no longer a factory, and actually there are no manufacturing centers. DSDIN provides a multi-participation peer-to-peer network for people and things (including raw materials, equipment, finished / semi-finished products, etc.). The information transmitted through the network is called Intelligent Service Algorithm (ISA). The user can send a process model, formula or control parameter to a device via an ISA, and every transaction in DSDIN is an intelligent service defined by ISA.",

    "abstract": "Distributed consensus is a key enabler for many distributed systems including distributed databases and blockchains. Canopus is a scalable distributed consensus protocol that ensures that live nodes in a system agree on an ordered sequence of operations (called transactions). Unlike most prior consensus protocols, Canopus does not rely on a single leader. Instead, it uses a virtual tree overlay for message dissemination to limit network traffic across oversubscribed links. It leverages hardware redundancies, both within a rack and inside the network fabric, to reduce both protocol complexity and communication overhead. These design decisions enable Canopus to support large deployments without significant performance degradation. The existing Canopus protocol is resilient in the face of node and communication failures, but its focus is primarily on performance, so does not respond well to other types of failures. For example, the failure of a single rack of servers causes all live nodes to stall. The protocol is also open to attack by Byzantine nodes, which can cause different live nodes to conclude the protocol with different transaction orders. In this paper, we describe RCanopus (`resilent Canopus') which extends Canopus to add liveness, that is, allowing live nodes to make progress, when possible, despite many types of failures. This requires RCanopus to accurately detect and recover from failure despite using unreliable failure detectors, and tolerance of Byzantine attacks. Second, RCanopus guarantees safety, that is, agreement amongst live nodes of transaction order, in the presence of Byzantine attacks and network partitioning.",

With Blockchains gaining traction, we can implement CC in a reliable, transparent, and secure manner with smart contracts (SCs). The fundamental challenge in CC is free-riding. PPR, the proposal by Zubrickas [23] of giving refund bonus to the contributors, in the case of the project not getting provisioned, has attractive properties. However, as observed by Chandra et al. [7], PPR faces a challenge wherein the agents defer their contribution until the deadline. We define this delaying of contributions as a race condition. To address this, their proposal, PPS, considers the temporal aspects of a contribution. However, PPS is computationally complex, expensive to implement as an SC, and it being sophisticated, it is difficult to explain to a layperson. In this work, our goal is to identify all essential properties a refund bonus scheme must satisfy in order to curb free-riding while avoiding the race condition. We prove Contribution Monotonicity and Time Monotonicity are sufficient conditions for this. We propose three elegant refund bonus schemes satisfying these two conditions leading to three novel mechanisms for CC - PPRG, PPRE, and PPRP. We show that PPRG is the most cost-effective mechanism when deployed as an SC. We show that under certain modest assumptions on valuations of the agents, in PPRG, the project is funded at equilibrium.",

With the recent proliferation of alternative cryptocurrencies, however, it becomes relevant to ask not only whether ornot money can be traced as it moves within the ledgerof a single cryptocurrency, but if it can in fact be tracedas it moves across ledgers. This is especially pertinent given the rise in popularity of automated trading platforms such as ShapeShift, which make it effortless to carry out such cross-currency trades. In this paper, weuse data scraped from ShapeShift over a thirteen-monthperiod and the data from eight different blockchains to explore this question. Beyond developing new heuristics and creating new types of links across cryptocurrency ledgers, we also identify various patterns of cross-currency trades and of the general usage of these platforms, with the ultimate goal of understanding whetherthey serve a criminal or a profit-driven agenda.",

Being inherently digital, all Bitcoin-related fundamental data (from exchanges, as well as transactional data directly from the blockchain) is available online, something that is not true for traditional businesses or currencies traded on exchanges. This makes Bitcoin an interesting subject for such research, as it enables the mapping of sentiment to fundamental events that might otherwise be inaccessible. Furthermore, Bitcoin discussion largely takes place on online forums and chat channels. In stock trading, the value of sentiment data in trading decisions has been demonstrated numerous times [1] [2] [3], and this research aims to determine whether there is value in such data for Bitcoin trading models. To achieve this, data over the year 2015 has been collected from Bitcointalk.org, (the biggest Bitcoin forum in post volume), established news sources such as Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, the complete /r/btc and /r/Bitcoin subreddits, and the bitcoin-otc and bitcoin-dev IRC channels. By analyzing this data on sentiment and volume, we find weak to moderate correlations between forum, news, and Reddit sentiment and movements in price and volume from 1 to 5 days after the sentiment was expressed. A Granger causality test confirms the predictive causality of the sentiment on the daily percentage price and volume movements, and at the same time underscores the predictive causality of market movements on sentiment expressions in online communities",

While some symbolic tools perform complex analysis steps, they require a predetermined invocation depth to search vulnerable execution paths, and the search time increases with depth. The number of contracts on blockchains like Ethereum has increased 176 fold since December 2015. If these symbolic tools fail to analyze the increasingly large number of contracts in time, entire classes of exploits could cause irrevocable damage. In this paper, we aim to have safer smart contracts against emerging threats. We propose the approach of sequential learning of smart contract weaknesses using machine learning---long-short term memory (LSTM)---that allows us to be able to detect new attack trends relatively quickly, leading to safer smart contracts. Our experimental studies on 620,000 smart contracts prove that our model can easily scale to analyze a massive amount of contracts; that is, the LSTM maintains near constant analysis time as contracts increase in complexity. In addition, our approach achieves $99\\%$ test accuracy and correctly analyzes contracts that were false positive (FP) errors made by a symbolic tool.",

    "abstract": "Token Curated Registries (TCR) are decentralized recommendation systems that can be implemented using Blockchain smart contracts. They allow participants to vote for or against adding items to a list through a process that involves staking tokens intrinsic to the registry, with winners receiving the staked tokens for each vote. A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated list. In this work, we consider a challenge for these systems - incentivizing token-holders to actually engage and participate in the voting process. We propose a novel token-inflation mechanism for enhancing engagement, whereby only voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined multiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a simple 4-class model of voters that captures all possible combinations of two key dimensions: whether they are engaged (likely to vote at all for a given item) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote in a way that increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to evaluate the quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct simulations using this model of voters and show that implementing token-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for engaged voters. In particular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our simulations show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the greatest benefits from participating in the registry when our proposed token-inflation mechanism is employed. We further validate this finding using a simplified mathematical analysis.",

However, this process assumes a trusted centralized infrastructure for coordination, and clients must trust that the central service does not use the byproducts of client data. In addition to this, a group of malicious clients could also harm the performance of the model by carrying out a poisoning attack. As a response, we propose Biscotti: a fully decentralized peer to peer (P2P) approach to multi-party ML, which uses blockchain and cryptographic primitives to coordinate a privacy-preserving ML process between peering clients. Our evaluation demonstrates that Biscotti is scalable, fault tolerant, and defends against known attacks. For example, Biscotti is able to protect the privacy of an individual client's update and the performance of the global model at scale when 30% of adversaries are trying to poison the model.

As with other consequences of the MSS theorem, it is not clear how one would explicitly construct such a subgraph. We show that such a subgraph (although with quantitatively weaker expansion and near-regularity properties than those predicted by MSS) can be constructed with high probability in linear time, via a simple algorithm. Our algorithm allows a distributed implementation that runs in $\\mathcal O(\\log n)$ rounds and does $\\mathcal O(n)$ total work with high probability. The analysis of the algorithm is complicated by the complex dependencies that arise between edges and between choices made in different rounds. We sidestep these difficulties by following the combinatorial approach of counting the number of possible random choices of the algorithm which lead to failure. We do so by a compression argument showing that such random choices can be encoded with a non-trivial compression. Our algorithm bears some similarity to the way agents construct a communication graph in a peer-to-peer network, and, in the bipartite case, to the way agents select servers in blockchain protocols.",

    "abstract": "The edge of the network has the potential to host services for supporting a variety of user applications, ranging in complexity from data preprocessing, image and video rendering, and interactive gaming, to embedded systems in autonomous cars and built environments. However, the computational and data resources over which such services are hosted, and the actors that interact with these services, have an intermittent availability and access profile, introducing significant risk for user applications that must rely on them. This article investigates the development of an edge marketplace, which is able to support multiple providers for offering services at the network edge, and to enable demand supply for influencing the operation of such a marketplace. Resilience, cost, and quality of service and experience will subsequently enable such a marketplace to adapt its services over time. This article also describes how distributed-ledger technologies (such as blockchains) provide a promising approach to support the operation of such a marketplace and regulate its behavior (such as the GDPR in Europe) and operation. Two application scenarios provide context for the discussion of how such a marketplace would function and be utilized in practice.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by applications in blockchains and sensor networks, we consider a model of $n$ nodes trying to reach consensus on their majority bit. Each node $i$ is assigned a bit at time zero, and is a finite automaton with $m$ bits of memory (i.e., $2^m$ states) and a Poisson clock. When the clock of $i$ rings, $i$ can choose to communicate, and is then matched to a uniformly chosen node $j$. The nodes $j$ and $i$ may update their states based on the state of the other node. Previous work has focused on minimizing the time to consensus and the probability of error, while our goal is minimizing the number of communications. We show that when $m>3 \\log\\log\\log(n)$, consensus can be reached at linear communication cost, but this is impossible if $m<\\log\\log\\log(n)$. We also study a synchronous variant of the model, where our upper and lower bounds on $m$ for achieving linear communication cost are $2\\log\\log\\log(n)$ and $\\log\\log\\log(n)$, respectively. A key step is to distinguish when nodes can become aware of knowing the majority bit and stop communicating. We show that this is impossible if their memory is too low.",

    "abstract": "Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable energy and improvements in battery technology. Prompted by the increasing complexity of power systems, decentralized IoT solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. The core functionality of these solutions is to provide mechanisms for matching producers with consumers while ensuring system safety. However, there are multiple challenges that these solutions still face: privacy, trust, and resilience. The privacy challenge arises because the time series of production and consumption data for each participant is sensitive and may be used to infer personal information. Trust is an issue because a producer or consumer can renege on the promised energy transfer. Providing resilience is challenging due to the possibility of failures in the infrastructure that is required to support these market based solutions. In this paper, we develop a rigorous solution for transactive microgrids that addresses all three challenges by providing an innovative combination of MILP solvers, smart contracts, and publish-subscribe middleware within a framework of a novel distributed application platform, called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid. Towards this purpose, we describe the key architectural concepts, including fault tolerance, and show the trade-off between market efficiency and resource requirements.",

    "abstract": "Distributed ledger and blockchain systems are expected to make financial systems easier to audit, reduce counter-party risk and transfer assets seamlessly. The key concept is a token controlled by a cryptographic private key for spending, and represented by a public key for receiving and audit purposes. Ownership transfers are authorized with digital signatures and recorded on a ledger visible to numerous participants. Several ways to enhance the privacy of such ledgers have been proposed. In this paper we study two major techniques to enhance privacy of token transfers with the help of improved cryptography: M\\\"obius and CryptoNote. The comparison is illuminating: both techniques use \"ring signatures\" and some form of \"stealth addressing\" or key derivation techniques, yet each does it in a completely different way. M\\\"obius is more recent and operates in a more co-operative way (with permission) and is not yet specified at a sufficiently detailed level. Our primary goal is to explore the suitability of these two techniques for improving the privacy of payments on cryptographic ledgers. We explain various conflicting requirements and strategic choices which arise when trying to conceal the identity of participants and the exact details of transactions in our context while simultaneously enabling fast final settlement of tokens with a reasonable level of liquidity. We show that in these systems, third-party observers see obfuscated settlement. We finish with a summary of explicit warnings and advice for implementors of such systems.",

Whether general AI that exceeds human capabilities (AGI) will be the single greatest boon in history or a disaster is unknown. No proofs exist that AGI will benefit humans or that AGI will not harm or eliminate humans. Objective. I propose a set of logically distinct conceptual components that are necessary and sufficient to 1) ensure that most known AGI scenarios will not harm humanity and 2) robustly align AGI values and goals with human values. Methods. By systematically addressing each pathway category to malevolent AI we can induce the methods/axioms required to redress the category. Results and Discussion. Distributed ledger technology (DLT, blockchain) is integral to this proposal, e.g. to reduce the probability of hacking, provide an audit trail to detect and correct errors or identify components causing vulnerability or failure and replace them or shut them down remotely and/or automatically, and to separate and balance key AGI components via decentralized apps (dApps). Smart contracts based on DLT are necessary to address evolution of AI that will be too fast for human monitoring and intervention. The proposed axioms. 1) Access to technology by market license. 2) Transparent ethics embodied in DLT. 3) Morality encrypted via DLT. 4) Behavior control structure with values (ethics) at roots. 5) Individual bar-code identification of all critical components. 6) Configuration Item (from business continuity/disaster recovery planning). 7) Identity verification secured via DLT. 8) Smart automated contracts based on DLT. 9) Decentralized applications - AI software code modules encrypted via DLT. 10) Audit trail of component usage stored via DLT. 11) Social ostracism (denial of societal resources) augmented by DLT petitions.",

    "abstract": "In the age of Big Data, releasing protected sensitive data at a future point in time is critical for various applications. Such self-emerging data release requires the data to be protected until a prescribed data release time and be automatically released to the recipient at the release time, even if the data sender goes offline. While straight-forward centralized approaches provide a basic solution to the problem, unfortunately they are limited to a single point of trust and involve a single point of control. This paper presents decentralized techniques for supporting self-emerging data using smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain networks. We design a credible and enforceable smart contract for supporting self-emerging data release. The smart contract employs a set of Ethereum peers to jointly follow the proposed timed-release service protocol allowing the participating peers to earn the remuneration paid by the service users.We model the problem as an extensive-form game with imperfect information to protect against possible adversarial attacks including some peers destroying the private data (drop attack) or secretly releasing the private data before the release time (release-ahead attack). We demonstrate the efficacy and attack-resilience of the proposed techniques through rigorous analysis and experimental evaluation. Our implementation and experimental evaluation on the Ethereum official test network demonstrate the low monetary cost and the low time overhead associated with the proposed approach and validate its guaranteed security properties.",

This article presents the design and type-theoretic foundation of Nomos, a programming language for digital contracts that addresses these challenges. To express and enforce protocols, Nomos is based on shared binary session types. To control resource usage, Nomos employs automatic amortized resource analysis. To prevent the duplication or deletion of assets, Nomos uses a linear type system. A monad integrates the effectful session-typed language with a general-purpose functional language. Nomos' prototype implementation features linear-time type checking and efficient type reconstruction that includes automatic inference of resource bounds via off-the-shelf linear optimization. The effectiveness of the language is evaluated with case studies about implementing common smart contracts such as auctions, elections, and currencies. Nomos is completely formalized, including the type system, a cost semantics, and a transactional semantics to instantiate Nomos contracts on a blockchain. The type soundness proof ensures that protocols are followed at run-time and that types establish sound upper bounds on the resource consumption, ruling out re-entrancy and out-of-gas vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are programs running on top of blockchain platforms. They interact with each other through well-defined interfaces to perform financial transactions in a distributed system with no trusted third parties. But these interfaces also provide a favorable setting for attackers, who can exploit security vulnerabilities in smart contracts to achieve financial gain. This paper presents SmartScopy, a system for automatic synthesis of adversarial contracts that identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a victim smart contract. Our tool explores the space of \\emph{attack programs} based on the Application Binary Interface (ABI) specification of a victim smart contract in the Ethereum ecosystem. To make the synthesis tractable, we introduce \\emph{summary-based symbolic evaluation}, which significantly reduces the number of instructions that our synthesizer needs to evaluate symbolically, without compromising the precision of the vulnerability query. Building on the summary-based symbolic evaluation, SmartScopy further introduces a novel approach for partitioning the synthesis search space for parallel exploration, as well as a lightweight deduction technique that can prune infeasible candidates earlier. We encoded common vulnerabilities of smart contracts in our query language, and evaluated SmartScopy on the entire data set from etherscan with $>$25K smart contracts. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of summary-based symbolic evaluation and show that SmartScopy outperforms two state-of-the-art smart contracts analyzers, Oyente and Contractfuzz, in terms of running time, precision, and soundness. Furthermore, running on recent popular smart contracts, SmartScopy uncovers 20 vulnerable smart contracts that contain the recent BatchOverflow vulnerability and cannot be precisely detected by existing tools.",

    "abstract": "The problem of anonymous communications is to hide the fact that Alice is communicating with Bob at all, rather than the contents of her communications. More formally, the scenario in which Alice sends a message to Bob should be indistinguishable from the one in which Alice sends a message to Carol instead. While many cryptographic constructions (e.g., blind signatures, anonymous credentials and blockchains) assume anonymous channels as a starting point, there are significant drawbacks to all known protocols that aim to achieve them in the standard active adversary setting where the adversary can observe the network traffic on all links and, additionally, control a constant fraction of the parties. Onion routing is the most promising approach to anonymous channels. In onion routing, messages are sent via intermediaries and wrapped in layers of encryption, resulting in so-called \"onions\"; each intermediary's task is to \"peel off\" a layer of encryption and send the resulting onion to the next intermediary or to its final destination. In this paper, we initiate a rigorous theoretical study of onion routing. We consider the \"simple input-output setting\" where each participant desires to send a fixed-length message to a unique interlocutor and show that in this setting: - For an onion routing protocol to be anonymous and fault-tolerant, each party must transmit, on average, a polylogarithmic (in the security parameter) number of onions during an execution of the protocol. - There exists an onion routing protocol that is anonymous and fault-tolerant such that each party transmits only a polylogarithmic (in the security parameter) number of onions during an execution of the protocol.",

    "abstract": "The rise of smart contract systems such as Ethereum has resulted in a proliferation of blockchain-based decentralized applications including applications that store and manage a wide range of data. Current smart contracts are designed to be executed solely by miners and are revealed entirely on-chain, resulting in reduced scalability and privacy. In this paper, we discuss that scalability and privacy of smart contracts can be enhanced by splitting a given contract into an off-chain contract and an on-chain contract. Specifically, functions of the contract that involve high-cost computation or sensitive information can be split and included as the off-chain contract, that is signed and executed by only the interested participants. The proposed approach allows the participants to reach unanimous agreement off-chain when all of them are honest, allowing computing resources of miners to be saved and content of the off-chain contract to be hidden from the public. In case of a dispute caused by any dishonest participants, a signed copy of the off-chain contract can be revealed so that a verified instance can be created to make miners enforce the true execution result. Thus, honest participants have the ability to redress and penalize any fraudulent or dishonest behavior, which incentivizes all participants to honestly follow the agreed off-chain contract. We discuss techniques for splitting a contract into a pair of on/off-chain contracts and propose a mechanism to address the challenges of handling dishonest participants in the system. Our implementation and evaluation of the proposed approach using an example smart contract demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in Ethereum.",

In this study, we propose a novel highly secure distributed dynamic state estimation mechanism for wide-area (multi-area) smart grids, composed of geographically separated subregions, each supervised by a local control center. We firstly propose a distributed state estimator assuming regular system operation, that achieves near-optimal performance based on the local Kalman filters and with the exchange of necessary information between local centers. To enhance the security, we further propose to (i) protect the network database and the network communication channels against attacks and data manipulations via a blockchain (BC)-based system design, where the BC operates on the peer-to-peer network of local centers, (ii) locally detect the measurement anomalies in real-time to eliminate their effects on the state estimation process, and (iii) detect misbehaving (hacked/faulty) local centers in real-time via a distributed trust management scheme over the network. We provide theoretical guarantees regarding the false alarm rates of the proposed detection schemes, where the false alarms can be easily controlled. Numerical studies illustrate that the proposed mechanism offers reliable state estimation under regular system operation, timely and accurate detection of anomalies, and good state recovery performance in case of anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Our aim in this paper is to investigate the profitability of double-spending (DS) attacks that manipulate an a priori mined transaction in a blockchain. It was well understood that a successful DS attack is established when the proportion of computing power an attacker possesses is higher than that the honest network does. What is not yet well understood is how threatening a DS attack with less than 50% computing power used can be. Namely, DS attacks at any proportion can be of a threat as long as the chance to making a good profit exists. Profit is obtained when the revenue from making a successful DS attack is greater than the cost of carrying out one. We have developed a novel probability theory for calculating a finite time attack probability. This can be used to size up attack resources needed to obtain the profit. The results enable us to derive a sufficient and necessary condition on the value of a transaction targeted by a DS attack. Our result is quite surprising: we theoretically show that DS attacks at any proportion of computing power can be made profitable. Given one's transaction size, the results can also be used to assess the risk of a DS attack. An example of the attack resources is provided for the BitcoinCash network.",

In the proposed scheme, Ethereum smart contracts are created to define the interactions between data owner, data user, and multiple attribute authorities. A data user presents its attributes to different attribute authorities, and after successful validation of attributes, obtains attribute tokens from respective attribute authorities. After collecting enough attribute tokens, a smart contract will be executed to issue secret key to the data user to access the requested object.

Typically, fundamental design decisions involved in big data systems design include choosing appropriate storage and computing infrastructures. In this age of heterogeneous systems that integrate different technologies for optimized solution to a specific real world problem, big data system are not an exception to any such rule. As far as the storage aspect of any big data system is concerned, the primary facet in this regard is a storage infrastructure and NoSQL seems to be the right technology that fulfills its requirements. However, every big data application has variable data characteristics and thus, the corresponding data fits into a different data model. This paper presents feature and use case analysis and comparison of the four main data models namely document oriented, key value, graph and wide column. Moreover, a feature analysis of 80 NoSQL solutions has been provided, elaborating on the criteria and points that a developer must consider while making a possible choice. Typically, big data storage needs to communicate with the execution engine and other processing and visualization technologies to create a comprehensive solution. This brings forth second facet of big data storage, big data file formats, into picture. The second half of the research paper compares the advantages, shortcomings and possible use cases of available big data file formats for Hadoop, which is the foundation for most big data computing technologies. Decentralized storage and blockchain are seen as the next generation of big data storage and its challenges and future prospects have also been discussed.",

    "abstract": "Stellar is one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization. It adopts a variant of Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), named federated Byzantine agreement (FBA), which generalizes the traditional BFT algorithm to make it more suitable for open-membership blockchains. To this end, FBA introduces a quorum slice concept, which consists of a set of nodes. In FBA, a node can complete one consensus round when it receives specific messages from nodes in a quorum slice appointed by the node. In this study, we analyze FBA, whose security is highly dependent on the structure of quorum slices, and demonstrate that it is not superior to the traditional BFT algorithm in terms of safety and liveness. Then, to analyze the security of the Stellar consensus protocol (SCP), which is a construction for FBA, we investigate the current quorum slices in Stellar. We analyze the structure of quorum slices and measure the influence of each node quantitatively using two metrics, PageRank (PR) and the newly proposed NodeRank (NR). The results show that the Stellar system is significantly centralized. Thereafter, to determine how the centralized structure can have a negative impact on the Stellar system, we study the cascading failure caused by deleting only a few nodes (i.e., validators) in Stellar. We show that all of the nodes in Stellar cannot run SCP if only two nodes fail. To make matters worse, these two nodes are run and controlled by a single organization, the Stellar foundation.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are programs running on a blockchain. They are immutable to change, and hence can not be patched for bugs once deployed. Thus it is critical to ensure they are bug-free and well-designed before deployment. A Contract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The detection of contract defects is a method to avoid potential bugs and improve the design of existing code. Since smart contracts contain numerous distinctive features, such as the gas system. decentralized, it is important to find smart contract specified defects. To fill this gap, we collected smart-contract-related posts from Ethereum StackExchange, as well as real-world smart contracts. We manually analyzed these posts and contracts; using them to define 20 kinds of contract defects. We categorized them into indicating potential security, availability, performance, maintainability and reusability problems. To validate if practitioners consider these contract as harmful, we created an online survey and received 138 responses from 32 different countries. Feedback showed these contract defects are harmful and removing them would improve the quality and robustness of smart contracts. We manually identified our defined contract defects in 587 real world smart contract and publicly released our dataset. Finally, we summarized 5 impacts caused by contract defects. These help developers better understand the symptoms of the defects and removal priority.",

    "abstract": "We present Charlotte, a framework for composable, authenticated distributed data structures. Charlotte data is stored in blocks that reference each other by hash. Together, all Charlotte blocks form a directed acyclic graph, the blockweb; all observers and applications use subgraphs of the blockweb for their own data structures. Unlike prior systems, Charlotte data structures are composable: applications and data structures can operate fully independently when possible, and share blocks when desired. To support this composability, we define a language-independent format for Charlotte blocks and a network API for Charlotte servers. An authenticated distributed data structure guarantees that data is immutable and self-authenticating: data referenced will be unchanged when it is retrieved. Charlotte extends these guarantees by allowing applications to plug in their own mechanisms for ensuring availability and integrity of data structures. Unlike most traditional distributed systems, including distributed databases, blockchains, and distributed hash tables, Charlotte supports heterogeneous trust: different observers may have their own beliefs about who might fail, and how. Despite heterogeneity of trust, Charlotte presents each observer with a consistent, available view of data. We demonstrate the flexibility of Charlotte by implementing a variety of integrity mechanisms, including consensus and proof of work. We study the power of disentangling availability and integrity mechanisms by building a variety of applications. The results from these examples suggest that developers can use Charlotte to build flexible, fast, composable applications with strong guarantees.",

    "abstract": "We present Harvey, an industrial greybox fuzzer for smart contracts, which are programs managing accounts on a blockchain. Greybox fuzzing is a lightweight test-generation approach that effectively detects bugs and security vulnerabilities. However, greybox fuzzers randomly mutate program inputs to exercise new paths; this makes it challenging to cover code that is guarded by narrow checks, which are satisfied by no more than a few input values. Moreover, most real-world smart contracts transition through many different states during their lifetime, e.g., for every bid in an auction. To explore these states and thereby detect deep vulnerabilities, a greybox fuzzer would need to generate sequences of contract transactions, e.g., by creating bids from multiple users, while at the same time keeping the search space and test suite tractable. In this experience paper, we explain how Harvey alleviates both challenges with two key fuzzing techniques and distill the main lessons learned. First, Harvey extends standard greybox fuzzing with a method for predicting new inputs that are more likely to cover new paths or reveal vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Second, it fuzzes transaction sequences in a targeted and demand-driven way. We have evaluated our approach on 27 real-world contracts. Our experiments show that the underlying techniques significantly increase Harvey's effectiveness in achieving high coverage and detecting vulnerabilities, in most cases orders-of-magnitude faster; they also reveal new insights about contract code.",

    "abstract": "Although the emergence of the programmable smart contract makes blockchain systems easily embrace a wider range of industrial areas, how to execute smart contracts efficiently becomes a big challenge nowadays. Due to the existence of Byzantine nodes, the mechanism of executing smart contracts is quite different from that in database systems, so that existing successful concurrency control protocols in database systems cannot be employed directly. Moreover, even though smart contract execution follows a two-phase style, i.e, the miner node executes a batch of smart contracts in the first phase and the validators replay them in the second phase, existing parallel solutions only focus on the optimization in the first phase, but not including the second phase. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient concurrency control scheme which is the first one to do optimization in both phases. Specifically, (i) in the first phase, we give a variant of OCC (Optimistic Concurrency Control) protocol based on {\\em batching} feature to improve the concurrent execution efficiency for the miner and produce a schedule log with high parallelism for validators. Also, a graph partition algorithm is devised to divide the original schedule log into small pieces and further reduce the communication cost; and (ii) in the second phase, we give a deterministic OCC protocol to replay all smart contracts efficiently on multi-core validators where all cores can replay smart contracts independently. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-art solutions significantly.",

Compared with Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) that have been widely used in blockchain, the consensus mechanism designed on DAG structure (simply called as DAG consensus) can overcome some shortcomings such as high resource consumption, high transaction fee, low transaction throughput and long confirmation delay. However, the theoretic analysis on the DAG consensus is an untapped venue to be explored. To this end, based on one of the most typical DAG consensuses, Tangle, we investigate the impact of network load on the performance and security of the DAG-based ledger. Considering unsteady network load, we first propose a Markov chain model to capture the behavior of DAG consensus process under dynamic load conditions. The key performance metrics, i.e., cumulative weight and confirmation delay are analysed based on the proposed model. Then, we leverage a stochastic model to analyse the probability of a successful double-spending attack in different network load regimes. The results can provide an insightful understanding of DAG consensus process, e.g., how the network load affects the confirmation delay and the probability of a successful attack. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate the trade-off between security level and confirmation delay, which can act as a guidance for practical deployment of DAG-based ledgers.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of predicting whether the price of the 21 most popular cryptocurrencies (according to coinmarketcap.com) will go up or down on day d, using data up to day d-1. Our C2P2 algorithm is the first algorithm to consider the fact that the price of a cryptocurrency c might depend not only on historical prices, sentiments, global stock indices, but also on the prices and predicted prices of other cryptocurrencies. C2P2 therefore does not predict cryptocurrency prices one coin at a time --- rather it uses similarity metrics in conjunction with collective classification to compare multiple cryptocurrency features to jointly predict the cryptocurrency prices for all 21 coins considered. We show that our C2P2 algorithm beats out a recent competing 2017 paper by margins varying from 5.1-83% and another Bitcoin-specific prediction paper from 2018 by 16%. In both cases, C2P2 is the winner on all cryptocurrencies considered. Moreover, we experimentally show that the use of similarity metrics within our C2P2 algorithm leads to a direct improvement for 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies ranging from 0.4% to 17.8%. Without the similarity component, C2P2 still beats competitors on 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies considered. We show that all these results are statistically significant via a Student's t-test with p<1e-5. Check our demo at https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/dsail/demos/c2p2",

This has resulted in an increased demand for secure and private means of information computation. Towards this, the Yao's Millionaires' problem, i.e., to determine the richer among two millionaires' securely, finds an application. In this work, we present a new solution to the Yao's Millionaires' problem namely, Privacy Preserving Comparison (PPC). We show that PPC achieves this comparison in constant time as well as in one execution. PPC uses semi-honest third parties for the comparison who do not learn any information about the values. Further, we show that PPC is collusion-resistance. To demonstrate the significance of PPC, we present a secure, approximate single-minded combinatorial auction, which we call TPACAS, i.e., Truthful, Privacy-preserving Approximate Combinatorial Auction for Single-minded bidders. We show that TPACAS, unlike previous works, preserves the following privacies relevant to an auction: agent privacy, the identities of the losing bidders must not be revealed to any other agent except the auctioneer (AU), bid privacy, the bid values must be hidden from the other agents as well as the AU and bid-topology privacy, the items for which the agents are bidding must be hidden from the other agents as well as the AU. We demonstrate the practicality of TPACAS through simulations. Lastly, we also look at TPACAS' implementation over a publicly distributed ledger, such as the Ethereum blockchain.",

Fault-tolerant protocols are extensively used in the distributed database infrastructure of large enterprises such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, as well as permissioned blockchain systems like IBM's Hyperledger Fabric. However, and in spite of years of intensive research, existing fault-tolerant protocols do not adequately address all the characteristics of distributed system applications. In particular, hybrid cloud environments consisting of private and public clouds are widely used by enterprises. However, fault-tolerant protocols have not been adapted for such environments. In this paper, we introduce SeeMoRe, a hybrid State Machine Replication protocol to handle both crash and malicious failures in a public/private cloud environment. SeeMoRe considers a private cloud consisting of nonmalicious nodes (either correct or crash) and a public cloud with both Byzantine faulty and correct nodes. SeeMoRe has three different modes which can be used depending on the private cloud load and the communication latency between the public and the private cloud. We also introduce a dynamic mode switching technique to transition from one mode to another. Furthermore, we evaluate SeeMoRe using a series of benchmarks. The experiments reveal that SeeMoRe's performance is close to the state of the art crash fault-tolerant protocols while tolerating malicious failures.",

The recently revealed strikes of ransomware attacks have already resulted in significant economic losses and societal harm across different sectors, ranging from local governments to health care. Most modern ransomware use Bitcoin for payments. However, although Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded and publicly available, current approaches for detecting ransomware depend only on a couple of heuristics and/or tedious information gathering steps (e.g., running ransomware to collect ransomware related Bitcoin addresses). To our knowledge, none of the previous approaches have employed advanced data analytics techniques to automatically detect ransomware related transactions and malicious Bitcoin addresses. By capitalizing on the recent advances in topological data analysis, we propose an efficient and tractable data analytics framework to automatically detect new malicious addresses in a ransomware family, given only a limited records of previous transactions. Furthermore, our proposed techniques exhibit high utility to detect the emergence of new ransomware families, that is, ransomware with no previous records of transactions. Using the existing known ransomware data sets, we show that our proposed methodology provides significant improvements in precision and recall for ransomware transaction detection, compared to existing heuristic based approaches, and can be utilized to automate ransomware detection.",

These protocols provide a strong probabilistic safety guarantee in the presence of Byzantine adversaries while their concurrent and leaderless nature enables them to achieve high throughput and scalability. Unlike blockchains that rely on proof-of-work, they are quiescent and green. Unlike traditional consensus protocols where one or more nodes typically process linear bits in the number of total nodes per decision, no node processes more than logarithmic bits. It does not require accurate knowledge of all participants and exposes new possible tradeoffs and improvements in safety and liveness for building consensus protocols. The paper describes the Snow protocol family, analyzes its guarantees, and describes how it can be used to construct the core of an internet-scale electronic payment system called Avalanche, which is evaluated in a large scale deployment. Experiments demonstrate that the system can achieve high throughput (3400 tps), provide low confirmation latency (1.35 sec), and scale well compared to existing systems that deliver similar functionality. For our implementation and setup, the bottleneck of the system is in transaction verification.",

Access and operations in this band, aka Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), will be managed by a dynamic spectrum access system (SAS) to enable seamless spectrum sharing between secondary users (SUs) and incumbent users. Despite its benefits, SAS's design requirements, as set by FCC, present privacy risks to SUs, merely because SUs are required to share sensitive operational information (e.g., location, identity, spectrum usage) with SAS to be able to learn about spectrum availability in their vicinity. In this paper, we propose TrustSAS , a trustworthy framework for SAS that synergizes state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques with blockchain technology in an innovative way to address these privacy issues while complying with FCC's regulatory design requirements. We analyze the security of our framework and evaluate its performance through analysis, simulation and experimentation. We show that TrustSAS can offer high security guarantees with reasonable overhead, making it an ideal solution for addressing SUs' privacy issues in an operational SAS environment.",

    "abstract": "The consensus protocol named proof of work (PoW) is widely applied by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Although security of a PoW cryptocurrency is always the top priority, it is threatened by mining attacks like selfish mining. Researchers have proposed many mining attack models with one attacker, and optimized the attacker's strategy. During these mining attacks, an attacker pursues a higher relative revenue (RR) by wasting a large amount of computational power of the honest miners at the cost of a small amount of computational power of himself. In this paper, we propose a mining attack model with two phases: the original system and the multi-attacker system. It is the first model to provide both theoretical and quantitative analysis of mining attacks with two attackers. We explain how the original system turns into the multi-attacker system by introducing two attackers: the internal attacker and the external attacker. If both attackers take the attacking strategy selfish mining, the RR of the internal attacker in multi-attacker system will drop by up to 31.9% compared with his RR in original system. The external attacker will overestimate his RR by up to 44.6% in multiattacker system. Unexpected competitions, auctions between attackers and overestimation of attackers' influence factor are three main causes of both attackers' dropping RR. We propose a mining strategy named Partial Initiative Release (PIR) which is a semi-honest mining strategy in multi-attacker system. In some specific situations, PIR allows the attacker to get more block reward by launching an attack in multi-attacker system.",

While SGX protection does not specifically take into consideration such threats, we show in the current paper that a simple malware attack exploiting a separation between the build and signing processes can have a serious damaging impact, practically nullifying SGX integrity protection measures. We also explore two possible mitigations against the attack, one centralized leveraging SGX itself, and one distributed that relies on a smart contract deployed on a blockchain infrastructure.

It is an autonomous network where peers may submit models with improved accuracy and other peers may verify the accuracy improvement. The system maintains an append-only decentralized ledger to keep the log of critical information, including who has trained the model and improved its accuracy, when it has been improved, by how much it has improved, and where to find the newly updated model. DaiMoN rewards these contributing peers with cryptographic tokens. A main feature of DaiMoN is that it allows peers to verify the accuracy improvement of submitted models without knowing the test labels. This is an essential component in order to mitigate intentional model overfitting by model-improving peers. To enable this model accuracy evaluation with hidden test labels, DaiMoN uses a novel learnable Distance Embedding for Labels (DEL) function proposed in this paper. Specific to each test dataset, DEL scrambles the test label vector by embedding it in a low-dimension space while approximately preserving the distance between the dataset's test label vector and a label vector inferred by the classifier. It therefore allows proof-of-improvement (PoI) by peers without providing them access to true test labels. We provide analysis and empirical evidence that under DEL, peers can accurately assess model accuracy. We also argue that it is hard to invert the embedding function and thus, DEL is resilient against attacks aiming to recover test labels in order to cheat.

However, the presence of Bitcoin's obvious shortcomings such as excessive electricity consumption, unsatisfying transaction throughput, and large validation time (latency) makes it clear that a new, more efficient system is needed. We propose a protocol in which a set of nodes maintains and updates a linear ordering of transactions that are being submitted by users. Virtually every cryptocurrency system has such a protocol at its core, and it is the efficiency of this protocol that determines the overall throughput and latency of the system. We develop our protocol on the grounds of the well-established field of Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT) systems. This allows us to formally reason about correctness, efficiency, and security in the strictest possible model, and thus convincingly prove the overall robustness of our solution. Our protocol improves upon the state-of-the-art HoneyBadgerBFT by Miller et al. by reducing the asymptotic latency while matching the optimal communication complexity. Furthermore, in contrast to the above, our protocol does not require a trusted dealer thanks to a novel implementation of a trustless ABFT Randomness Beacon.",

We infer a pivotal chain along the path of each epoch in the graph, and a total order of the graph could be calculated without a centralized authority. To scale up, we leveraged the graph streaming property; high transaction validation speed will be achieved even if the DAG is growing. To scale out, we designed the direct signal gossip protocol to help disseminate block updates in the network, such that messages can be passed in the network more efficiently.

Third, such a system may be vulnerable to intensive spam activities, where dishonest owners flood the system with fake advertisements. We propose a geo-marketplace that addresses all these concerns. We employ searchable encryption, digital commitments, and blockchain to protect the location privacy of owners while at the same time incorporating accountability and spam-resilience mechanisms. We implement a prototype with two alternative designs that obtain distinct trade-offs between trust assumptions and performance. Our experiments on real location data show that one can achieve the above design goals with practical performance and reasonable financial overhead.",

    "abstract": "The Bitcoin network has offered a new way of securely performing financial transactions over the insecure network. Nevertheless, this ability comes with the cost of storing a large (distributed) ledger, which has become unsuitable for personal devices of any kind. Although the simplified payment verification (SPV) clients can address this storage issue, a Bitcoin SPV client has to rely on other Bitcoin nodes to obtain its transaction history and the current approaches offer no privacy guarantees to the SPV clients. This work presents $T^3$, a trusted hardware-secured Bitcoin full client that supports efficient oblivious search/update for Bitcoin SPV clients without sacrificing the privacy of the clients. In this design, we leverage the trusted execution and attestation capabilities of a trusted execution environment (TEE) and the ability to hide access patterns of oblivious random access memory (ORAM) to protect SPV clients' requests from a potentially malicious server. The key novelty of $T^3$ lies in the optimizations introduced to conventional ORAM, tailored for expected SPV client usages. In particular, by making a natural assumption about the access patterns of SPV clients, we are able to propose a two-tree ORAM construction that overcomes the concurrency limitation associated with traditional ORAMs. We have implemented and tested our system using the current Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Output database. Our experiment shows that the system is feasible to be deployed in practice while providing strong privacy and security guarantees to Bitcoin SPV clients.",

    "abstract": "Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) powered by distributed ledger technologies enables more flexible and faster digital identification workflows, while at the same time limiting the control and influence of central authorities. However, a global identity solution must be able to handle myriad credential types from millions of issuing organizations. As metadata about types of digital credentials is readable by everyone on the public permissioned ledger with Hyperledger Indy, anyone could find relevant and trusted credential types for their use cases by looking at the records on the blockchain. To this date, no efficient full-text search mechanism exists that would allow users to search for credential types in a simple and efficient fashion tightly integrated into their applications. In this work, we propose a full-text search framework based on the publicly available metadata on the Hyperledger Indy ledger for retrieving matching credential types. The proposed solution is able to find credential types based on textual input from the user by using a full-text search engine and maintaining a local copy of the ledger. Thus, we do not need to rely on information about credentials coming from a very large candidate pool of third parties we would need to trust, such as the website of a company displaying its own identifier and a list of issued credentials. We have also proven the feasiblity of the concept by implementing and evaluating a prototype of the full-text credential metadata search service.",

    "abstract": "Throughput limitations of existing blockchain architectures are one of the most significant hurdles for their wide-spread adoption. Attempts to address this challenge include layer-2 solutions, such as Bitcoin's Lightning or Ethereum's Plasma network, that move work off the main chain. Another prominent technique is sharding, i.e., breaking the network into many interconnected networks. However, these scaling approaches significantly increase the complexity of the programming model by breaking ACID guarantees increasing the cost and time for application development. In this paper, we describe a novel approach where we split the work traditionally assigned to cryptocurrency miners into two different node roles. Specifically, the selection and ordering of transactions are performed independently from their execution. The focus of this paper is to formalize the split of consensus and computation, and prove that this approach increases throughput without compromising security. In contrast to most existing proposals, our approach achieves scaling via separation of concerns, i.e., better utilization of network resources, rather than sharding. This approach allows established programming paradigms for smart contracts (which generally assume transactional atomicity) to persist without introducing additional complexity. We present simulations on a proof-of-concept network of 32 globally distributed nodes. While the consensus algorithm was identical in all simulations (a 2-step-commit protocol with rotating block proposer), block computation was either included in a consensus nodes' regular operations (conventional architecture) or delegated to specialized execution nodes (separation of concerns). Separation of concerns enables our system to achieve a throughput increase by a factor of 56 compared to conventional architectures without loss of safety or decentralization.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain systems, such as Ethereum, use an approach called \"metering\" to assign a cost to smart contract execution, an approach which is designed to incentivise miners to operate the network and protect it against DoS attacks. In the past, the imperfections of Ethereum metering allowed several DoS attacks which were countered through modification of the metering mechanism. This paper presents a new DoS attack on Ethereum which systematically exploits its metering mechanism. We first replay and analyse several months of transactions, during which we discover a number of discrepancies in the metering model, such as significant inconsistencies in the pricing of the instructions. We further demonstrate that there is very little correlation between the execution cost and the utilised resources, such as CPU and memory. Based on these observations, we present a new type of DoS attack we call Resource Exhaustion Attack, which uses these imperfections to generate low-throughput contracts. To do this, we design a genetic algorithm that generates contracts with a throughput on average 200 times slower than typical contracts. We then show that all major Ethereum client implementations are vulnerable and, if running on commodity hardware, would be unable to stay in sync with the network when under attack. We argue that such an attack could be financially attractive not only for Ethereum competitors and speculators, but also for Ethereum miners. Finally, we discuss short-term and potential long-term fixes against such attacks. Our attack has been responsibly disclosed to the Ethereum Foundation and awarded a bug bounty reward of 5,000 USD.",

    "abstract": "Ethereum smart contracts have recently drawn a considerable amount of attention from the media, the financial industry and academia. With the increase in popularity, malicious users found new opportunities to profit by deceiving newcomers. Consequently, attackers started luring other attackers into contracts that seem to have exploitable flaws, but that actually contain a complex hidden trap that in the end benefits the contract creator. In the blockchain community, these contracts are known as honeypots. A recent study presented a tool called HONEYBADGER that uses symbolic execution to detect honeypots by analyzing contract bytecode. In this paper, we present a data science detection approach based foremost on the contract transaction behavior. We create a partition of all the possible cases of fund movements between the contract creator, the contract, the transaction sender and other participants. To this end, we add transaction aggregated features, such as the number of transactions and the corresponding mean value and other contract features, for example compilation information and source code length. We find that all aforementioned categories of features contain useful information for the detection of honeypots. Moreover, our approach allows us to detect new, previously undetected honeypots of already known techniques. We furthermore employ our method to test the detection of unknown honeypot techniques by sequentially removing one technique from the training set. We show that our method is capable of discovering the removed honeypot techniques. Finally, we discovered two new techniques that were previously not known.",

To address this, we present an empirical evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art automated analysis tools using two new datasets: i) a dataset of 69 annotated vulnerable smart contracts that can be used to evaluate the precision of analysis tools; and ii) a dataset with all the smart contracts in the Ethereum Blockchain that have Solidity source code available on Etherscan (a total of 47,518 contracts). The datasets are part of SmartBugs, a new extendable execution framework that we created to facilitate the integration and comparison between multiple analysis tools and the analysis of Ethereum smart contracts. We used SmartBugs to execute the 9 automated analysis tools on the two datasets. In total, we ran 428,337 analyses that took approximately 564 days and 3 hours, being the largest experimental setup to date both in the number of tools and in execution time. We found that only 42% of the vulnerabilities from our annotated dataset are detected by all the tools, with the tool Mythril having the higher accuracy (27%). When considering the largest dataset, we observed that 97% of contracts are tagged as vulnerable, thus suggesting a considerable number of false positives. Indeed, only a small number of vulnerabilities (and of only two categories) were detected simultaneously by four or more tools.",

    "abstract": "The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is the existing routing protocol for Internet of Things (IoT). RPL is a proactive,lightweight, Distance Vector protocol which offers security against various forms of routing attacks. Still, there are various attacks(as rank, version attacks and many more ) which is possible in this network due to problem of unauthenticated or unencrypted control frames, centralized root controller, compromised or unauthenticated devices and many more ways. There are various solutions present in the literature but every solution has its pros and cons. There is no appropriate system framework till now which completely solves these all issues. So, we present an ultimate approach to mitigate these RPL attacks more efficiently and effectively. We use IDS based system for internal attacks and a mini-firewall for removing the external attacks. In IDS based approach, we use intrusion detection system at multiple locations for analyzing the behaviour of nodes. The final decision whether the node is attacker or not depends on mainly three things as: trust between the neighbouring nodes, local decision by multiple sink nodes and global decision by root node. We also use some blockchain features in this framework for better internal security. We use some threshold values and rules in mini-firewall for removing external attacks. In this paper, we provide the proposed approach and theoretical analysis of this approach which provide better protection from these attacks than any other method.",

In addition to being more democratic and energy-efficient, compared to popular protocols such as Bitcoin, Algorand also touts a much high transaction throughput. This paper is the first attempt in the literature to study and address this problem. By carefully modeling the participation costs and rewards received within a strategic interaction scenario, we first empirically show that even a small number of nodes defecting to participate in the protocol tasks due to insufficiency of the available incentives can result in the Algorand network failing to compute and add new blocks of transactions. We further show that this effect can be formalized by means of a mathematical model of interaction in Algorand given its participation costs and the current (or planned) reward distribution/sharing approach envisioned by the Algorand Foundation. Specifically, on analyzing this game model we observed that mutual cooperation under the currently proposed reward sharing approach is not a Nash equilibrium. This is a significant result which could threaten the success of an otherwise robust distributed consensus mechanism. We propose a novel reward sharing approach for Algorand and formally show that it is incentive-compatible, i.e., it can guarantee cooperation within a group of selfish Algorand users. Extensive numerical and Algorand simulation results further confirm our analytical findings. Moreover, these results show that for a given distribution of stakes in the network, our reward sharing approach can guarantee cooperation with a significantly smaller reward per round.",

    "abstract": "As ethereum blockchain has become popular, the number of users and transactions has skyrocketed, causing an explosive increase of its data size. As a result, ordinary clients using PCs or smartphones cannot easily bootstrap as a full node, but rely on other full nodes such as the miners to run or verify transactions. This may affect the security of ethereum, so light bootstrapping techniques such as fast sync has been proposed to download only parts of full data, yet the space overhead is still too high. One of the biggest space overhead that cannot easily be reduced is caused by saving the state of all accounts in the block's state trie. Fortunately, we found that more than 90% of accounts are inactive and old transactions are hard to be manipulated. Based on these observations, this paper propose a novel optimization technique called ethanos that can reduce bootstrapping cost by sweeping inactive accounts periodically and by not downloading old transactions. If an inactive account becomes active, ethanos restore its state by running a restoration transaction. Also, ethanos gives incentives for archive nodes to maintain the old transactions for possible re-verification. We implemented ethanos by instrumenting the go-ethereum (geth) client and evaluated with the real 113 million transactions from 14 million accounts between 7M-th and 8M-th blocks in ethereum. Our experimental result shows that ethanos can reduce the size of the account state by half, which, if combined with removing old transactions, may reduce the storage size for bootstrapping to around 1GB. This would be reasonable enough for ordinary clients to bootstrap on their personal devices.",

    "abstract": "Payment channel networks like Bitcoin's Lightning network are an auspicious approach for realizing high transaction throughput and almost-instant confirmations in blockchain networks. However, the ability to successfully make payments in such networks relies on the willingness of participants to lock collateral in the network. In Lightning, the key financial incentive is to lock collateral are small fees for routing payments for other participants. While users can choose these fees, currently, they mainly stick to the default fees. By providing insights on beneficial choices for fees, we aim to incentivize users to lock more collateral and improve the effectiveness of the network. In this paper, we consider a node $\\mathbf{A}$ that given the network topology and the channel details selects where to establish channels and how much fee to charge such that its financial gain is maximized. We formalize the optimization problem and show that it is NP-hard. We design a greedy algorithm to approximate the optimal solution. In each step, our greedy algorithm selects a node which maximizes the total reward concerning the number of shortest paths passing through $\\mathbf{A}$ and channel fees. Our simulation study leverages real-world data set to quantify the impact of our gain optimization and indicates that our strategy is at least a factor two better than other strategies.",

However, writing a correct smart contract is notoriously difficult. Moreover, once a state-changing transaction is confirmed by the network, the result is immutable. For this reason, it is crucial to perform a thorough testing of a smart contract application before its deployment. This paper's focus is on the test coverage criteria for smart contracts, which are objective rules that measure test quality. We analyze the unique characteristics of the Ethereum smart contract program model as compared to the conventional program model. To capture essential control flow behaviors of smart contracts, we propose the notions of whole transaction basis path set and bounded transaction interaction. The former is a limited set of linearly independent inter-procedural paths from which the potentially infinite paths of Ethereum transactions can be constructed by linear combination, while the latter is the permutations of transactions within a certain bound. Based on these two notions, we define a family of path-based test coverage criteria. Algorithms are given to the generation of coverage requirements. A case study is conducted to compare the effectiveness of the proposed test coverage criteria with random testing and statement coverage testing.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of cross-organization attack-prone byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) systems, so-called Blockchains, providing asynchronous state machine replication (SMR) solutions is no longer a theoretical concern. This paper introduces ACE: a general framework for the software design of fault-tolerant SMR systems. We first propose a new leader-based-view (LBV) abstraction that encapsulates the core properties provided by each view in a partially synchronous consensus algorithm, designed according to the leader-based view-by-view paradigm (e.g., PBFT and Paxos). Then, we compose several LBV instances in a non-trivial way in order to boost asynchronous liveness of existing SMR solutions. ACE is model agnostic - it abstracts away any model assumptions that consensus protocols may have, e.g., the ratio and types of faulty parties. For example, when the LBV abstraction is instantiated with a partially synchronous consensus algorithm designed to tolerate crash failures, e.g., Paxos or Raft, ACE yields an asynchronous SMR for $n = 2f+1$ parties. However, if the LBV abstraction is instantiated with a byzantine protocol like PBFT or HotStuff, then ACE yields an asynchronous byzantine SMR for $n = 3f+1$ parties. To demonstrate the power of ACE, we implement it in C++, instantiate the LBV abstraction with a view implementation of HotStuff -- a state of the art partially synchronous byzantine agreement protocol -- and compare it with the base HotStuff implementation under different adversarial scenarios. Our evaluation shows that while ACE is outperformed by HotStuff in the optimistic, synchronous, failure-free case, ACE has absolute superiority during network asynchrony and attacks.",

Payment channels have been extended to the payment network, through which users can utilize existing channels as intermediary links to route coins to others. However, routing payments through multiple channels bears nontrivial overheads. It requires every intermediary channel to lock a portion of its available capacity until the payment is settled. This may lead to deadlock in a concurrent situation. The intermediary nodes in a payment path may also charge fees for routing a payment. The longer the routing path, the more serious the above problems. In this paper, we design and develop a novel off-chain system to shorten the routing path for the payment network. In particular, we propose the channel hub, which is an extension of the payment hub, to allows transferring coins directly from one payment channel to another within the same hub. That is, the channel hub can be viewed as a shortcut device for the underlying payment network. We design a new protocol named Boros to perform secure off-chain cross-channel transfers through the channel hub. We not only present the security definition of the Boros protocol formally but also prove its security using the UC-framework. To demonstrate the feasibility of the Boros protocol, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype running on the Ethereum.

It promises to transform the digital infrastructure which powers extensive evolutions and impacts a lot of areas. Vehicle parking is a major problem in major cities around the world in both developed and developing countries. The common problems are unavailability or shortage of parking spaces, no information about tariff and no mean of searching availability of parking space online. The struggle doesn't end even if an individual finds a spot, he is required to pay in cash. This traditional and manual process takes a lot of time and causes a lot of hassle. In this paper, we provide a novel solution to the parking problem using IoT and distributed ledger technology. This system is based on pervasive computing and provides auto check-in and check-out.

Users can pay for their parking tickets using their credit cards from their smartphone app. This decreases their hassle of carrying cash and coins for purchasing parking tickets. Smart Parking will optimize the parking mechanism, save time, reduce traffic and pollution, and provide an enhanced user experience.

First, to improve recall, we propose to search for similar vulnerabilities in an automated way by leveraging the abstract vulnerability signature (AVS). Second, to remove the false positives (FPs) due to AVS-based matching, we summarize the detection rules of existing tools and apply the refined rules by considering various defense mechanisms (DMs). By integrating AVS-based code matching and the refined detection rules (RDR), our approach achieves higher precision and recall. On the collected 76,354 contracts, we build a benchmark consisting of 1,219 vulnerabilities covering five different vulnerability types identified together by our tool (DOUBLADE) and other three scanners. Additionally, we conduct a comparison between DOUBLADE and the others, on an additional 17,770 contracts.

    "abstract": "Improving transaction throughput is an important challenge for Bitcoin. However, shortening the block generation interval or increasing the block size to improve throughput makes it sharing blocks within the network slower and increases the number of orphan blocks. Consequently, the security of the blockchain is sacrificed. To mitigate this, it is necessary to reduce the block propagation delay. Because of the contribution of new Bitcoin protocols and the improvements of the Internet, the block propagation delay in the Bitcoin network has been shortened in recent years. In this study, we identify impacts of compact block relay---an up-to-date Bitcoin protocol---and Internet improvement on the block propagation delay and fork rate in the Bitcoin network from 2015 to 2019. Existing measurement studies could not identify them but our simulation enables it. The experimental results reveal that compact block relay contributes to shortening the block propagation delay more than Internet improvements. The block propagation delay is reduced by 64.5% for the 50th percentile and 63.7% for the 90th percentile due to Internet improvements, and by 90.1% for the 50th percentile and by 87.6% for the 90th percentile due to compact block relay.",

    "abstract": "While various covert botnets were proposed in the past, they still lack complete anonymization for their servers/botmasters or suffer from slow communication between the botmaster and the bots. In this paper, we propose a new generation hybrid botnet that covertly and efficiently communicates over Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN), called LNBot. LN is a payment channel network operating on top of Bitcoin network for faster Bitcoin transactions with negligible fees. Exploiting various anonymity features of LN, we designed a scalable two-layer botnet which completely anonymize the identity of the botmaster. In the first layer, the botmaster sends commands anonymously to the C&C servers through LN transactions. Specifically, LNBot allows botmaster's commands to be sent in the form of surreptitious multihop LN payments, where the commands are encoded with ASCII or Huffman encoding to provide covert communications. In the second layer, C&C servers further relay those commands to the bots they control in their mini-botnets to launch any type of attacks to victim machines. We implemented a proof-of-concept on the actual LN and extensively analyzed the delay and cost performance of LNBot. Our analysis show that LNBot achieves better scalibility compared to the other similar blockchain botnets with negligible costs. Finally, we also provide and discuss a list of potential countermeasures to detect LNBot activities and minimize its impacts.",

The wide spread of disinformation and fake news can cause detrimental societal effects. Despite the recent progress in detecting disinformation and fake news, it is still non-trivial due to its complexity, diversity, multi-modality, and costs of fact-checking or annotation. The goal of this chapter is to pave the way for appreciating the challenges and advancements via: (1) introducing the types of information disorder on social media and examine their differences and connections; (2) describing important and emerging tasks to combat disinformation for characterization, detection and attribution; and (3) discussing a weak supervision approach to detect disinformation with limited labeled data. We then provide an overview of the chapters in this book that represent the recent advancements in three related parts: (1) user engagements in the dissemination of information disorder; (2) techniques on detecting and mitigating disinformation; and (3) trending issues such as ethics, blockchain, clickbaits, etc. We hope this book to be a convenient entry point for researchers, practitioners, and students to understand the problems and challenges, learn state-of-the-art solutions for their specific needs, and quickly identify new research problems in their domains.",

    "abstract": "Proof of Stake (PoS) is a burgeoning Sybil resistance mechanism that aims to have a digital asset (\"token\") serve as security collateral in crypto networks. However, PoS has so far eluded a comprehensive threat model that encompasses both Byzantine attacks from distributed systems and financial attacks that arise from the dual usage of the token as a means of payment and a Sybil resistance mechanism. In particular, the existence of derivatives markets makes malicious coordination among validators easier to execute than in Proof of Work systems. We demonstrate that it is also possible for on-chain lending smart contracts to cannibalize network security in PoS systems. When the yield provided by these contracts is more attractive than the inflation rate provided from staking, stakers will tend to remove their staked tokens and lend them out, thus reducing network security. In this paper, we provide a simple stochastic model that describes how rational validators with varying risk preferences react to changes in staking and lending returns. For a particular configuration of this model, we provide a formal proof of a phase transition between equilibria in which tokens are predominantly staked and those in which they are predominantly lent. We further validate this emergent adversarial behavior (e.g. reduced staked token supply) with agent-based simulations that sample transitions under more realistic conditions. Our results illustrate that rational, non-adversarial actors can dramatically reduce PoS network security if block rewards are not calibrated appropriately above the expected yields of on-chain lending.",

In this paper, we study the evolutionary behavior of Ethereum transactions from a temporal graph point of view. We first develop a data analytics platform to collect external transactions associated with users as well as internal transactions initiated by smart contracts. Three types of temporal graphs, user-to-user, contract-to-contract and user-contract graphs, are constructed according to trading relationship and are segmented with an appropriate time window. We observe a strong correlation between the size of user-to-user transaction graph and the average Ether price in a time window, while no evidence of such linkage is shown at the average degree, average edge weights and average triplet closure duration. The macroscopic and microscopic burstiness of Ethereum transactions is validated. We analyze the Gini indexes of the transaction graphs and the user wealth in which Ethereum is found to be very unfair since the very beginning, in a sense, \"the rich is already very rich\".",

    "abstract": "The growing size of modern datasets necessitates a massive computation into smaller computations and operate in a distributed manner for improving overall performance. However, the adversarial servers in the distributed computing system deliberately send erroneous data in order to affect the computation for their benefit. Computing Boolean functions is the key component of many applications of interest, e.g., the classification problem, verification functions in the blockchain and the design of cryptographic algorithm. In this paper, we consider the problem of computing the Boolean function in which the computation is carried out distributively across several workers with particular focus on security against Byzantine workers. We note that any Boolean function can be modeled as a multivariate polynomial which have high degree in general. Hence, the recent proposed Lagrange Coded Computing (LCC) can be used to simultaneously provide resiliency, security, and privacy. However, the security threshold (i.e., the maximum number of adversarial workers can be tolerated) provided by LCC can be extremely low if the degree of polynomial is high. Our goal is to design an efficient coding scheme which achieves the optimal security threshold with low decoding overhead. We propose three different schemes called coded Algebraic normal form (ANF), coded Disjunctive normal form (DNF) and coded polynomial threshold function (PTF). Instead of modeling the Boolean function as a general polynomial, the key idea of the proposed schemes is to model it as the concatenation of some low-degree polynomials and the threshold functions.",

Although there has been significant work in the field of cloud access control mechanisms, however, with the advent of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), on-chain access control management frameworks hardly exist. Existing access control management mechanisms are tightly coupled with the business logic, resulting in governance issues, non-coherent with existing Identity Management Solutions, low security, and compromised usability. We propose a novel framework to implement dynamic role-based access control for decentralized applications (dApps). The framework allows for managing access control on a dApp, which is completely decoupled from the business application and integrates seamlessly with any dApps. The smart contract architecture allows for the independent management of business logic and execution of access control policies. It also facilitates secure, low cost, and a high degree of flexibility of access control management. The proposed framework promotes decentralized governance of access control policies and efficient smart contract upgrades. We also provide quantitative and qualitative metrics for the efficacy and efficiency of the framework. Any Turing complete smart contract programming language is an excellent fit to implement the framework. We expect this framework to benefit enterprise and non-enterprise dApps and provide greater access control flexibility and effective integration with traditional and state of the art identity management solutions.",

    "abstract": "The long-standing byzantine agreement problem gets more attention in recent years due to the increasing demand for scalable geo-replicated Byzantine state machine replication (SMR) systems (e.g., Blockchains). To date, the key bottleneck of such systems is the communication cost of the byzantine agreement they employ as a building block, which motivates many researchers to search for low-communication byzantine agreement protocols. The conventional approach is to design deterministic protocols in the eventually synchronous communication model that are optimized to reduce the communication cost after the global stabilization time (GST). In this paper, we challenge the conventional approach and argue it is not the best fit for scalable SMR systems since it might induce an unbounded communication cost during asynchronous periods before GST, which we prove to be inherent. Instead, we forgo eventual synchrony and propose a different approach that hopes for the best (synchrony) but prepares for the worst (asynchrony). Accordingly, we design an optimistic protocol that first tries to reach an agreement via an efficient deterministic algorithm that relies on synchrony for termination, and then, only if an agreement was not reached due to asynchrony, the protocol uses a randomized asynchronous algorithm for fallback that guarantees termination with probability $1$. Although randomized asynchronous algorithms are considered to be costly, we design our solution to pay this cost only when an equivalent cost has already been paid while unsuccessfully trying the synchronous protocol. Moreover, we formally prove that our protocol achieves optimal communication complexity under all network conditions and failure scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The paper develops a logical understanding of processes for signature of legal contracts, motivated by applications to legal recognition of smart contracts on blockchain platforms. A number of axioms and rules of inference are developed that can be used to justify a \"meeting of the minds\" precondition for contract formation from the fact that certain content has been signed. In addition to an \"offer and acceptance\" process, the paper considers \"signature in counterparts\", a legal process that permits a contract between two or more parties to be brought into force by having the parties independently (possibly, remotely) sign different copies of the contract, rather than placing their signatures on a common copy at a physical meeting. It is argued that a satisfactory account of signature in counterparts benefits from a logic with syntactic self-reference. The axioms used are supported by a formal semantics, and a number of further properties of the logic are investigated. In particular, it is shown that the logic implies that when a contract has been signed, the parties do not just agree, but are in mutual agreement (a common-knowledge-like notion) about the terms of the contract.",

To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel test case generation approach, called ADF-GA (All-uses Data Flow criterion based test case generation using Genetic Algorithm), for Solidity based Ethereum smart contract programs. ADF-GA aims to efficiently generate a valid set of test cases via three stages. First, the corresponding program control flow graph is constructed from the source codes. Second, the generated control flow graph is analyzed to obtain the variable information in the Solidity programs, locate the require statements, and also get the definition-use pairs to be tested. Finally, a genetic algorithm is used to generate test cases, in which an improved fitness function is proposed to calculate the definition-use pairs coverage of each test case with program instrumentation. Experimental studies are performed on several representative Solidity programs. The results show that ADF-GA can effectively generate test cases, achieve better coverage, and reduce the number of iterations in genetic algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In emerging applications such as blockchains and collaborative data analytics, there are strong demands for data immutability, multi-version accesses, and tamper-evident controls. This leads to three new index structures for immutable data, namely Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT), Merkle Bucket Tree (MBT), and Pattern-Oriented-Split Tree (POS-Tree). Although these structures have been adopted in real applications, there is no systematic evaluation of their pros and cons in the literature. This makes it difficult for practitioners to choose the right index structure for their applications, as there is only a limited understanding of the characteristics of each index. To alleviate the above deficiency, we present a comprehensive analysis of the existing index structures for immutable data, evaluating both their asymptotic and empirical performance. Specifically, we show that MPT, MBT, and POS-Tree are all instances of a recently proposed framework, dubbed \\my{Structurally Invariant and Reusable Indexes (SIRI)}. We propose to evaluate the SIRI instances based on five essential metrics: their efficiency for four index operations (i.e., lookup, update, comparison, and merge), as well as their \\my{deduplication ratios} (i.e., the size of the index with deduplication over the size without deduplication). We establish the worst-case guarantees of each index in terms of these five metrics, and we experimentally evaluate all indexes in a large variety of settings. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we conclude that POS-Tree is a favorable choice for indexing immutable data.",

Credit networks are peer-to-peer trust-based networks that enable fast and inexpensive cross-currency transactions compared to traditional bank wire transfers, which has led to their increasing popularity and use. Although researchers have studied security of transactions and privacy of users of such networks, and have invested significant efforts into designing efficient routing algorithms for credit networks, comparatively little work has been done in the area of {replenishing} credit links of users in the network. Replenishing links at regular intervals in a credit network is important to keep users solvent, the network viable with enough liquidity, and to prevent transaction failures. This is achieved by a process called {rebalancing} that enables a poorly funded user to create incoming as well as outgoing credit links. We propose a system where a user with zero or no link weights can create incoming links with existing, trusted users in the network, in a procedure we call {balance transfer}, followed by creating outgoing links to existing or new users that would like to join the network, a process we call {bailout}. Both these processes together constitute our proposed rebalancing mechanism. Our techniques would also serve to make the network more competitive by offering users lower rates of interest, and enable users to earn routing fees-based revenue by participating in high throughput transaction paths.",

The standard solution for off-chain payments, state channels, are optimized for frequent transactions between two entities and impose prohibitive liquidity and capital requirements on payment senders for marketplace transactions. We propose PayPlace, a scalable off-chain protocol for payments between consumers and sellers. Using PayPlace, consumers establish a virtual unidirectional payment channel with an intermediary operator to pay for their transactions. Unlike state channels, however, the PayPlace operator can reference the custodial funds accrued off-chain in these channels to in-turn make tamper-proof off-chain payments to merchants, without locking up corresponding capital in channels with merchants. Our design ensures that new payments made to merchants are guaranteed to be safe once notarized and provably mitigates well-known drawbacks in previous constructions like the data availability attack and ensures that neither consumers nor merchants need to be online to ensure continued safety of their notarized funds. We show that the on-chain monetary and computational costs for PayPlace is O(1) in the number of payment transactions processed, and is near-constant in other parameters in most scenarios. PayPlace can hence scale the payment throughput for large-scale marketplaces at no marginal cost and is orders of magnitude cheaper than the state-of-art solution for non-pairwise off-chain payments, Zero Knowledge Rollups.",

    "abstract": "By allowing users to obscure their transactions via including \"mixins\" (chaff coins), ring signature schemes have been widely used to protect a sender's identity of a transaction in privacy-preserving blockchain systems, like Monero and Bytecoin. However, recent works point out that the existing ring signature scheme is vulnerable to the \"chain-reaction\" analysis (i.e., the spent coin in a given ring signature can be deduced through elimination). Especially, when the diversity of mixins is low, the spent coin will have a high risk to be detected. To overcome the weakness, the ring signature should be consisted of a set of mixins with high diversity and produce observations having \"similar\" distributions for any two coins. In this paper, we propose a notion, namely $\\epsilon$-coin-indistinguishability ($\\epsilon$-CI), to formally define the \"similar\" distribution guaranteed through a differential privacy scheme. Then, we formally define the CI-aware mixins selection problem with disjoint-superset constraint (CIA-MS-DS), which aims to find a mixin set that has maximal diversity and satisfies the constraints of $\\epsilon$-CI and the budget. In CIA-MS-DS, each ring signature is either disjoint with or the superset of its preceding ring signatures. We prove that CIA-MS-DS is NP-hard and thus intractable. To solve the CIA-MS-DS problem, we propose two approximation algorithms, namely the Progressive Algorithm and the Game Theoretic Algorithm, with theoretic guarantees. Through extensive experiments on both real data sets and synthetic data sets, we demonstrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of our approaches.",

    "abstract": "The last decade has experienced a vast interest in Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies with a specific focus on the applications of this technology. However, slow confirmation times of transactions and unforeseeable high fees hamper their wide adoption for micro-payments. The idea of establishing payment channel networks is one of the many proposed solutions to address this scalability issue where nodes, by utilizing smart contracting, establish payment channels between each other and perform off-chain transactions. However, due to the way these channels are created, both sides have a certain one-way capacity for making transactions. Consequently, if one sides exceeds this one-way capacity, the channel becomes useless in that particular direction, which causes failures of payments and eventually creates an imbalance in the overall network. To keep the payment channel network sustainable, in this paper, we aim to increase the overall success rate of payments by effectively exploiting the fact that end-users are usually connected to the network at multiple points (i.e., gateways) any of which can be used to initiate the payment. We propose an efficient method for selection of the gateway for a user by considering the gateway's inbound and outbound payment traffic ratio. We then augment this proposed method with split payment capability to further increase success rate especially for large transactions. The evaluation of the proposed method shows that compared to greedy and maxflow-based approaches, we can achieve much higher success rates, which are further improved with split payments.",

    "abstract": "To improve transaction rates, many cryptocurrencies have implemented so-called ''Layer-2'' transaction protocols, where payments are routed across networks of private payment channels. However, for a given transaction, not every network state provides a feasible route to perform the payment; in this case, the transaction must be put on the public ledger. The payment channel network thus multiplies the transaction rate of the overall system; the less frequently it fails, the higher the multiplier. We build on earlier work on credit networks and show that this network liquidity problem is connected to the combinatorics of graphical matroids. Earlier work could only analyze the (unnatural) scenario where transactions had discrete sizes. Superficially, it might seem like the continuous case would be harder to examine. However, removing this assumption lets us make progress in two important directions. First, we give a partial answer to the ``monotonicity conjecture'' that previous work left open. This conjecture asks that the network's performance not degrade as capacity on any edge increases. And second, we construct here a network state sampling procedure with much faster asymptotic performance than off-the-shelf Markov chains ($O(\\vert E\\vert \\beta(\\vert E\\vert))$, where $\\beta(x)$ is the complexity of solving a linear program on $x$ constraints.) We obtain our results by mapping the underlying graphs to convex bodies and then showing that the liquidity and sampling problems reduce to bounding and computing the volumes of these bodies. The transformation relies crucially on the combinatorial properties of the underlying graphic matroid, as do the proofs of monotonicity and fast sampling.",

Similar to blockchain technologies, DAG-based systems aim to build an immutable ledger and are faced with security concerns regarding the irreversibility of the ledger state. However, due to their more complex nature and recent popularity, the study of adversarial actions has received little attention so far. In this paper we are concerned with a particular type of attack on the IOTA cryptocurrency, more specifically a Parasite Chain attack that attempts to revert the history stored in the DAG structure, also called the Tangle. In order to improve the security of the Tangle, we present a detection mechanism for this type of attack. In this mechanism, we embrace the complexity of the DAG structure by sampling certain aspects of it, more particularly the distribution of the number of approvers. We initially describe models that predict the distribution that should be expected for a Tangle without any malicious actors. We then introduce metrics that compare this reference distribution with the measured distribution. Upon detection, measures can then be taken to render the attack unsuccessful. We show that due to a form of the Parasite Chain that is different from the main Tangle it is possible to detect certain types of malicious chains. We also show that although the attacker may change the structure of the Parasite Chain to avoid detection, this is done so at a significant cost since the attack is rendered less efficient.",

    "abstract": "Crowdworking platforms provide the opportunity for diverse workers to execute tasks for different requesters. The popularity of the \"gig\" economy has given rise to independent platforms that provide competing and complementary services. Workers as well as requesters with specific tasks may need to work for or avail from the services of multiple platforms resulting in the rise of multi-platform crowdworking systems. Recently, there has been increasing interest by governmental, legal and social institutions to enforce regulations, such as minimal and maximal work hours, on crowdworking platforms. Platforms within multi-platform crowdworking systems, therefore, need to collaborate to enforce cross-platform regulations. While collaborating to enforce global regulations requires the transparent sharing of information about tasks and their participants, the privacy of all participants needs to be preserved. In this paper, we propose an overall vision exploring the regulation, privacy, and architecture dimensions for the future of work multi-platform crowdworking environments. We then present SEPAR, a multi-platform crowdworking system that enforces a large sub-space of practical global regulations on a set of distributed independent platforms in a privacy-preserving manner. SEPAR, enforces privacy using lightweight and anonymous tokens, while transparency is achieved using fault-tolerant blockchains shared across multiple platforms. The privacy guarantees of SEPAR against covert adversaries are formalized and thoroughly demonstrated, while the experiments reveal the efficiency of SEPAR in terms of performance and scalability.",

    "abstract": "Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has been widely utilized to formalize system artifacts and facilitate their development throughout the entire lifecycle. During complex system development, MBSE models need to be frequently exchanged across stakeholders. Concerns about data security and tampering using traditional data exchange approaches obstruct the construction of a reliable marketplace for digital assets. The emerging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), represented by blockchain, provides a novel solution for this purpose owing to its unique advantages such as tamper-resistant and decentralization. In this paper, we integrate MBSE approaches with DLT aiming to create a decentralized marketplace to facilitate the exchange of digital engineering assets (DEAs). We first define DEAs from perspectives of digital engineering objects, development processes and system architectures. Based on this definition, the Graph-Object-Property-Point-Role-Relationship (GOPPRR) approach is used to formalize the DEAs. Then we propose a framework of a decentralized DEAs marketplace and specify the requirements, based on which we select a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structured DLT solution. As a proof-of-concept, a prototype of the proposed DEAs marketplace is developed and a case study is conducted to verify its feasibility. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed marketplace facilitates free DEAs exchange with a high level of security, efficiency and decentralization.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has been recently proposed as an emerging paradigm to build machine learning models using distributed training datasets that are locally stored and maintained on different devices in 5G networks while providing privacy preservation for participants. In FL, the central aggregator accumulates local updates uploaded by participants to update a global model. However, there are two critical security threats: poisoning and membership inference attacks. These attacks may be carried out by malicious or unreliable participants, resulting in the construction failure of global models or privacy leakage of FL models. Therefore, it is crucial for FL to develop security means of defense. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based secure FL framework to create smart contracts and prevent malicious or unreliable participants from involving in FL. In doing so, the central aggregator recognizes malicious and unreliable participants by automatically executing smart contracts to defend against poisoning attacks. Further, we use local differential privacy techniques to prevent membership inference attacks. Numerical results suggest that the proposed framework can effectively deter poisoning and membership inference attacks, thereby improving the security of FL in 5G networks.",

These issues include facilitating secure transactions between IoT devices and immutably recording data. Most DLT architectures were not designed with IoT in mind and consequentially do not satisfy the requirements of many IoT applications. However, the relatively new class of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based DLTs show great promise for IoT networks. These DLTs require the rate at which transactions are issued and disseminated to be explicitly managed in order to ensure fairness among users. We present a congestion control algorithm for these DLTs, which optimises dissemination rate and guarantees that all nodes receive the same information and have fair access even in a dishonest environment, subject to the computing limitations of nodes. Our algorithm takes inspiration from well-known areas of networking research, such as QoS, and TCP. However, an important distinction between the DLT setting and traditional networks is the unique nature of traffic in DLT networks and the fact that nodes cannot trust familiar feedback measurements, such as packet acknowledgements or congestion notifications. Our solution realises a decentralised congestion control algorithm for DLTs without the need for trust among nodes.",

    "abstract": "The Selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy a contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for developers. On the one hand, using Selfdestruct function enables developers to remove smart contracts (SC) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency situations happen, e.g. being attacked. On the other hand, this function can increase the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for attackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or exclude the Selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online survey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their feedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to the Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information, we propose a method to find the self-destruct contracts (also called predecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by computing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the predecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found six reasons that led to the death of the contracts; three of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token, Confusing Contract and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of contracts. We developed a tool named LifeScope to detect these problems. LifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting Unmatched ERC20 Token and Confusing Contract. In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope achieves 85.67% of F-measure and 0.9014 of AUC. According to the feedback of developers who exclude Selfdestruct functions, we propose suggestions to help developers use Selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.",

From commerce and farming to medical care and education, it is difficult to find any aspect of our lives that will not be affected by these emerging technologies. At the same time, artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, cognitive computing, blockchain, virtual reality and augmented reality, belong to the fields most likely to affect law and, in particular, administrative law. The book examines universally applicable patterns in administrative decisions and judicial rulings. First, similarities and divergence in behavior among the different cases are identified by analyzing parameters ranging from geographical location and administrative decisions to judicial reasoning and legal basis. As it turns out, in several of the cases presented, sources of general law, such as competition or labor law, are invoked as a legal basis, due to the lack of current specialized legislation. This book also investigates the role and significance of national and indeed supranational regulatory bodies for advanced algorithms and considers ENISA, an EU agency that focuses on network and information security, as an interesting candidate for a European regulator of advanced algorithms. Lastly, it discusses the involvement of representative institutions in algorithmic regulation.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are Turing-complete programs that are executed across a blockchain network. Unlike traditional programs, once deployed they cannot be modified. As smart contracts become more popular and carry more value, they become more of an interesting target for attackers. In recent years, smart contracts suffered major exploits, costing millions of dollars, due to programming errors. As a result, a variety of tools for detecting bugs has been proposed. However, majority of these tools often yield many false positives due to over-approximation or poor code coverage due to complex path constraints. Fuzzing or fuzz testing is a popular and effective software testing technique. However, traditional fuzzers tend to be more effective towards finding shallow bugs and less effective in finding bugs that lie deeper in the execution. In this work, we present CONFUZZIUS, a hybrid fuzzer that combines evolutionary fuzzing with constraint solving in order to execute more code and find more bugs in smart contracts. Evolutionary fuzzing is used to exercise shallow parts of a smart contract, while constraint solving is used to generate inputs which satisfy complex conditions that prevent the evolutionary fuzzing from exploring deeper paths. Moreover, we use data dependency analysis to efficiently generate sequences of transactions, that create specific contract states in which bugs may be hidden. We evaluate the effectiveness of our fuzzing strategy, by comparing CONFUZZIUS with state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools and fuzzers. Our evaluation shows that our hybrid fuzzing approach produces significantly better results than state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools and fuzzers.",

    "abstract": "Over the past twenty years, the number of devices connected to the Internet grew exponentially. Botnets benefited from this rise to increase their size and the magnitude of their attacks. However, they still have a weak point in their Command & Control (C&C) system, which is often based on centralized services or require a complex infrastructure to keep operating without being taken down by authorities. The recent spread of blockchain technologies may give botnets a powerful tool to make them very hard to disrupt. Recent research showed how it is possible to embed C&C messages in Bitcoin transactions, making them nearly impossible to block. Nevertheless, transactions have a cost and allow very limited amounts of data to be transmitted. Because of that, only messages from the botmaster to the bots are sent via Bitcoin, while bots are assumed to communicate through external channels. Furthermore, for the same reason, Bitcoin-based messages are sent in clear. In this paper we show how, using Bitcoin Testnet, it is possible to overcome these limitations and implement a cost-free, bidirectional, and encrypted C&C channel between the botmaster and the bots. We propose a communication protocol and analyze its viability in real life. Our results show that this approach would enable a botmaster to build a robust and hard-to-disrupt C&C system at virtually no cost, thus representing a realistic threat for which countermeasures should be devised.",

    "abstract": "Global digitalization has given birth to the explosion of digital services in approximately every sector of contemporary life. Applications of artificial intelligence, blockchain technologies, and internet of things are promising to accelerate digitalization further. As a consequence, the number of data centers, which provide the services of data processing, storage, and communication services, is also increasing rapidly. Because data centers are energy-intensive with significant and growing electricity demand, an energy model of data centers with temporal, spatial, and predictive analysis capability is critical for guiding industry and governmental authorities for making technology investment decisions. However, current models fail to provide consistent and high dimensional energy analysis for data centers due to severe data gaps. This can be further attributed to the lack of the modeling capabilities for energy analysis of data center components including IT equipment and data center cooling and power provisioning infrastructure in current energy models. In this research, a technology-based modeling framework, in hybrid with a data-driven approach, is proposed to address the knowledge gaps in current data center energy models. The research aims to provide policy makers and data center energy analysts with comprehensive understanding of data center energy use and efficiency opportunities and a better understanding of macro-level data center energy demand and energy saving potentials, in addition to the technological barriers for adopting energy efficiency measures.",

PoSWs have many applications including time-stamping, blockchain design, and universally verifiable CPU benchmarks. Mahmoody, Moran, and Vadhan (ITCS 2013) gave the first construction of a PoSW in the random oracle model though the construction relied on expensive depth-robust graphs. In a recent breakthrough, Cohen and Pietrzak (EUROCRYPT 2018) gave an efficient PoSW construction that does not require expensive depth-robust graphs. In the classical parallel random oracle model, it is straightforward to argue that any successful PoSW attacker must produce a long $\\mathcal{H}$-sequence and that any malicious party running in sequential time $T-1$ will fail to produce an $\\mathcal{H}$-sequence of length $T$ except with negligible probability. In this paper, we prove that any quantum attacker running in sequential time $T-1$ will fail to produce an $\\mathcal{H}$-sequence except with negligible probability -- even if the attacker submits a large batch of quantum queries in each round. The proof is substantially more challenging and highlights the power of Zhandry's recent compressed oracle technique (CRYPTO 2019). We further extend this result to establish post-quantum security of a non-interactive PoSW obtained by applying the Fiat-Shamir transform to Cohen and Pietrzak's efficient construction (EUROCRYPT 2018).",

Since the Ethereum ecosystem is fast-growing some results from previous publications might be out-of-date and there may be a practice gap between academia and industry. To address this we performed an online survey of smart contract developers on Github to validate our findings and we received 165 useful responses. Based on the survey feedback and literature review, we present the first empirical study on smart contract maintenance.

    "abstract": "This work presents a new distributed Byzantine tolerant federated learning algorithm, HoldOut SGD, for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization. HoldOut SGD uses the well known machine learning technique of holdout estimation, in a distributed fashion, in order to select parameter updates that are likely to lead to models with low loss values. This makes it more effective at discarding Byzantine workers inputs than existing methods that eliminate outliers in the parameter-space of the learned model. HoldOut SGD first randomly selects a set of workers that use their private data in order to propose gradient updates. Next, a voting committee of workers is randomly selected, and each voter uses its private data as holdout data, in order to select the best proposals via a voting scheme. We propose two possible mechanisms for the coordination of workers in the distributed computation of HoldOut SGD. The first uses a truthful central server and corresponds to the typical setting of current federated learning. The second is fully distributed and requires no central server, paving the way to fully decentralized federated learning. The fully distributed version implements HoldOut SGD via ideas from the blockchain domain, and specifically the Algorand committee selection and consensus processes. We provide formal guarantees for the HoldOut SGD process in terms of its convergence to the optimal model, and its level of resilience to the fraction of Byzantine workers. Empirical evaluation shows that HoldOut SGD is Byzantine-resilient and efficiently converges to an effectual model for deep-learning tasks, as long as the total number of participating workers is large and the fraction of Byzantine workers is less than half (<1/3 for the fully distributed variant).",

Instead, these protocols outsource their legitimacy to mechanisms beyond their internal structure, relying on traditional centralized institutions such as national ID issuers and KYC providers to verify the claims they hold. This reliance has been employed to safeguard applications from a vulnerability previously thought to be impossible to address in distributed systems: the Sybil attack problem, which describes the abuse of an online system by creating many illegitimate virtual personas. Inspired by the progress in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there has recently been a surge in networked protocols that make use of subjective inputs such as voting, vouching, and interpreting, to arrive at a decentralized and sybil-resistant consensus for identity.

The business logic of dApps is usually implemented within smart contracts developed through Solidity, a programming language for writing smart contracts on different blockchain platforms, including the popular Ethereum. In Ethereum, the smart contracts run on the machines of miners and the gas corresponds to the execution fee compensating such computing resources. However, the deployment and execution costs of a smart contract depend on the implementation choices done by developers. Unappropriated design choices could lead to higher gas consumption than necessary. In this paper, we (i) identify a set of 19 Solidity code smells affecting the deployment and transaction costs of a smart contract, and (ii) assess the relevance of such smells through a survey involving 34 participants. On top of these smells, we propose GasMet, a suite of metrics for statically evaluating the code quality of a smart contract from the gas consumption perspective. An experiment involving 2,186 smart contracts demonstrates that the proposed metrics have direct associations with deployment costs. The metrics in our suite can be used for more easily identifying source code segments that need optimizations.",

That is, in contrast to uniform removing of edges as in DropEdge, following the Girvan-Newman algorithm, we detect network periphery structures using information on edge betweenness and then remove edges according to their betweenness centrality. Our experimental results on semi-supervised node classification tasks demonstrate that the LFGCN coupled with P-DropEdge accelerates the training task, increases stability and further improves predictive accuracy of learned graph topology structure. Finally, in our case studies we bring the machinery of LFGCN and other deep networks tools to analysis of power grid networks - the area where the utility of GDL remains untapped.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-dense edge computing (UDEC) has great potential, especially in the 5G era, but it still faces challenges in its current solutions, such as the lack of: i) efficient utilization of multiple 5G resources (e.g., computation, communication, storage and service resources); ii) low overhead offloading decision making and resource allocation strategies; and iii) privacy and security protection schemes. Thus, we first propose an intelligent ultra-dense edge computing (I-UDEC) framework, which integrates blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into 5G ultra-dense edge computing networks. First, we show the architecture of the framework. Then, in order to achieve real-time and low overhead computation offloading decisions and resource allocation strategies, we design a novel two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (\\textit{2Ts-DRL}) approach, consisting of a fast-timescale and a slow-timescale learning process, respectively. The primary objective is to minimize the total offloading delay and network resource usage by jointly optimizing computation offloading, resource allocation and service caching placement. We also leverage federated learning (FL) to train the \\textit{2Ts-DRL} model in a distributed manner, aiming to protect the edge devices' data privacy. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of both the \\textit{2Ts-DRL} and FL in the I-UDEC framework and prove that our proposed algorithm can reduce task execution time up to 31.87%.",

For example, these data can be related to pollution and gas emissions, which can be used to check the compliance with national and international regulations. The current approach for IoT data trading relies on a centralized third-party entity to negotiate between data consumers and data providers, which is inefficient and insecure on a large scale. In comparison, a decentralized approach based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT) enables data trading while ensuring trust, security, and privacy. However, due to the lack of understanding of the communication efficiency between sellers and buyers, there is still a significant gap in benchmarking the data trading protocols in IoT environments. Motivated by this knowledge gap, we introduce a model for DLT-based IoT data trading over the Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) system, intended to support massive environmental sensing. We characterize the communication efficiency of three basic DLT-based IoT data trading protocols via NB-IoT connectivity in terms of latency and energy consumption. The model and analyses of these protocols provide a benchmark for IoT data trading applications.",

    "abstract": "Large commercial buildings are complex cyber-physical systems containing expensive and critical equipment that ensure the safety and comfort of their numerous occupants. Yet occupant and visitor access to spaces and equipment within these buildings are still managed through unsystematic, inefficient, and human-intensive processes. As a standard practice, long-term building occupants are given access privileges to rooms and equipment based on their organizational roles, while visitors have to be escorted by their hosts. This approach is conservative and inflexible. In this paper, we describe a methodology that can flexibly and securely manage building access privileges for long-term occupants and short-term visitors alike, taking into account the risk associated with accessing each space within the building. Our methodology relies on blockchain smart contracts to describe, grant, audit, and revoke fine-grained permissions for building occupants and visitors, in a decentralized fashion. The smart contracts are specified through a process that leverages the information compiled from Brick and BOT models of the building. We illustrate the proposed method through a typical application scenario in the context of a real office building and argue that it can greatly reduce the administration overhead, while, at the same time, providing fine-grained, auditable access control.",

    "abstract": "With upcoming blockchain infrastructures, world-spanning Byzantine consensus is getting practical and necessary. In geographically distributed systems, the pace at which consensus is achieved is limited by the heterogenous latencies of connections between replicas. If deployed on a wide-area network, consensus-based systems benefit from weighted replication, an approach that utilizes extra replicas and assigns higher voting power to well connected replicas. This enables more choice in quorum formation and replicas can leverage proportionally smaller quorums to advance, thus decreasing consensus latency. However, the system needs a solution to autonomously adjust to its environment if network conditions change or faults occur. We present Adaptive Wide-Area REplication (AWARE), a mechanism which improves the geographical scalability of consensus with nodes being widely spread across the world. Essentially, AWARE is an automated and dynamic voting weight tuning and leader positioning scheme, which supports the emergence of fast quorums in the system. It employs a reliable self-monitoring process and provides a prediction model seeking to minimize the system's consensus latency. In experiments using several AWS EC2 regions, AWARE dynamically optimizes consensus latency by self-reliantly finding a fast weight configuration yielding latency gains observed by clients located across the globe.",

    "abstract": "We present a system for running auditable and verifiable elections in untrusted environments. Votes are anonymous since the order of candidates on a ballot sheet is random. Tellers see only the position of the candidate. Voters can check their vote. An election is auditable using blockchain log. Threshold-encryption, which is used to implement the quorum, prevents a deadlock from occurring if a minority of candidates or observers tries to sabotage the election. Candidates and observers can indicate that the election was free and fair by exposing their keys, which are used by the system to decrypt each vote. Ballot sheets are encrypted by onion-routing, which has a layer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to decode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their keys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without compromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter, their vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees. This system is designed to scale from one instance to a distributed system that runs over an unlimited number of instances, which can be achieved using cloud instances or smartphones belonging to voters or tellers.",

In this article, we give an overview of the techniques implemented in Byzantine Model Checker (ByMC). ByMC implements several techniques for automatic verification of threshold-guarded distributed algorithms. These algorithms have the following features: (1) up to $t$ of processes may crash or behave Byzantine; (2) the correct processes count messages and make progress when they receive sufficiently many messages, e.g., at least $t+1$; (3) the number $n$ of processes in the system is a parameter, as well as $t$; (4) and the parameters are restricted by a resilience condition, e.g., $n > 3t$. Traditionally, these algorithms were implemented in distributed systems with up to ten participating processes. Nowadays, they are implemented in distributed systems that involve hundreds or thousands of processes. To make sure that these algorithms are still correct for that scale, it is imperative to verify them for all possible values of the parameters.",

    "abstract": "Protecting secrets is a key challenge in our contemporary information-based era. In common situations, however, revealing secrets appears unavoidable, for instance, when identifying oneself in a bank to retrieve money. In turn, this may have highly undesirable consequences in the unlikely, yet not unrealistic, case where the bank's security gets compromised. This naturally raises the question of whether disclosing secrets is fundamentally necessary for identifying oneself, or more generally for proving a statement to be correct. Developments in computer science provide an elegant solution via the concept of zero-knowledge proofs: a prover can convince a verifier of the validity of a certain statement without facilitating the elaboration of a proof at all. In this work, we report the experimental realisation of such a zero-knowledge protocol involving two separated verifier-prover pairs. Security is enforced via the physical principle of special relativity, and no computational assumption (such as the existence of one-way functions) is required. Our implementation exclusively relies on off-the-shelf equipment and works at both short (60 m) and long distances (400 m) in about one second. This demonstrates the practical potential of multi-prover zero-knowledge protocols, promising for identification tasks and blockchain-based applications such as cryptocurrencies or smart contracts.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in the cloud computing domain have resulted in huge strides toward simplifying the procurement of hardware and software for diverse needs. By moving enterprise workloads to managed cloud offerings (private, public, hybrid), customers are delegating mundane tasks and labor-intensive maintenance activities related to network connectivity, procurement of cloud resource, application deployment, software patches, and upgrades, etc., This often translates to benefits such as high availability and reduced cost. The popularity of container and micro-services-based deployment has made Kubernetes the de-facto standard to deliver applications. However, even with Kubernetes orchestration, cloud service providers frequently have operational scalability issues due to lack of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) automation and increased demand for human operators when managing a large number of software deployments across multiple data centers/availability zones. Kubernetes solves this in a novel way by creating and managing custom applications using Operators. Agile methodology advocates incremental CICD which are adopted by cloud providers. However, ironically, it is this same continuous delivery feature of application updates, Kubernetes cluster upgrades, etc., that is also a bane to cloud providers. In this paper, we will demonstrate the use of IBM open-source project Razee as a scalable continuous deployment framework to deploy open-source RStudio and Nginx Operators. We will discuss how IBM Watson SaaS application Operator, Blockchain applications, and Kubernetes resources updates, etc., can be deployed similarly and the use of Operators to perform application life cycle management. We assert that using Razee in conjunction with Operators on Kubernetes simplifies application life cycle management and increases scalability.",

    "abstract": "There has been recently a lot of progress in designing efficient partially synchronous BFT consensus protocols that are meant to serve as core consensus engines for Proof of Stake blockchain systems. While the state-of-the-art solutions attain virtually optimal performance under this theoretical model, there is still room for improvement, as several practical aspects of such systems are not captured by this model. Most notably, during regular execution, due to financial incentives in such systems, one expects an overwhelming fraction of nodes to honestly follow the protocol rules and only few of them to be faulty, most likely due to temporary network issues. Intuitively, the fact that almost all nodes behave honestly should result in stronger confidence in blocks finalized in such periods, however it is not the case under the classical model, where finality is binary. We propose Highway, a new consensus protocol that is safe and live in the classical partially synchronous BFT model, while at the same time offering practical improvements over existing solutions. Specifically, block finality in Highway is not binary but is expressed by fraction of nodes that would need to break the protocol rules in order for a block to be reverted. During periods of honest participation finality of blocks might reach well beyond 1/3 (as what would be the maximum for classical protocols), up to even 1 (complete certainty). Having finality defined this way, Highway offers flexibility with respect to the configuration of security thresholds among nodes running the protocol, allowing nodes with lower thresholds to reach finality faster than the ones requiring higher levels of confidence.",

Sophisticated applications, like cryptocurrencies, need distributed ledgers to function. Distributed ledgers, such as blockchains and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), employ consensus protocols to add data in the form of blocks. However, such protocols are designed for resourceful devices that are interconnected via the Internet. Moreover, existing distributed ledgers are not deployable to D2D ecosystems since their storage needs are continuously increasing. In this work, we introduce and analyse Mneme, a DAG-based distributed ledger that can be maintained solely by mobile devices. Mneme utilizes two novel consensus protocols: Proof-of-Context (PoC) and Proof-of-Equivalence (PoE). PoC employs users' context to add data on Mneme. PoE is executed periodically to summarize data and produce equivalent blocks that require less storage. We analyze Mneme's security and justify the ability of PoC and PoE to guarantee the characteristics of distributed ledgers: persistence and liveness. Furthermore, we analyze potential attacks from malicious users and prove that the probability of a successful attack is inversely proportional to the square of the number of mobile users who maintain Mneme.",

    "abstract": "The Ripple credit network has emerged as a payment backbone with key advantages for financial institutions and the remittance industry. Its path-based IOweYou (IOU) settlements across different (crypto)currencies conceptually distinguishes the Ripple blockchain from cryptocurrencies, and makes it highly suitable to an orthogonal yet vast set of applications in the remittance world for cross-border transactions and beyond. This work studies the structure and evolution of the Ripple network since its inception, and investigates its vulnerability to devilry attacks that affect the credit of linnet users' wallets. We find that about 13M USD are at risk in the current Ripple network due to inappropriate configuration of the rippling flag on credit links, facilitating undesired redistribution of credit across those links. Although the Ripple network has grown around a few highly connected hub (gateway) wallets that constitute the network's core and provide high liquidity to users, such a credit link distribution results in a user base of around 112,000 wallets that can be financially isolated by as few as 10 highly connected gateway wallets. Indeed, today about 4.9M USD cannot be withdrawn by their owners from the Ripple network due to PayRoutes, a gateway tagged as faulty by the Ripple community. Finally, we observe that stale exchange offers pose a real problem, and exchanges (market makers) have not always been vigilant about periodically updating their exchange offers according to current real-world exchange rates. For example, stale offers were used by 84 Ripple wallets to gain more than 4.5M USD from mid-July to mid-August 2017. Our findings should prompt the Ripple community to improve the health of the network by educating its users on increasing their connectivity, and by appropriately maintaining the credit limits, rippling flags, and exchange offers on their credit links.",

    "abstract": "Path-based transaction (PBT) networks, which settle payments from one user to another via a path of intermediaries, are a growing area of research. They overcome the scalability and privacy issues in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum by replacing expensive and slow on-chain blockchain operations with inexpensive and fast off-chain transfers. In the form of credit networks such as Ripple and Stellar, they also enable low-price real-time gross settlements across different currencies. For example, SilentWhsipers is a recently proposed fully distributed credit network relying on path-based transactions for secure and in particular private payments without a public ledger. At the core of a decentralized PBT network is a routing algorithm that discovers transaction paths between payer and payee. During the last year, a number of routing algorithms have been proposed. However, the existing ad hoc efforts lack either efficiency or privacy. In this work, we first identify several efficiency concerns in SilentWhsipers. Armed with this knowledge, we design and evaluate SpeedyMurmurs, a novel routing algorithm for decentralized PBT networks using efficient and flexible embedding-based path discovery and on-demand efficient stabilization to handle the dynamics of a PBT network. Our simulation study, based on real-world data from the currently deployed Ripple credit network, indicates that SpeedyMurmurs reduces the overhead of stabilization by up to two orders of magnitude and the overhead of routing a transaction by more than a factor of two. Furthermore, using SpeedyMurmurs maintains at least the same success ratio as decentralized landmark routing, while providing lower delays. Finally, SpeedyMurmurs achieves key privacy goals for routing in PBT networks.",

    "abstract": "Memory-hard functions (MHF) are functions whose evaluation cost is dominated by memory cost. MHFs are egalitarian, in the sense that evaluating them on dedicated hardware (like FPGAs or ASICs) is not much cheaper than on off-the-shelf hardware (like x86 CPUs). MHFs have interesting cryptographic applications, most notably to password hashing and securing blockchains. Alwen and Serbinenko [STOC'15] define the cumulative memory complexity (cmc) of a function as the sum (over all time-steps) of the amount of memory required to compute the function. They advocate that a good MHF must have high cmc. Unlike previous notions, cmc takes into account that dedicated hardware might exploit amortization and parallelism. Still, cmc has been critizised as insufficient, as it fails to capture possible time-memory trade-offs, as memory cost doesn't scale linearly, functions with the same cmc could still have very different actual hardware cost. In this work we address this problem, and introduce the notion of sustained-memory complexity, which requires that any algorithm evaluating the function must use a large amount of memory for many steps. We construct functions (in the parallel random oracle model) whose sustained-memory complexity is almost optimal: our function can be evaluated using $n$ steps and $O(n/\\log(n))$ memory, in each step making one query to the (fixed-input length) random oracle, while any algorithm that can make arbitrary many parallel queries to the random oracle, still needs $\\Omega(n/\\log(n))$ memory for $\\Omega(n)$ steps. Our main technical contribution is the construction is a family of DAGs on $n$ nodes with constant indegree with high \"sustained-space complexity\", meaning that any parallel black-pebbling strategy requires $\\Omega(n/\\log(n))$ pebbles for at least $\\Omega(n)$ steps.",

    "abstract": "Witnet is a decentralized oracle network (DON) that connects smart contracts to the outer world. Generally speaking, it allows any piece of software to retrieve the contents published at any web address at a certain point in time, with complete and verifiable proof of its integrity and without blindly trusting any third party. Witnet runs on a blockchain with a native protocol token (called Wit), which miners-called witnesses-earn by retrieving, attesting and delivering web contents for clients. On the other hand, clients spend Wit to pay witnesses for their Retrieve-Attest-Deliver (RAD) work. Witnesses also compete to mine blocks with considerable rewards, but Witnet mining power is proportional to their previous performance in terms of honesty and trustworthiness-this is, their reputation as witnesses. This creates a powerful incentive for witnesses to do their work honestly, protect their reputation and not to deceive the network. The Witnet protocol is designed to assign the RAD tasks to witnesses in a way that mitigates most attack vectors to the greatest extent. At the same time, it includes a novel 'sharding' feature that (1) guarantees the efficiency and scalability of the network, (2) keeps the price of RAD tasks within reasonable bounds and (3) gives clients the freedom to adjust certainty and price by letting them choose how many witnesses will work on their RAD tasks. When coupled with a Decentralized Storage Network (DSN), Witnet also gives us the possibility to build the Digital Knowledge Ark: a decentralized, immutable, censorship-resistant and eternal archive of humanity's most relevant digital data. A truth vault aimed to ensure that knowledge will remain democratic and verifiable forever and to prevent history from being written by the victors.",

    "abstract": "We initiate the study of quantum races, games where two or more quantum computers compete to solve a computational problem. While the problem of dueling algorithms has been studied for classical deterministic algorithms, the quantum case presents additional sources of uncertainty for the players. The foremost among these is that players do not know if they have solved the problem until they measure their quantum state. This question of `when to measure?' presents a very interesting strategic problem. We develop a game-theoretic model of a multiplayer quantum race, and find an approximate Nash equilibrium where all players play the same strategy. In the two-party case, we further show that this strategy is nearly optimal in terms of payoff among all symmetric Nash equilibria. A key role in our analysis of quantum races is played by a more tractable version of the game where there is no payout on a tie; for such races we completely characterize the Nash equilibria in the two-party case. One application of our results is to the stability of the Bitcoin protocol when mining is done by quantum computers. Bitcoin mining is a race to solve a computational search problem, with the winner gaining the right to create a new block. Our results inform the strategies that eventual quantum miners should use, and also indicate that the collision probability---the probability that two miners find a new block at the same time---would not be too high in the case of quantum miners. Such collisions are undesirable as they lead to forking of the Bitcoin blockchain.",

    "abstract": "Permissioned Blockchain has become quite popular with enterprises forming consortium since it prioritizes trust over privacy. One of the popular platforms for distributed ledger solution, Hyperledger Fabric, requires a transaction to be endorsed or approved by a group of special members known as endorsers before undergoing validation. To endorse a transaction, an endorser mentions its identity along with the signature so that it can be verified later. However, for certain transactions, difference in opinion may exist among endorsers. Disclosing the identity of an endorser may lead to conflict within the consortium. In such cases, an endorsement policy which not only allows an endorser to support a transaction discreetly, but at the same time takes into account the decision of the majority is preferred. Thus we propose an Anonymous Endorsement System which uses a threshold endorsement policy in order to address the issue. All these factors motivated us to design a new ring signature scheme, called Fabric' Constant-Sized Linkable Ring Signature (FCsLRS) with Transaction-Oriented linkability for hiding identity of the endorsers. We have implemented the signature scheme in Golang and analyzed its security and performance by varying the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) modulus size. Feasibility of implementation is supported by experimental analysis. Signature and tag generation time is quite fast and remains constant irrespective of change in message length or endorsement set size for a given RSA modulus value, assuming all the endorsers generates their signature in parallel. Lastly, we also discuss the integration of the scheme on v1.2 Hyperledger Fabric.",

    "abstract": "Many blockchain-based protocols, such as Bitcoin, implement a decentralized asset transfer (or exchange) system. As clearly stated in the original paper by Nakamoto, the crux of this problem lies in prohibiting any participant from engaging in double-spending. There seems to be a common belief that consensus is necessary for solving the double-spending problem. Indeed, whether it is for a permissionless or a permissioned environment, the typical solution uses consensus to build a totally ordered ledger of submitted transfers. In this paper we show that this common belief is false: consensus is not needed to implement of a decentralized asset transfer system. We do so by introducing AT2 (Asynchronous Trustworthy Transfers), a class of consensusless algorithms. To show formally that consensus is unnecessary for asset transfers, we consider this problem first in the shared-memory context. We introduce AT2$_{SM}$, a wait-free algorithm that asynchronously implements asset transfer in the read-write shared-memory model. In other words, we show that the consensus number of an asset-transfer object is one. In the message passing model with Byzantine faults, we introduce a generic asynchronous algorithm called AT2$_{MP}$ and discuss two instantiations of this solution. First, AT2$_{D}$ ensures deterministic guarantees and consequently targets a small scale deployment (tens to hundreds of nodes), typically for a permissioned environment. Second, AT2$_{P}$ provides probabilistic guarantees and scales well to a very large system size (tens of thousands of nodes), ensuring logarithmic latency and communication complexity. Instead of consensus, we construct AT2$_{D}$ and AT2$_{P}$ on top of a broadcast primitive with causal ordering guarantees offering deterministic and probabilistic properties, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Over the past five years, the rewards associated with mining Proof-of-Work blockchains have increased substantially. As a result, miners are heavily incentivized to design and utilize Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that can compute hashes far more efficiently than existing general purpose hardware. Currently, it is difficult for most users to purchase and operate ASICs due to pricing and availability constraints, resulting in a relatively small number of miners with respect to total user base for most popular cryptocurrencies. In this work, we aim to invert the problem of ASIC development by constructing a Proof-of-Work function for which an existing general purpose processor (GPP, such as an x86 IC) is already an optimized ASIC. In doing so, we will ensure that any would-be miner either already owns an ASIC for the Proof-of-Work system they wish to participate in or can attain one at a competitive price with relative ease. In order to achieve this, we present HashCore, a Proof-of-Work function composed of \"widgets\" generated pseudo-randomly at runtime that each execute a sequence of general purpose processor instructions designed to stress the computational resources of such a GPP. The widgets will be modeled after workloads that GPPs have been optimized for, for example, the SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark suite for x86 ICs, in a technique we refer to as inverted benchmarking. We provide a proof that HashCore is collision-resistant regardless of how the widgets are implemented. We observe that GPP designers/developers essentially create an ASIC for benchmarks such as SPEC CPU 2017. By modeling HashCore after such benchmarks, we create a Proof-of-Work function that can be run most efficiently on a GPP, resulting in a more accessible, competitive, and balanced mining market.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning systems rely on data for training, input and ongoing feedback and validation. Data in the field can come from varied sources, often anonymous or unknown to the ultimate users of the data. Whenever data is sourced and used, its consumers need assurance that the data accuracy is as described, that the data has been obtained legitimately, and they need to understand the terms under which the data is made available so that they can honour them. Similarly, suppliers of data require assurances that their data is being used legitimately by authorised parties, in accordance with their terms, and that usage is appropriately recompensed. Furthermore, both parties may want to agree on a specific set of quality of service (QoS) metrics, which can be used to negotiate service quality based on cost, and then receive affirmation that data is being supplied within those agreed QoS levels. Here we present a conceptual architecture which enables data sharing agreements to be encoded and computationally enforced, remuneration to be made when required, and a trusted audit trail to be produced for later analysis or reproduction of the environment. Our architecture uses blockchain-based distributed ledger technology, which can facilitate transactions in situations where parties do not have an established trust relationship or centralised command and control structures. We explore techniques to promote faith in the accuracy of the supplied data, and to let data users determine trade-offs between data quality and cost. Our system is exemplified through consideration of a case study using multiple data sources from different parties to monitor traffic levels in urban locations.",

As stated in the original paper by Nakamoto, at the heart of these systems lies the problem of preventing double-spending; this is usually solved by achieving consensus on the order of transfers among the participants. In this paper, we treat the asset transfer problem as a concurrent object and determine its consensus number, showing that consensus is, in fact, not necessary to prevent double-spending. We first consider the problem as defined by Nakamoto, where only a single process---the account owner---can withdraw from each account. Safety and liveness need to be ensured for correct account owners, whereas misbehaving account owners might be unable to perform transfers. We show that the consensus number of an asset transfer object is $1$. We then consider a more general $k$-shared asset transfer object where up to $k$ processes can atomically withdraw from the same account, and show that this object has consensus number $k$. We establish our results in the context of shared memory with benign faults, allowing us to properly understand the level of difficulty of the asset transfer problem. We also translate these results in the message passing setting with Byzantine players, a model that is more relevant in practice. In this model, we describe an asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant asset transfer implementation that is both simpler and more efficient than state-of-the-art consensus-based solutions. Our results are applicable to both the permissioned (private) and permissionless (public) setting, as normally their differentiation is hidden by the abstractions on top of which our algorithms are based.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Computers (QCs), once they mature, will be able to solve some problems faster than Classic Computers. This phenomenon is called \"quantum advantage\" (or a stronger term \"quantum supremacy\"). Quantum advantage will help us to speed up computations in many areas, from artificial intelligence to medicine. However, QC power can also be leveraged to break modern cryptographic algorithms, which pervade modern software: use cases range from encryption of Internet traffic, to encryption of disks, to signing blockchain ledgers. While the exact date when QCs will evolve to reach quantum advantage is unknown, the consensus is that this future is near. Thus, in order to maintain crypto agility of the software, one needs to start preparing for the era of quantum advantage proactively. In this paper, we recap the effect of quantum advantage on the existing and new software systems, as well as the data that we currently store. We also highlight similarities and differences between the security challenges brought by QCs and the challenges that software engineers faced twenty years ago while fixing widespread Y2K bug. Technically, the Y2K bug and the quantum advantage problems are different: the former was caused by timing-related problems, while the latter is caused by a cryptographic algorithm being non-quantum-resistant. However, conceptually, the problems are similar: we know what the root cause is, the fix (strategically) is straightforward, yet the implementation of the fix is challenging. To address the quantum advantage challenge, we create a seven-step roadmap, deemed 7E. It is inspired by the lessons-learnt from the Y2K era amalgamated with modern knowledge. The roadmap gives developers a structured way to start preparing for the quantum advantage era, helping them to start planning for the creation of new as well as the evolution of the existent software.",

On the management plane, we develop an efficient management system using consortium blockchain with voting consensus, so the network can simultaneously manage and support by hundreds or thousands of nodes with high throughput.

Further, we propose a scheme to transport IP packets using CCN as a tunnel for supporting progressive deployment. We deployed the prototype of MIN to the largest operators' network in Mainland China, Hongkong and Macao, and demonstrated that the network can register identifier under co-governing consensus algorithm, support VoD service very well.",

    "abstract": "Payment channel networks (PCNs) are viewed as one of the most promising scalability solutions for cryptocurrencies today. Roughly, PCNs are networks where each node represents a user and each directed, weighted edge represents funds escrowed on a blockchain; these funds can be transacted only between the endpoints of the edge. Users efficiently transmit funds from node A to B by relaying them over a path connecting A to B, as long as each edge in the path contains enough balance (escrowed funds) to support the transaction. Whenever a transaction succeeds, the edge weights are updated accordingly. However, in deployed PCNs, channel balances (i.e., edge weights) are not revealed to users for privacy reasons; users know only the initial weights at time 0. Hence, when routing transactions, users first guess a path, then check if it supports the transaction. This guess-and-check process dramatically reduces the success rate of transactions. At the other extreme, knowing full channel balances can give substantial improvements in success rate at the expense of privacy. In this work, we study whether a network can reveal noisy channel balances to trade off privacy for utility. We show fundamental limits on such a tradeoff, and propose noise mechanisms that achieve the fundamental limit for a general class of graph topologies. Our results suggest that in practice, PCNs should operate either in the low-privacy or low-utility regime; it is not possible to get large gains in utility by giving up a little privacy, or large gains in privacy by sacrificing a little utility.",

The goal in this paper is to solve the test oracle problem in a way that is general, scalable and accurate. To achieve this, we use supervised learning over test execution traces. We label a small fraction of the execution traces with their verdict of pass or fail. We use the labelled traces to train a neural network (NN) model to learn to distinguish runtime patterns for passing versus failing executions for a given program. Our approach for building this NN model involves the following steps, 1. Instrument the program to record execution traces as sequences of method invocations and global state, 2. Label a small fraction of the execution traces with their verdicts, 3. Designing a NN component that embeds information in execution traces to fixed length vectors, 4. Design a NN model that uses the trace information for classification, 5. Evaluate the inferred classification model on unseen execution traces from the program. We evaluate our approach using case studies from different application domains: 1. Module from Ethereum Blockchain, 2. Module from PyTorch deep learning framework, 3. Microsoft SEAL encryption library components, 4. Sed stream editor, 5. Value pointer library and 6. Nine network protocols from Linux packet identifier, L7-Filter. We found the classification models for all subject programs resulted in high precision, recall and specificity, over 95%, while only training with an average 9% of the total traces. Our experiments show that the proposed neural network model is highly effective as a test oracle and is able to learn runtime patterns to distinguish passing and failing test executions for systems and tests from different application domains.",

Now, more than ten years later, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a peer-to-peer financial paradigm which leverages blockchain-based smart contracts to ensure its integrity and security, contains over 702m USD of capital as of April 15th, 2020. As this ecosystem develops, it is at risk of the very sort of financial meltdown it is supposed to be preventing. In this paper we explore how design weaknesses and price fluctuations in DeFi protocols could lead to a DeFi crisis. We focus on DeFi lending protocols as they currently constitute most of the DeFi ecosystem with a 76% market share by capital as of April 15th, 2020. First, we demonstrate the feasibility of attacking Maker's governance design to take full control of the protocol, the largest DeFi protocol by market share, which would have allowed the theft of 0.5bn USD of collateral and the minting of an unlimited supply of DAI tokens. In doing so, we present a novel strategy utilizing so-called flash loans that would have in principle allowed the execution of the governance attack in just two transactions and without the need to lock any assets. Approximately two weeks after we disclosed the attack details, Maker modified the governance parameters mitigating the attack vectors. Second, we turn to a central component of financial risk in DeFi lending protocols. Inspired by stress-testing as performed by central banks, we develop a stress-testing framework for a stylized DeFi lending protocol, focusing our attention on the impact of a drying-up of liquidity on protocol solvency. Based on our parameters, we find that with sufficiently illiquidity a lending protocol with a total debt of 400m USD could become undercollateralized within 19 days.",

Fog is highly distributed and consists of a wide number of autonomous end devices, which contribute to the processing. However, the variety of devices offered across different users are not audited. Hence, the security of Fog devices is a major concern in the Fog computing environment. Furthermore, mitigating and preventing those security measures is a research issue. Therefore, to provide the necessary security for Fog devices, we need to understand what the security concerns are with regards to Fog. All aspects of Fog security, which have not been covered by other literature works needs to be identified and need to be aggregate all issues in Fog security. It needs to be noted that computation devices consist of many ordinary users, and are not managed by any central entity or managing body. Therefore, trust and privacy is also a key challenge to gain market adoption for Fog. To provide the required trust and privacy, we need to also focus on authentication, threats and access control mechanisms as well as techniques in Fog computing. In this paper, we perform a survey and propose a taxonomy, which presents an overview of existing security concerns in the context of the Fog computing paradigm. We discuss the Blockchain-based solutions towards a secure Fog computing environment and presented various research challenges and directions for future research.",

While the quality of antibody testing, the availability of vaccines, and the likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue to be researched, we address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacy-preserving certification for test results and vaccinations. Methods: We developed a prototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture that facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally identifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with no other personal information revealed. The architecture, designed for scalability, relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called 'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data platform 'Solid', and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our mobile phone app and decentralized server architecture enable the mixture of verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive digital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to scale linearly in the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is 'just another app' which takes only minutes to use. Conclusions: The app and decentralized server architecture offer a prototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable generically, and in effect 'waiting in the wings' for the biological issues, plus key ethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.",

    "abstract": "The roles of trust, security and privacy are somewhat interconnected, but different facets of next generation networks. The challenges in creating a trustworthy 6G are multidisciplinary spanning technology, regulation, techno-economics, politics and ethics. This white paper addresses their fundamental research challenges in three key areas. Trust: Under the current \"open internet\" regulation, the telco cloud can be used for trust services only equally for all users. 6G network must support embedded trust for increased level of information security in 6G. Trust modeling, trust policies and trust mechanisms need to be defined. 6G interlinks physical and digital worlds making safety dependent on information security. Therefore, we need trustworthy 6G. Security: In 6G era, the dependence of the economy and societies on IT and the networks will deepen. The role of IT and the networks in national security keeps rising - a continuation of what we see in 5G. The development towards cloud and edge native infrastructures is expected to continue in 6G networks, and we need holistic 6G network security architecture planning. Security automation opens new questions: machine learning can be used to make safer systems, but also more dangerous attacks. Physical layer security techniques can also represent efficient solutions for securing less investigated network segments as first line of defense. Privacy: There is currently no way to unambiguously determine when linked, deidentified datasets cross the threshold to become personally identifiable. Courts in different parts of the world are making decisions about whether privacy is being infringed, while companies are seeking new ways to exploit private data to create new business revenues. As solution alternatives, we may consider blockchain, distributed ledger technologies and differential privacy approaches.",

    "abstract": "Smart contract has been regarded as one of the most promising and appealing notions in blockchain technology. Its self-enforcing and event-driven features make some online activities possible without a trusted third party, especially those related to financial and business. However, problems such as high security risk and low processing rate prevent it from being widely applied. In order to facilitate the construction of secure smart contract, and to improve the execution performance, various schemes and tools are proposed. However, to our best knowledge, a comprehensive survey for these proposals is absent, hindering new researchers and developers from a quick start. This paper surveys the literature on constructing and executing smart contracts over the period 2008-2020. We review the literature in three categories: 1) design paradigms that give examples and patterns on contract construction; 2) design tools that facilitate the development of secure smart contracts by providing security analysis or other auxiliary helps; and 3) extensions and alternative systems that improve the privacy or efficiency of smart contract executions. We start by a brief introduction of essential backgrounds, and then investigate the contract construction schemes on the most prevalent and representative smart contract platforms, i.e., Bitcoin and Ethereum. We list and group them into the first two categories according to their utility. As for the last category, we review the existing contract execution mechanisms, and further divide the state-of-the-art solutions into three classes: private contracts with auxiliary tools, off-chain channels, and extensions on the core functionality. Finally, we summarize the future research directions towards secure and privacy-preserving smart contracts. As far as we know, our work is the first systematic survey on schemes of contract construction and execution.",

    "abstract": "Received wisdom portrays digital records as guaranteeing perpetuity; as the New York Times wrote a decade ago: \"the web means the end of forgetting\". The reality however is that digital records suffer similar risks of access loss as the analogue versions they replace. Often this risk is outsourced to specialised third parties. Common use cases include Personal Information Management (PIM): e.g. calendars, diaries, tasks, etc. Frequently these are outsourced at two removes - firstly by the individual to their employer (e.g. using a company system) and then by their employer to an external provider. So enters a new risk: organisational change; by the time the information is required the organisational chain that links user to data may be broken: the employer transitions to a different provider, the employee leaves the company, the IS provider pivots to new offerings. The advent of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) could help mitigate these risks; and has led to a re-evaluation of the relationship between data creation and ownership. Although DLT is an imprecise term, it typically involves data storage across organisationally separate entities in a cryptographically secure form; and therefore could present a partial solution to the risk. This project presents the first research that applies DLT to the field of PIM, furthering design science state of the art by a novel implementation of a calendar application on the Ethereum blockchain. It also extends current research in utilising DLT in digital preservation, namely by enacting a continuum approach within a DL that allows for transfer of ownership of digital objects as they transition from individual to collective relevance. Finally it provides guidelines for future use of DLT within digital preservation.",

    "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) lays a new paradigm for the concept of Industry 4.0 and paves an insight for new industrial era. Nowadays smart machines and smart factories use machine learning/deep learning based models for incurring intelligence. However, storing and communicating the data to the cloud and end device leads to issues in preserving privacy. In order to address this issue, federated learning (FL) technology is implemented in IIoT by the researchers nowadays to provide safe, accurate, robust and unbiased models. Integrating FL in IIoT ensures that no local sensitive data is exchanged, as the distribution of learning models over the edge devices has become more common with FL. Therefore, only the encrypted notifications and parameters are communicated to the central server. In this paper, we provide a thorough overview on integrating FL with IIoT in terms of privacy, resource and data management. The survey starts by articulating IIoT characteristics and fundamentals of distributive and FL. The motivation behind integrating IIoT and FL for achieving data privacy preservation and on-device learning are summarized. Then we discuss the potential of using machine learning, deep learning and blockchain techniques for FL in secure IIoT. Further we analyze and summarize the ways to handle the heterogeneous and huge data. Comprehensive background on data and resource management are then presented, followed by applications of IIoT with FL in healthcare and automobile industry. Finally, we shed light on challenges, some possible solutions and potential directions for future research.",
