    "abstract": "For physical-layer authentication, the authentication tags are often sent concurrently with messages without much bandwidth expansion. In this paper, we present a channel coding approach for physical-layer authentication. The generation of authentication tags can be formulated as an encoding process for an ensemble of codes, where the shared key between Alice and Bob is considered as the input and the message is used to specify a code from the ensemble of codes. Then, we show that the security of physical-layer authentication schemes can be analyzed through decoding and physical-layer authentication schemes can potentially achieve both information-theoretic and computational securities.",

Currently, widely-deployed fallback authentication methods (e.g., security questions, email resets, and SMS resets) suffer from documented security and usability flaws that threaten the security of accounts. These flaws motivate us to design and study Geographical Security Questions (GeoSQ), a system for fallback authentication. GeoSQ is an Android application that utilizes autobiographical location data for fallback authentication. We performed security and usability analyses of GeoSQ through an in-person two-session lab study (n=36,18 pairs). Our results indicate that GeoSQ exceeds the security of its counterparts, while its usability (specifically login time) has room for improvement.",

    "abstract": "Information-theoretically secure (ITS) authentication is needed in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). In this paper, we study security of an ITS authentication scheme proposed by Wegman & Carter, in the case of partially known authentication key. This scheme uses a new authentication key in each authentication attempt, to select a hash function from an Almost Strongly Universal$_2$ hash function family. The partial knowledge of the attacker is measured as the trace distance between the authentication key distribution and the uniform distribution; this is the usual measure in QKD. We provide direct proofs of security of the scheme, when using partially known key, first in the information-theoretic setting and then in terms of witness indistinguishability as used in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We find that if the authentication procedure has a failure probability $\\epsilon$ and the authentication key has an $\\epsilon'$ trace distance to the uniform, then under ITS, the adversary's success probability conditioned on an authentic message-tag pair is only bounded by $\\epsilon+|\\mT|\\epsilon'$, where $|\\mT|$ is the size of the set of tags. Furthermore, the trace distance between the authentication key distribution and the uniform increases to $|\\mT|\\epsilon'$ after having seen an authentic message-tag pair. Despite this, we are able to prove directly that the authenticated channel is indistinguishable from an (ideal) authentic channel (the desired functionality), except with probability less than $\\epsilon+\\epsilon'$. This proves that the scheme is ($\\epsilon+\\epsilon'$)-UC-secure, without using the composability theorem.",

    "abstract": "Key Assignment Schemes (KASs) have been extensively studied in the context of cryptographically-enforced access control, where derived keys are used to decrypt protected resources. In this paper, we explore the use of KASs in entity authentication protocols, where we use derived keys to encrypt challenges. This novel use of KASs permits the efficient authentication of an entity in accordance with an authentication policy by associating entities with security labels representing specific services. Cryptographic keys are associated with each security label and demonstrating knowledge of an appropriate key is used as the basis for authentication. Thus, by controlling the distribution of such keys, restrictions may be efficiently placed upon the circumstances under which an entity may be authenticated and the services to which they may gain access. In this work, we explore how both standardized protocols and novel constructions may be developed to authenticate entities as members of a group associated to a particular security label, whilst protecting the long-term secrets in the system. We also see that such constructions may allow for authentication whilst preserving anonymity, and that by including a trusted third party we can achieve the authentication of individual identities and authentication based on timestamps without the need for synchronized clocks.",

    "abstract": "User authentication is one of the most important part of information security. Computer security most commonly depends on passwords to authenticate human users. Password authentication systems will be either been usable but not secure, or secure but not usable. While there are different types of authentication systems available alphanumeric password is the most commonly used authentication mechanism. But this method has significant drawbacks. An alternative solution to the text based authentication is Graphical User Authentication based on the fact that humans tends to remember images better than text. Graphical password authentication systems provide passwords which are easy to be created and remembered by the user. However, the main issues of simple graphical password techniques are shoulder surfing attack and image gallery attack. Studies reveals that most of the graphical passwords are either secure but not usable or usable but not secure. In this paper, a new technique that uses cued click point graphical password method along with the one-time session key is proposed. The goal is to propose a new authentication mechanism using graphical password to achieve higher security and better usability levels. The result of the system testing is evaluated and it reveals that the proposed system ensures security and usability to a great extent.",

    "abstract": "In order to perform Quantum Cryptography procedures it is often essencial to ensure that the parties of the communication are authentic. Such task is accomplished by quantum authentication protocols which are distributed algorithms based on the intrinsic properties of Quantum Mechanics. The choice of an authentication protocol must consider that quantum states are very delicate and that the channel is subject to eavesdropping. However, even in face of the various existing definitions of quantum authentication protocols in the literature, little is known about them in this perspective, and this lack of knowledge may unfavor comparisons and wise choices. In the attempt to overcome this limitation, in the present work we aim at showing an approach to evaluate quantum authentication protocols based on the determination of their quantum communication complexity. Based on our investigation, no similar methods to analyze quantum authentication protocols were found in the literature. Pursuing this further, our approach has advantages that need to be highlighted: it characterizes a systematic procedure to evaluate quantum authentication protocols; its evaluation is intuitive, based only on the protocol execution; the resulting measure is a concise notation of what resources a quantum authentication protocol demands and how many communications are performed; it allows comparisons between protocols; it makes possible to analyze the communication effort when an eavesdropping occurs; and, lastly, it is likely to be applied in almost any quantum authentication protocol. To illustrate the proposed approach, we also bring results about its application in ten existing quantum authentication protocols (data origin authentication and identity authentication). Such evaluations increase the knowledge about the existing protocols, presenting its advantages, limitations and contrasts.",

    "abstract": "We give a new class of security definitions for authentication in the quantum setting. These definitions capture and strengthen existing definitions of security against quantum adversaries for both classical message authentication codes (MACs) and well as full quantum state authentication schemes. The main feature of our definitions is that they precisely characterize the effective behavior of any adversary when the authentication protocol accepts, including correlations with the key. Our definitions readily yield a host of desirable properties and interesting consequences; for example, our security definition for full quantum state authentication implies that the entire secret key can be re-used if the authentication protocol succeeds. Next, we present several protocols satisfying our security definitions. We show that the classical Wegman-Carter authentication scheme with 3-universal hashing is secure against superposition attacks, as well as adversaries with quantum side information. We then present conceptually simple constructions of full quantum state authentication. Finally, we prove a lifting theorem which shows that, as long as a protocol can securely authenticate the maximally entangled state, it can securely authenticate any state, even those that are entangled with the adversary. Thus, this shows that protocols satisfying a fairly weak form of authentication security automatically satisfy a stronger notion of security (in particular, the definition of Dupuis, et al (2012)).",

    "abstract": "Implicit authentication (IA) is gaining popularity over recent years due to its use of user behavior as the main input, relieving users from explicit actions such as remembering and entering passwords. However, such convenience comes at a cost of authentication accuracy and delay which we propose to improve in this paper. Authentication accuracy deteriorates as users' behaviors change as a result of mood, age, a change of routine, etc. Current authentication systems handle failed authentication attempts by locking the user out of her mobile device. It is unsuitable for IA whose accuracy deterioration induces high false reject rate, rendering the IA system unusable. Furthermore, existing IA systems leverage computationally expensive machine learning which can introduce large authentication delay. It is challenging to improve the authentication accuracy of these systems without sacrificing authentication delay. In this paper, we propose a multi-level privilege control (MPC) scheme that dynamically adjusts users' access privilege based on their behavior change. MPC increases the system's confidence on users' legitimacy even when their behaviors deviate from historical data, thus improving authentication accuracy. It is a lightweight feature added to the existing IA schemes that helps avoid frequent and expensive retraining of machine learning models, thus improving authentication delay. We demonstrate that MPC increases authentication accuracy by 18.63\\% and reduces authentication delay by 7.02 minutes on average, using a public dataset that contains comprehensive user behavior data.",

    "abstract": "Performance of the existing physical layer authentication schemes could be severely affected by the imperfect estimates and variations of the communication link attributes used. The commonly adopted static hypothesis testing for physical layer authentication faces significant challenges in time-varying communication channels due to the changing propagation and interference conditions, which are typically unknown at the design stage. To circumvent this impediment, we propose an adaptive physical layer authentication scheme based on machine-learning as an intelligent process to learn and utilize the complex and time-varying environment, and hence to improve the reliability and robustness of physical layer authentication. Explicitly, a physical layer attribute fusion model based on a kernel machine is designed for dealing with multiple attributes without requiring the knowledge of their statistical properties. By modeling the physical layer authentication as a linear system, the proposed technique directly reduces the authentication scope from a combined N-dimensional feature space to a single dimensional (scalar) space, hence leading to reduced authentication complexity. By formulating the learning (training) objective of the physical layer authentication as a convex problem, an adaptive algorithm based on kernel least-mean-square is then proposed as an intelligent process to learn and track the variations of multiple attributes, and therefore to enhance the authentication performance. Both the convergence and the authentication performance of the proposed intelligent authentication process are theoretically analyzed. Our simulations demonstrate that our solution significantly improves the authentication performance in time-varying environments.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the secret key authentication capacity region. Specifically, the focus is on a model where a source must transmit information over an adversary controlled channel where the adversary, prior to the source's transmission, decides whether or not to replace the destination's observation with an arbitrary one of their choosing (done in hopes of having the destination accept a false message). To combat the adversary, the source and destination share a secret key which they may use to guarantee authenticated communications. The secret key authentication capacity region here is then defined as the region of jointly achievable message rate, authentication rate, and key consumption rate (i.e., how many bits of secret key are needed). This is the second of a two part study, with the studies separated by how the authentication rate is measured. Here, the authentication rate is measured by the minimum of the maximum probability of false acceptance where the minimization is over all highly probable subsets of observations at the adversary. That is, consider the maximum probability of false authentication as a function of the adversary's observation, and the adversary's observation as a random variable. The authentication rate is then measured as the smallest number for which the probability that the maximum probability of false authentication is greater than said number is arbitrary small. This is termed typical authentication, since it only needs to consider adversarial observations which are typical with the transmission. Under this measure of authentication matching inner and outer bounds are determined.",

An authentication framework over a wiretap channel $(W_1,W_2)$ is proposed to achieve information-theoretic security with the same key. The proposed framework bridges the two research areas in physical (PHY) layer security: secure transmission and message authentication. Specifically, the sender Alice first transmits message $M$ to the receiver Bob over $(W_1,W_2)$ with an error correction code; then Alice employs a hash function (i.e., $\\varepsilon$-AWU$_2$ hash functions) to generate a message tag $S$ of message $M$ using key $K$, and encodes $S$ to a codeword $X^n$ by leveraging an existing strongly secure channel coding with exponentially small (in code length $n$) average probability of error; finally, Alice sends $X^n$ over $(W_1,W_2)$ to Bob who authenticates the received messages. We develop a theorem regarding the requirements/conditions for the authentication framework to be information-theoretic secure for authenticating a polynomial number of messages in terms of $n$. Based on this theorem, we propose an authentication protocol that can guarantee the security requirements, and prove its authentication rate can approach infinity when $n$ goes to infinity. Furthermore, we design and implement an efficient and feasible authentication protocol over binary symmetric wiretap channel (BSWC) by using \\emph{Linear Feedback Shifting Register} based (LFSR-based) hash functions and strong secure polar code. Through extensive experiments, it is demonstrated that the proposed protocol can achieve low time cost, high authentication rate, and low authentication error rate.",

For authentication SIP relies on HTTP Digest by default the client is authenticated to the SIP proxy server called one way authentication because in this approach we can authenticate client to server and the client cant do any authentication in server side. In this paper we propose a mutual authentication mechanism that is not based on HTTP Digest and then we implement our method in IMS and start to do authentication client to server is done in first step and server to client next.",

    "abstract": "Group communication implies a many-to-many communication and it goes beyond both one-to-one communication (i.e., unicast) and one-to-many communication (i.e., multicast). Unlike most user authentication protocols that authenticate a single user each time, we propose a new type of authentication, called group authentication, that authenticates all users in a group at once. The group authentication protocol is specially designed to support group communications. There is a group manager who is responsible to manage the group communication. During registration, each user of a group obtains an unique token from the group manager. Users present their tokens to determine whether they all belong to the same group or not. The group authentication protocol allows users to reuse their tokens without compromising the security of tokens. In addition, the group authentication can protect the identity of each user.",

    "abstract": "Implicit authentication consists of a server authenticating a user based on the user's usage profile, instead of/in addition to relying on something the user explicitly knows (passwords, private keys, etc.). While implicit authentication makes identity theft by third parties more difficult, it requires the server to learn and store the user's usage profile. Recently, the first privacy-preserving implicit authentication system was presented, in which the server does not learn the user's profile. It uses an ad hoc two-party computation protocol to compare the user's fresh sampled features against an encrypted stored user's profile. The protocol requires storing the usage profile and comparing against it using two different cryptosystems, one of them order-preserving; furthermore, features must be numerical. We present here a simpler protocol based on set intersection that has the advantages of: i) requiring only one cryptosystem; ii) not leaking the relative order of fresh feature samples; iii) being able to deal with any type of features (numerical or non-numerical).

In a mobile network environment, a lightweight and secure authentication protocol is one of the most significant factors to enhance the degree of service persistence. This work presents a secure and lightweight keying and authentication protocol suite termed TAP (Time-Assisted Authentication Protocol). TAP improves the security of protocols with the assistance of time-based encryption keys and scales down the authentication complexity by issuing a re-authentication ticket. While moving across the network, a mobile customer node sends a re-authentication ticket to establish new sessions with service-providing nodes. Consequently, this reduces the communication and computational complexity of the authentication process. In the keying protocol suite, a key distributor controls the key generation arguments and time factors, while other participants independently generate a keychain based on key generation arguments. We undertake a rigorous security analysis and prove the security strength of TAP using CSP and rank function analysis.",

We evaluate two approaches: one-time authentication and active authentication. In one-time authentication, we employ the information of all channels available during one session. For active authentication we take advantage of mobile user behavior across multiple sessions by updating a confidence value of the authentication score. Our experiments are conducted on the semi-uncontrolled UMDAA-02 database. This database comprises smartphone sensor signals acquired during natural human-mobile interaction. Our results show that different traits can be complementary and multimodal systems clearly increase the performance with accuracies ranging from 82.2% to 97.1% depending on the authentication scenario.",

    "abstract": "Authentication and encryption are traditionally treated as two separate processes in wireless networks, this paper integrates user authentication into the process of solving eavesdropping attacks. A compressed sensing (CS)-based framework is proposed which manipulates the measurement matrix of CS to safeguard secure computationally. The framework is also capable of continuous authentication and transmission error correction and is robust to data loss. In detail, this paper first proposes an algorithm to generate a 2D key which depends on the physical property of communication channels. The 2D key is further used to generate authentication information and signal structure as well as encrypt original data. Then an encrypted message which contains both data and authentication information is formed for anonymous transmission. The legal receiver can split authentication information and data, and performing a data loss-robust and transmission error-robust authentication and recovery strategy. The framework is evaluated quantitatively using Monte Carlo simulation with simulated sparse signal. The secure transmission performance and authentication performance as well as data loss robustness are investigated. This framework provides an integrated security solution that efficiently safeguards the confidential, privacy and robust communication in cyber-physical systems, especially in resource-limited and safety-critical wireless networks.",

Specifically, the focus is on a model where a source must transmit information over an adversary controlled channel where the adversary, prior to the source's transmission, decides whether or not to replace the destination's observation with an arbitrary one of their choosing (done in hopes of having the destination accept a false message). To combat the adversary, the source and destination share a secret key which they may use to guarantee authenticated communications. The secret key authentication capacity region here is then defined as the region of jointly achievable message rate, authentication rate, and key consumption rate (i.e., how many bits of secret key are needed). This is the first of a two part study, with the parts differing in how the authentication rate is measured. In this first study the authenticated rate is measured by the traditional metric of the maximum expected probability of false authentication. For this metric, we provide an inner bound which improves on those existing in the literature. This is achieved by adopting and merging different classical techniques in novel ways. Within these classical techniques, one technique derives authentication capability directly from the noisy communications channel, and the other technique derives its' authentication capability directly from obscuring the source.",

RBA monitors extra features during login and requests for an additional authentication step if the observed feature values deviate from the usual ones in the login history. In state-of-the-art RBA re-authentication deployments, users receive an email with a numerical code in its body, which must be entered on the online service. Although this procedure has a major impact on RBA's time exposure and usability, these aspects were not studied so far. We introduce two RBA re-authentication variants supplementing the de facto standard with a link-based and another code-based approach. Then, we present the results of a between-group study (N=592) to evaluate these three approaches. Our observations show with significant results that there is potential to speed up the RBA re-authentication process without reducing neither its security properties nor its security perception. The link-based re-authentication via \"magic links\", however, makes users significantly more anxious than the code-based approaches when perceived for the first time. Our evaluations underline the fact that RBA re-authentication is not a uniform procedure. We summarize our findings and provide recommendations.",

Hence, this paper proposes a novel authentication system for implicit, continuous authentication of the smartphone user based on behavioral characteristics, by leveraging the sensors already ubiquitously built into smartphones. We propose novel context-based authentication models to differentiate the legitimate smartphone owner versus other users. We systematically show how to achieve high authentication accuracy with different design alternatives in sensor and feature selection, machine learning techniques, context detection and multiple devices. Our system can achieve excellent authentication performance with 98.1% accuracy with negligible system overhead and less than 2.4% battery consumption.",

We propose a Scalable Authentication Infrastructure for Next-generation Trust (SAINT), which partitions the Internet into groups with common, local trust roots, and isolates the effects of a compromised trust root. SAINT requires groups with direct routing connections to cross-sign each other for authentication purposes, allowing diverse authentication policies while keeping all entities globally verifiable. SAINT makes trust root management a central part of the network architecture, enabling trust root updates within seconds and allowing users to make flexible trust decisions. SAINT operates without a significant performance penalty and can be deployed alongside existing infrastructures.",

The realization of this future demands strong authentication guarantees to ensure that these devices are not abused and that their users are not endangered. However, providing authentication for these systems is a challenging task due to the high heterogeneity of pervasive computing applications. This heterogeneity makes it unfeasible to propose a single authentication solution for all of the pervasive computing applications. In this paper, we review several pervasive application scenarios and promising authentication methods for each. To do this, we first identify the key characteristics of each pervasive application scenario. Then, we review the strengths and weaknesses of prominent authentication methods from the literature. Finally, we identify which authentication methods are well suited for each application scenario based on the identified characteristics. Our goal is to provide promising directions to be explored for authentication in each of these scenarios.",

Recently, deep learning-based authenticators have increasingly been proposed to classify devices using these fingerprints, as they achieve higher accuracies compared to traditional approaches. However, it has been shown in other domains that adding carefully crafted perturbations to legitimate inputs can fool such classifiers. This can undermine the security provided by the authenticator. Unlike adversarial attacks applied in other domains, an adversary has no control over the propagation environment. Therefore, to investigate the severity of this type of attack in wireless communications, we consider an unauthorized transmitter attempting to have its signals classified as authorized by a deep learning-based authenticator. We demonstrate a reinforcement learning-based attack where the impersonator--using only the authenticator's binary authentication decision--distorts its signals in order to penetrate the system. Extensive simulations and experiments on a software-defined radio testbed indicate that at appropriate channel conditions and bounded by a maximum distortion level, it is possible to fool the authenticator reliably at more than 90% success rate.",

    "abstract": "Authentication is one of the essential security services in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for ensuring secure data sessions. Sensor node authentication ensures the confidentiality and validity of data collected by the sensor node, whereas user authentication guarantees that only legitimate users can access the sensor data. In a mobile WSN, sensor and user nodes move across the network and exchange data with multiple nodes, thus experiencing the authentication process multiple times. The integration of WSNs with Internet of Things (IoT) brings forth a new kind of WSN architecture along with stricter security requirements; for instance, a sensor node or a user node may need to establish multiple concurrent secure data sessions. With concurrent data sessions, the frequency of the re-authentication process increases in proportion to the number of concurrent connections, which makes the security issue even more challenging. The currently available authentication protocols were designed for the autonomous WSN and do not account for the above requirements. In this paper, we present a novel, lightweight and efficient key exchange and authentication protocol suite called the Secure Mobile Sensor Network (SMSN) Authentication Protocol. In the SMSN a mobile node goes through an initial authentication procedure and receives a re-authentication ticket from the base station. Later a mobile node can use this re-authentication ticket when establishing multiple data exchange sessions and/or when moving across the network. This scheme reduces the communication and computational complexity of the authentication process. We proved the strength of our protocol with rigorous security analysis and simulated the SMSN and previously proposed schemes in an automated protocol verifier tool. Finally, we compared the computational complexity and communication cost against well-known authentication protocols.",

    "abstract": "In recent times, a necessity has been raised in order to distribute computing applications often across grids. These applications are dependent on the services like data transfer or data portal services as well as submission of jobs. Security is of utmost importance in grid computing applications as grid resources are heterogeneous, dynamic, and multidomain. Authentication remains as the significant security challenge in grid environment. In traditional authentication protocol a single server stores the sensitive user credentials, like username and password. When such a server is compromised, a large number of user passwords, will be exposed. Our proposed approach uses a dual authentication protocol in order to improve the authentication service in grid environment. The protocol utilizes the fundamental concepts of trigon and based on the parameters of the trigon the user authentication will be performed. In the proposed protocol, the password is interpreted and alienated into more than one unit and these units are stored in two different servers, namely, Authentication Server and Backend Server. Only when the combined authentication scheme from both the servers authenticates the user, the privilege of accessing the requested resources is obtained by the user. The main advantage of utilizing the dual authentication protocol in grid computing is that an adversary user cannot attain the access privilege by compromising a single consolidated server because of the fact that the split password is stored in different servers.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral authentication is an important aspect in the vehicle networks to provide services to only authenticated peripherals and a security to internal vehicle modules such as anti-lock braking system, power-train control module, engine control unit, transmission control unit, and tire pressure monitoring. In this paper a three-way handshake scheme is proposed for a vehicle to a keyfob authentication. A keyfob is a key with a secure hardware that communicates and authenticates the vehicle over the wireless channel. Conventionally, a vehicle to keyfob authentication is realized through a challenge-response verification protocol. An authentic coupling between the vehicle identity and the keyfob avoids any illegal access to the vehicle. However, these authentication messages can be relayed by an active adversary, thereby, can amplify the actual distance between an authentic vehicle and a keyfob. Eventually, an adversary can possibly gain access to the vehicle by relaying wireless signals and without any effort to generate or decode the secret credentials. Hence, the vehicle to keyfob authentication scheme must contain an additional attribute verification such as physical movement of a keyfob holder. Our solution is a two-party and three-way handshake scheme with proactive and reactive commitment verification. The proposed solution also uses a time interval verification such that both vehicle and keyfob would yield a similar locomotion pattern of a dynamic keyfob within a similar observational time interval. Hence, the solution is different from the distance bounding protocols that require multiple iterations for the round-trip delay measurement. The proposed scheme is shown to be adaptable with the existing commitment scheme such as Schnorr identification scheme and Pedersen commitment scheme.",

    "abstract": "Emerging technology demands reliable authentication mechanisms, particularly in interconnected systems. Current systems rely on a single moment of authentication, however continuous authentication systems assess a users identity utilizing a constant biometric analysis. Spy Hunter, a continuous authentication mechanism uses keystroke dynamics to validate users over blocks of data. This easily-incorporated periodic biometric authentication system validates genuine users and detects intruders quickly. Because it verifies users in the background, Spy Hunter is not constrained to a password box. Instead, it is flexible and can be layered with other mechanisms to provide high-level security. Where other continuous authentication techniques rely on scripted typing, Spy Hunter validates over free text in authentic environments. This is accomplished in two phases, one where the user is provided a prompt and another where the user is allowed free access to their computer. Additionally, Spy Hunter focuses on the timing of different keystrokes rather than the specific key being pressed. This allows for anonymous data to authenticate users and avoids holding personal data. Utilizing a couple K-fold cross-validation techniques, Spy Hunter is assessed based on how often the system falsely accepts an intruder, how often the system falsely rejects a genuine user, and the time it takes to validate a users identity. Spy Hunter maintains error rates below 6% and identifies users in minimal numbers of keystrokes. Continuous authentication provides higher level security than one-time verification processes and Spy Hunter expands on the possibilities for behavioral analysis based on keystroke dynamics.",

The disadvantages of traditional authentication systems include the risks of forgetfulness, loss, and theft. Biometric authentication is therefore rapidly replacing traditional authentication methods and is becoming an everyday part of life. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recently introduced as a biometric authentication system suitable for security checks. The proposed authentication system helps investigators studying ECG-based biometric authentication techniques to reshape input data by slicing based on the RR-interval, and defines the Overall Performance (OP), which is the combined performance metric of multiple authentication measures. We evaluated the performance of the proposed system using a confusion matrix and achieved up to 95% accuracy by compact data analysis. We also used the Amang ECG (amgecg) toolbox in MATLAB to investigate the upper-range control limit (UCL) based on the mean square error, which directly affects three authentication performance metrics: the accuracy, the number of accepted samples, and the OP. Using this approach, we found that the OP can be optimized by using a UCL of 0.0028, which indicates 61 accepted samples out of 70 and ensures that the proposed authentication system achieves an accuracy of 95%.",

    "abstract": "In this work, message authentication over noisy channels is studied. The model developed in this paper is the authentication theory counterpart of Wyner's wiretap channel model. Two types of opponent attacks, namely impersonation attacks and substitution attacks, are investigated for both single message and multiple message authentication scenarios. For each scenario, information theoretic lower and upper bounds on the opponent's success probability are derived. Remarkably, in both scenarios, lower and upper bounds are shown to match, and hence the fundamental limit of message authentication over noisy channels is fully characterized. The opponent's success probability is further shown to be smaller than that derived in the classic authentication model in which the channel is assumed to be noiseless. These results rely on a proposed novel authentication scheme in which key information is used to provide simultaneous protection again both types of attacks.",

However, due to the limitations in PKI based solutions, some PKI less authentications mechanisms are proposed. This paper aims to present an overview of different authentication methods used in or together with SIP. We start by highlighting the security issues in SIP in the context of VoIP communication.

In many cases, passwords provide a false sense of security. Creating passwords which are both secure (i.e., hard for attackers to guess) and easy for humans to remember is, at best, a paradoxical task because these two criteria are diametrically opposed. Fortunately, a far more secure and user-friendly alternative is available. Public-key cryptography provides a means of both identifying and authenticating users without the need for passwords. KeyAuth is a generic and universal implementation of public-key authentication aimed at supplanting password-based authentication and significantly improving the security of network accessible resources by enhancing the usability of frequently used authentication mechanisms. KeyAuth is an application-, language-, operating system-, and protocol-independent public-key authentication service.",

It disables existing RFID authentication protocols from being safely applied to a reallife scenario in which the backend server is actually vulnerable, compromised or even malicious itself. We propose an RFID authentication scheme against an unsecure backend server. It is based on hash chain, searching over encrypted data, and coprivacy, defending against the privacy revealing to the backend server. The proposed scheme is scalable, resistant to desynchronization attacks, and provides mutual authentication in only three frontend communication steps. Moreover, it is the first scheme meeting the special security and privacy requirement for a cloud-based RFID authentication scenario in which the backend server is untrustworthy to readers held by cloud clients.",

Typical approaches include either key-based authentication at the application layer or physical layer authentication (PLA), where a message is considered authentic if it appears to have gone through the legitimate channel. In both cases a source of randomness is needed, whereas for PLA the random nature of the communication channel is exploited. In this paper we compare the various approaches using in all cases the channel as a source of randomness. We consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with a finite number of antennas. Simple auto-regressive (AR) models for its evolution as well as the relation of the legitimate and attacker channel are considered. In this setting the attacker can either predict the key used for key-based authentication or forge the channel estimated at the legitimate receiver for PLA. The analysis includes both symmetric and asymmetric key-based authentication. We compare the schemes in terms of false alarm and missed detection probability and we outline best attack strategies.",

But attackers who have gained access to a logged-in smartphone have no incentive to re-authenticate, so this must be done in an automatic, non-bypassable way.

Even worse in dense neighborhood or when a clogging Denial of Service (DoS) attack is mounted. The OBU would fail to verify for all received (authentic or fictitious) beacons. This could significantly delay the verifications of authentic beacons or even affect the awareness of neighboring vehicle status. In this paper, we propose an efficient cooperative beacon verification scheme leveraging efficient symmetric key based authentication on top of pseudonymous authentication (based on traditional public key cryptography), providing efficient discovery of authentic beacons among a pool of received authentic and fictitious beacons, and can significantly decrease waiting times of beacons in queue before their validations. We show with simulation results that our scheme can guarantee low waiting times for received beacons even in high neighbor density situations and under DoS attacks, under which a traditional scheme would not be workable.",

    "abstract": "Implicit authentication (IA) transparently authenticates users by utilizing their behavioral data sampled from various sensors. Identifying the illegitimate user through constantly analyzing current users' behavior, IA adds another layer of protection to the smart device. Due to the diversity of human behavior, the existing research works tend to simultaneously utilize many different features to identify users, which is less efficient. Irrelevant features may increase system delay and reduce the authentication accuracy. However, dynamically choosing the best suitable features for each user (personal features) requires a massive calculation, especially in the real environment. In this paper, we proposed EchoIA to find personal features with a small amount of calculation by utilizing user feedback. In the authentication phase, our approach maintains the transparency, which is the major advantage of IA. In the past two years, we conducted a comprehensive experiment to evaluate EchoIA. We compared it with other state-of-the-art IA schemes in the aspect of authentication accuracy and efficiency. The experiment results show that EchoIA has better authentication accuracy (93\\%) and less energy consumption (23-hour battery lifetimes) than other IA schemes.",

    "abstract": "Mobile device authentication has been a highly active research topic for over 10 years, with a vast range of methods having been proposed and analyzed. In related areas such as secure channel protocols, remote authentication, or desktop user authentication, strong, systematic, and increasingly formal threat models have already been established and are used to qualitatively and quantitatively compare different methods. Unfortunately, the analysis of mobile device authentication is often based on weak adversary models, suggesting overly optimistic results on their respective security. In this article, we first introduce a new classification of adversaries to better analyze and compare mobile device authentication methods. We then apply this classification to a systematic literature survey. The survey shows that security is still an afterthought and that most proposed protocols lack a comprehensive security analysis. Our proposed classification of adversaries provides a strong uniform adversary model that can offer a comparable and transparent classification of security properties in mobile device authentication methods.",

RBA monitors additional features during login, and when observed feature values differ significantly from previously seen ones, users have to provide additional authentication factors such as a verification code. RBA has the potential to offer more usable authentication, but the usability and the security perceptions of RBA are not studied well. We present the results of a between-group lab study (n=65) to evaluate usability and security perceptions of two RBA variants, one 2FA variant, and password-only authentication. Our study shows with significant results that RBA is considered to be more usable than the studied 2FA variants, while it is perceived as more secure than password-only authentication in general and comparably secure to 2FA in a variety of application types. We also observed RBA usability problems and provide recommendations for mitigation. Our contribution provides a first deeper understanding of the users' perception of RBA and helps to improve RBA implementations for a broader user acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, user authentication is one of the important topics in information security. Strong textbased password schemes could provide with certain degree of security. However, the fact that strong passwords are difficult to memorize often leads their owners to write them down on papers or even save them in a computer file. Graphical authentication has been proposed as a possible alternative solution to textbased authentication, motivated particularly by the fact that humans can remember images better than text. In recent years, many networks, computer systems and Internet based environments try used graphical authentication technique for their users authentication. All of graphical passwords have two different aspects which are usability and security. Unfortunately none of these algorithms were being able to cover both of these aspects at the same time. In this paper, we described eight recognition based authentication algorithms in terms of their drawbacks and attacks. In the next section, the usability standards from ISO and the related attributes for graphical user authentication usability are discussed. The related attack patterns for graphical user authentication security part are also discussed. Finally, a comparison table of all recognition based algorithms is presented based on ISO and attack patterns standards.",

    "abstract": "Biometrics are widely used for authentication in consumer devices and business settings as they provide sufficiently strong security, instant verification and convenience for users. However, biometrics are hard to keep secret, stolen biometrics pose lifelong security risks to users as they cannot be reset and re-issued, and transactions authenticated by biometrics across different systems are linkable and traceable back to the individual identity. In addition, their cost-benefit analysis does not include personal implications to users, who are least prepared for the imminent negative outcomes, and are not often given equally convenient alternative authentication options. We introduce ai.lock, a secret image based authentication method for mobile devices which uses an imaging sensor to reliably extract authentication credentials similar to biometrics. Despite lacking the regularities of biometric image features, we show that ai.lock consistently extracts features across authentication attempts from general user captured images, to reconstruct credentials that can match and exceed the security of biometrics (EER = 0.71%). ai.lock only stores a hash of the object's image. We measure the security of ai.lock against brute force attacks on more than 3.5 billion authentication instances built from more than 250,000 images of real objects, and 100,000 synthetically generated images using a generative adversarial network trained on object images. We show that the ai.lock Shannon entropy is superior to a fingerprint based authentication built into popular mobile devices.",

    "abstract": "Creating a secure environment for communications is becoming a significantly challenging task in 5G Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) given the stringent latency and high capacity requirements of 5G networks. This is particularly factual knowing that the infrastructure tends to be highly diversified especially with the continuous deployment of small cells. In fact, frequent handovers in these cells introduce unnecessarily recurring authentications leading to increased latency. In this paper, we propose a software-defined wireless network (SDWN)-enabled fast cross-authentication scheme which combines non-cryptographic and cryptographic algorithms to address the challenges of latency and weak security. Initially, the received radio signal strength vectors at the mobile terminal (MT) is used as a fingerprinting source to generate an unpredictable secret key. Subsequently, a cryptographic mechanism based upon the authentication and key agreement protocol by employing the generated secret key is performed in order to improve the confidentiality and integrity of the authentication handover. Further, we propose a radio trusted zone database aiming to enhance the frequent authentication of radio devices which are present in the network. In order to reduce recurring authentications, a given covered area is divided into trusted zones where each zone contains more than one small cell, thus permitting the MT to initiate a single authentication request per zone, even if it keeps roaming between different cells. The proposed scheme is analyzed under different attack scenarios and its complexity is compared with cryptographic and non-cryptographic approaches to demonstrate its security resilience and computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In this emerging data-driven world, secure and ubiquitous authentication mechanisms are necessary prior to any confidential information delivery. Biometric authentication has been widely adopted as it provides a unique and non-transferable solution for user authentication. In this article, the authors envision the need for an in-field, remote and on-demand authentication system for a highly mobile and tactical environment, such as critical information delivery to soldiers in a battlefield. Fingerprint-based in-field biometric authentication combined with the conventional password-based techniques would ensure strong security of critical information delivery. The proposed in-field fingerprint authentication system involves: (i) wearable fingerprint sensor, (ii) template extraction (TE) algorithm, (iii) data encryption, (iv) on-body and long-range communications, all of which are subject to energy constraints due to the requirement of small form-factor wearable devices. This paper explores the design space and provides an optimized solution for resource allocation to enable energy-efficient in-field fingerprint-based authentication. Using Human Body Communication (HBC) for the on-body data transfer along with the analytics (TE algorithm) on the hub allows for the maximum lifetime of the energy-sparse sensor. A custom-built hardware prototype using COTS components demonstrates the feasibility of the in-field fingerprint authentication framework.",

    "abstract": "Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) can be employed for device identification, authentication, secret key storage, and other security tasks. However, PUFs are susceptible to modeling attacks if a number of PUFs' challenge-response pairs (CRPs) are exposed to the adversary. Furthermore, many of the embedded devices requiring authentication have stringent resource constraints and thus require a lightweight authentication mechanism. We propose PUF-RLA, a PUF-based lightweight, highly reliable authentication scheme employing binary string shuffling. The proposed scheme enhances the reliability of PUF as well as alleviates the resource constraints by employing error correction in the server instead of the device without compromising the security. The proposed PUF-RLA is robust against brute force, replay, and modeling attacks. In PUF-RLA, we introduce an inexpensive yet secure stream authentication scheme inside the device which authenticates the server before the underlying PUF can be invoked. This prevents an adversary from brute forcing the device's PUF to acquire CRPs essentially locking out the device from unauthorized model generation. Additionally, we also introduce a lightweight CRP obfuscation mechanism involving XOR and shuffle operations. Results and security analysis verify that the PUF-RLA is secure against brute force, replay, and modeling attacks, and provides ~99% reliable authentication. In addition, PUF-RLA provides a reduction of 63% and 74% for look-up tables (LUTs) and register count, respectively, in FPGA compared to a recently proposed approach while providing additional authentication advantages.",

    "abstract": "Password-authenticated identities, where users establish username-password pairs with individual servers and use them later on for authentication, is the most widespread user authentication method over the Internet. Although they are simple, user-friendly, and broadly adopted, they offer insecure authentication and position server operators as trusted parties, giving them full control over users' identities. To mitigate these limitations, many identity systems have embraced public-key cryptography and the concept of decentralization. All these systems, however, require users to create and manage public-private keypairs. Unfortunately, users usually do not have the required knowledge and resources to properly handle their cryptographic secrets, which arguably contributed to failures of many end-user-focused public-key infrastructures (PKIs). In fact, as for today, no end-user PKI, able to authenticate users to web servers, has a significant adoption rate. In this paper, we propose Password-authenticated Decentralized Identities (PDIDs), an identity and authentication framework where users can register their self-sovereign username-password pairs and use them as universal credentials. Our system provides global namespace, human-meaningful usernames, and resilience against username collision attacks. A user's identity can be used to authenticate the user to any server without revealing that server anything about the password, such that no offline dictionary attacks are possible against the password. We analyze PDIDs and implement it using existing infrastructures and tools. We report on our implementation and evaluation.",

In a systematic experiment designed to test how this behavioral pattern exhibits consistency over time, we collected touch data from users interacting with a smart phone using basic navigation maneuvers, i.e., up-down and left-right scrolling. We propose a classification framework that learns the touch behavior of a user during an enrollment phase and is able to accept or reject the current user by monitoring interaction with the touch screen. The classifier achieves a median equal error rate of 0% for intra-session authentication, 2%-3% for inter-session authentication and below 4% when the authentication test was carried out one week after the enrollment phase. While our experimental findings disqualify this method as a standalone authentication mechanism for long-term authentication, it could be implemented as a means to extend screen-lock time or as a part of a multi-modal biometric authentication system.",

By analyzing other similar schemes, we find that the certain type of dynamic ID based multi-server authentication scheme in which only hash functions are used and no registration center participates in the authentication and session key agreement phase is hard to provide perfect efficient and secure authentication. To compensate for these shortcomings, we improve the recently proposed Liao et al.'s multi-server authentication scheme which is based on pairing and self-certified public keys, and propose a novel dynamic ID based remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environments. Liao et al.'s scheme is found vulnerable to offline dictionary attack and denial of service attack, and cannot provide user's anonymity and local password verification.

The existing works perform the research from two aspects, i.e., (a)secure key division and distributed storage, (b)secure distributed authentication. But there still exist several unsolved problems. Specifically, it may suffer from cheating problems and fault authentication attack, which can result in authentication failure and DoS attack towards authentication service. Besides, most existing schemes are not with satisfactory efficiency due to exponential arithmetic based on Shamir's scheme. In this paper, we explore the property of verifiable secret sharing(VSS) schemes with Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), then propose a secret key distributed storage scheme based on CRT-VSS and trusted computing for MANET. Specifically, we utilize trusted computing technology to solve two existing cheating problems in secret sharing area before. After that, we do the analysis of homomorphism property with CRT-VSS and design the corresponding shares-product sharing scheme with better concision. On such basis, a secure distributed Elliptic Curve-Digital Signature Standard signature (ECC-DSS) authentication scheme based on CRT-VSS scheme and trusted computing is proposed. Furthermore, as an important property of authentication scheme, we discuss the refreshing property of CRT-VSS and do thorough comparisons with Shamir's scheme. Finally, we provide formal guarantees towards our schemes proposed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Wallet may be described as container application used for configuring, accessing and analysing data from underlying payment application(s). There are two dominant types of digital wallet applications, proximity wallet and remote wallet. In the payment industry, one often hears about authentication approach for proximity or remote wallets or the underlying payment applications separately, but there is no such approach, as per our knowledge, for combined wallet, the holder application. While Secure Element (SE) controlled by the mobile network operator (i.e., SIM card) may ensure strong authentication, it introduces strong dependencies among business partners in payments and hence is not getting fraction. Embedded SE in the form of trusted execution environment [3, 4, 5] or trusted computing [24] may address this issue in future. But such devices tend to be a bit expensive and are not abundant in the market. Meanwhile, for many years, context based authentication involving device fingerprinting and other contextual information for conditional multi-factor authentication, would prevail and would remain as the most dominant and strong authentication mechanism for mobile devices from various vendors in different capability and price ranges. EMVCo payment token standard published in 2014 tries to address security of wallet based payment in a general way. The authors believe that it is quite likely that EMVCo payment token implementations would evolve in course of time in such a way that token service providers would start insisting on device fingerprinting as strong means of authentication before issuing one-time-use payment token.

    "abstract": "Current alphanumeric and biometric authentication systems cannot withstand situations where a user is coerced into releasing their authentication materials under hostile circumstances. Existing approaches of coercion resistant authentication systems (CRAS) propose authentication factors such as implicit learning tasks, which are non-transferable, but still have the drawback that an attacker can force the victim (causing stress) to perform the task in order to gain unauthorized access. Alternatively, there could be cases where the user could claim that they were coerced into giving up the authentication materials, whereas in reality they acted as an insider attacker. Therefore, being able to detect stress during authentication also helps to achieve non-repudiation in such cases. To address these concerns, we need CRAS that have both the non-transferable property as well as a mechanism to detect stress related to coercion. In this paper, we study the feasibility of using Chill (intensely pleasurable) music as a stimulus to elicit unique neuro-physiological responses that can be used as an authenticating factor for CRAS. Chill music and stress are both stimuli for a neuro-chemical called Dopamine. However, they release the Dopamine at different parts of the brain, resulting in different neuro-physiological responses, which gives us both the non-transferable and stress-detection properties necessary for CRAS. We have experimentally validated our proposed Chill music based CRAS using human subjects and measuring their neuro-physiological responses on our prototype system. Based on the 100 samples collected from the subjects, we were able to successfully authenticate the subjects with an accuracy of over 90\\%. Our work not only demonstrates the potential of Chill music as a unique stimulus for CRAS, but also paves the path of wider adoption of CRAS in general.",

    "abstract": "Architectures relying on continuous authentication require a secure way to challenge the user's identity without trusting that the Continuous Authentication Subsystem (CAS) has not been compromised, i.e., that the response to the layer which manages service/application access is not fake. In this paper, we introduce the CALIPER protocol, in which a separate Continuous Access Verification Entity (CAVE) directly challenges the user's identity in a continuous authentication regime. Instead of simply returning authentication probabilities or confidence scores, CALIPER's CAS uses live hard and soft biometric samples from the user to extract a cryptographic private key embedded in a challenge posed by the CAVE. The CAS then uses this key to sign a response to the CAVE. CALIPER supports multiple modalities, key lengths, and security levels and can be applied in two scenarios: One where the CAS must authenticate its user to a CAVE running on a remote server (device-server) for access to remote application data, and another where the CAS must authenticate its user to a locally running trusted computing module (TCM) for access to local application data (device-TCM). We further demonstrate that CALIPER can leverage device hardware resources to enable privacy and security even when the device's kernel is compromised, and we show how this authentication protocol can even be expanded to obfuscate direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) malwares.",

In this paper, the private authentication problem is considered, that consists of a certificate authority, a verifier, many legitimate users (prover) and any arbitrary number of illegitimate users. Each legitimate user wants to be authenticated (using his personal key) by the verifier, while simultaneously wants to stay completely anonymous (even to the verifier and the CA). On the other hand, an illegitimate user must fail to authenticate himself. We analyze this problem from an information theoretical perspective. First, we propose a general interactive information-theoretic model for the problem. As a metric to measure the reliability, we consider the authentication key rate whose rate maximization has a trade-off with establishing privacy. Then, we analyze the problem in two different regimes: finite size regime (i.e., the variables are elements of a finite field) and asymptotic regime (i.e., the variables are considered to have large enough length). For both regimes, we propose schemes that satisfy the completeness, soundness and privacy properties. In finite size regime, the idea is to generate the authentication keys according to a secret sharing scheme. In asymptotic regime, we use a random binning based scheme which relies on the joint typicality to generate the authentication keys. Moreover, providing the converse proof, we show that our scheme achieves capacity in the asymptotic regime. For finite size regime our scheme achieves capacity for large field size.",

Various attacks expose patients' data for malicious tampering or destruction. Transferring health-related data and information between users and the health centre makes them exposed to penetration by adversaries as they may move through an insecure channel. In addition, previous mechanisms have suffered from the poor protection of users' authentication information. To ensure the protection of patients' information and data, we propose a scheme that authenticates users based on the information of both the device and the legitimate user. In this paper, we propose a Robust Authentication Model for Healthcare Users (RAMHU) that provides mutual authentication between server and clients. This model utilizes an Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) and PHOTON to achieve strong security and a good overall performance. RAMHU relies on multi pseudonyms, physical address, and one-time password mechanisms to authenticate legitimate users. Moreover, extensive informal and formal security analysis with the automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool demonstrates that our model offers a high level of security in repelling a wide variety of possible attacks.",

    "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables unconditionally secure communication between distinct parties using a quantum channel and an authentic public channel. Reducing the portion of quantum-generated secret keys, that is consumed during the authentication procedure, is of significant importance for improving the performance of QKD systems. In the present work, we develop a lightweight authentication protocol for QKD based on a `ping-pong' scheme of authenticity check for QKD. An important feature of this scheme is that the only one authentication tag is generated and transmitted during each of the QKD post-processing rounds. For the tag generation purpose, we design an unconditionally secure procedure based on the concept of key recycling. The procedure is based on the combination of almost universal$_2$ polynomial hashing, XOR universal$_2$ Toeplitz hashing, and one-time pad (OTP) encryption. We demonstrate how to minimize both the length of the recycled key and the size of the authentication key, that is required for OTP encryption. As a result, in real case scenarios, the portion of quantum-generated secret keys that is consumed for the authentication purposes is below 1\\%. Finally, we provide a security analysis of the full quantum key growing process in the framework of universally composable security.",

The LTE fulfills the resource demands of the next generation applications for now. We identify security issues in the authentication mechanism used in LTE that without countermeasures might give superuser rights to unauthorized users. The LTE uses static LTE Key (LTE-K) to derive the entire key hierarchy such as LTE follows Evolved Packet System-Authentication and Key Agreement (EPS-AKA) based authentication which discloses user identity, location, and other Personally Identifiable Information (PII). To counter this, we propose a public key cryptosystem named International mobile subscriber identity Protected Console Grid-based Authentication and Key Agreement (IPG-AKA) protocol to address the vulnerabilities related to weak key management. From the data obtained from threat modeling and simulation results, we claim that the IPG-AKA scheme not only improves the security of authentication procedures, it also shows improvements in authentication loads and reduction in key generation time. The empirical results and qualitative analysis presented in this paper proves that IPG-AKA improves security in authentication procedure and performance in the LTE.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) networks are becoming a part of our daily lives, as the number of IoT devices around us are surging. The authentication of millions of connected things and the distribution and management of secret keys between these devices pose challenging research problems. Current one-to-one authentication schemes do not take the resource limitations of IoT devices into consideration. Nor do they address the scalability problem of massive machine type communication (mMTC) networks. Group authentication schemes (GAS), on the other hand, have emerged as novel approaches for many-to-many authentication problems. They can be used to simultaneously authenticate numerous resource-constrained devices. However, existing GAS are not energy efficient, and they do not provide enough security for widespread use. In this paper, we propose a lightweight GAS that significantly reduces energy consumption on devices, providing almost 80% energy savings when compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Our approach is also resistant to the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. The proposed approach also includes a solution for key agreement and key distribution problems in mMTC environments. Moreover, this approach can be used in both centralized and decentralized group authentication scenarios. The proposed approach has the potential to address the fast authentication requirements of the envisioned agile 6G networks, supported through aerial networking nodes.",

    "abstract": "In resource-constrained IoT networks, the use of conventional message authentication codes (MACs) to provide message authentication and integrity is not possible due to the large size of the MAC output. A straightforward yet naive solution to this problem is to employ a truncated MAC which undesirably sacrifices cryptographic strength in exchange for reduced communication overhead. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel approach for message authentication called \\textit{Cumulative Message Authentication Code} (CuMAC), which consists of two distinctive procedures: \\textit{aggregation} and \\textit{accumulation}. In aggregation, a sender generates compact authentication tags from segments of multiple MACs by using a systematic encoding procedure. In accumulation, a receiver accumulates the cryptographic strength of the underlying MAC by collecting and verifying the authentication tags. Embodied with these two procedures, CuMAC enables the receiver to achieve an advantageous trade-off between the cryptographic strength and the latency in processing of the authentication tags. Furthermore, for some latency-sensitive messages where this trade-off may be unacceptable, we propose a variant of CuMAC that we refer to as \\textit{CuMAC with Speculation} (CuMAC/S). In addition to the aggregation and accumulation procedures, CuMAC/S enables the sender and receiver to employ a speculation procedure for predicting future message values and pre-computing the corresponding MAC segments. For the messages which can be reliably speculated, CuMAC/S significantly reduces the MAC verification latency without compromising the cryptographic strength. We have carried out comprehensive evaluation of CuMAC and CuMAC/S through simulation and a prototype implementation on a real car.",

While existing continuous authentication systems have demonstrated their suitability for single-device scenarios, the Internet of Things and next generation of mobile networks (5G) are enabling novel multi-device scenarios -- such as Smart Offices -- where continuous authentication is still an open challenge. The paper at hand, proposes an AI-based, privacy-preserving and multi-device continuous authentication architecture called AuthCODE. A realistic Smart Office scenario with several users, interacting with their mobile devices and personal computer, has been used to create a set of single- and multi-device behavioural datasets and validate AuthCODE. A pool of experiments with machine and deep learning classifiers measured the impact of time in authentication accuracy and improved the results of single-device approaches by considering multi-device behaviour profiles. The f1-score average reached for XGBoost on multi-device profiles based on 1-minute windows was 99.33%, while the best performance achieved for single devices was lower than 97.39%. The inclusion of temporal information in the form of vector sequences classified by a Long-Short Term Memory Network, allowed the identification of additional complex behaviour patterns associated to each user, resulting in an average f1-score of 99.02% on identification of long-term behaviours.",

This not only allows users to authenticate each other via shared low-entropy secrets, e.g., memorable words, without a public key infrastructure or a trusted third party, but it also paves the way for automation and a series of cryptographic enhancements; improves security by minimizing the impact of human error and potentially improves usability. First, we study a few vulnerabilities in voice-based out-of-band authentication, in particular a combinatorial attack against lazy users, which we analyze in the context of a secure email solution. Next, we propose solving the problem of secure equality test using PAKE to achieve entity authentication and to establish a shared high-entropy secret key. Our solution lends itself to offline settings, compatible with the inherently asynchronous nature of email and modern messaging systems. The suggested approach enables enhancements in key management such as automated key renewal and future key pair authentications, multi-device synchronization, secure secret storage and retrieval, and the possibility of post-quantum security as well as facilitating forward secrecy and deniability in a primarily symmetric-key setting. We also discuss the use of auditable PAKEs for mitigating a class of online guess and abort attacks in authentication protocols.",

However, authentication between vehicle users and an aggregator may be vulnerable to various attacks due to the usage of wireless communications. In order to reduce the computational costs yet preserve required security, the Chebyshev chaotic map based authentication schemes are proposed. However, the security requirements of Chebyshev polynomials bring a new challenge to the design of authentication schemes based on Chebyshev chaotic maps. To solve this issue, we propose a practical Chebyshev polynomial algorithm by using a binary exponentiation algorithm based on square matrix to achieve secure and efficient Chebyshev polynomial computation. We further apply the proposed algorithm to construct an energy-efficient authentication and key agreement scheme for smart grid environments. Compared with state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed authentication scheme effectively reduces the computational costs and communication costs by adopting the proposed Chebyshev polynomial algorithm. Furthermore, the ProVerif tool is employed to analyze the security of the proposed authentication scheme.

Even high-security applications such as Internet Banking portals, which deploy 2-factor authentication, rely on password authentication as one of the authentication factors. However phishing attacks continue to plague password-based authentication despite aggressive efforts in detection and takedown as well as comprehensive user awareness and training programs. There is currently no foolproof mechanism even for security-conscious websites to prevent users from being directed to fraudulent websites and having their passwords phished. In this paper, we apply a threat analysis on the web password login process, and uncover a design vulnerability in the HTML<inputtype=\"password\"> field. This vulnerability can be exploited for phishing attacks as the web authentication process is not end-to-end secured from each input password field to the web server. We identify four properties that encapsulate the requirements to stop web-based password phishing, and propose a secure protocol to be used with a new credential field that complies with the four properties. We further analyze the proposed protocol through an abuse-case evaluation, discuss various deployment issues, and also perform a test implementation to understand its data and execution overheads",

The aim of this paper is to propose two authentication schemes based on general non-commutative rings. The key idea of the schemes is that for a given non-commutative ring; one can build polynomials on additive structure and takes them as underlying work structure. By doing so, one can implement authentication schemes, one of them being zero-knowledge interactive proofs of knowledge, on multiplicative structure of the ring. The security of the schemes is based on the intractability of the polynomial symmetrical decomposition problem over the given non-commutative ring.",

The ability of the ANFIS-based system to detect an adversary is also tested with scenarios involving an attacker with varying levels of knowledge. The results demonstrate that ANFIS is a feasible and efficient approach for implicit authentication with an average of 95% user recognition rate.

    "abstract": "Authentication and authorization are critical security layers to protect a wide range of online systems, services and content. However, the increased prevalence of wearable and mobile devices, the expectations of a frictionless experience and the diverse user environments will challenge the way users are authenticated. Consumers demand secure and privacy-aware access from any device, whenever and wherever they are, without any obstacles. This paper reviews emerging trends and challenges with frictionless authentication systems and identifies opportunities for further research related to the enrollment of users, the usability of authentication schemes, as well as security and privacy trade-offs of mobile and wearable continuous authentication systems.",

    "abstract": "We investigate quantum authentication schemes constructed from quantum error-correcting codes. We show that if the code has a property called purity testing, then the resulting authentication scheme guarantees the integrity of ciphertexts, not just plaintexts. On top of that, if the code is strong purity testing, the authentication scheme also allows the encryption key to be recycled, partially even if the authentication rejects. Such a strong notion of authentication is useful in a setting where multiple ciphertexts can be present simultaneously, such as in interactive or delegated quantum computation. With these settings in mind, we give an explicit code (based on the trap code) that is strong purity testing but, contrary to other known strong-purity-testing codes, allows for natural computation on ciphertexts.",

Although such techniques offer an automated method to establish identity, they have not been vetted against sophisticated attacks that target their core machine learning technique. This paper demonstrates that mimicking the unique signatures generated by host fingerprinting and biometric authentication systems is possible. We expose the ineffectiveness of underlying machine learning classification models by constructing a blind attack based around the query synthesis framework and utilizing Explainable-AI (XAI) techniques. We launch an attack in under 130 queries on a state-of-the-art face authentication system, and under 100 queries on a host authentication system. We examine how these attacks can be defended against and explore their limitations. XAI provides an effective means for adversaries to infer decision boundaries and provides a new way forward in constructing attacks against systems using machine learning models for authentication.",

In addition to being cumbersome and obtrusive to the users, such authentication mechanisms pose security and privacy concerns. Passive authentication systems can tackle these challenges by frequently and unobtrusively monitoring the user's interaction with the device. In this paper, we propose a Siamese Long Short-Term Memory network architecture for passive authentication, where users can be verified without requiring any explicit authentication step. We acquired a dataset comprising of measurements from 30 smartphone sensor modalities for 37 users. We evaluate our approach on 8 dominant modalities, namely, keystroke dynamics, GPS location, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, linear accelerometer, gravity, and rotation sensors. Experimental results find that, within 3 seconds, a genuine user can be correctly verified 97.15% of the time at a false accept rate of 0.1%.",

In this study, a novel method is proposed to provide a secure group authentication. The proposed approach also enables a hand-over process between groups by using Lagrange's polynomial interpolation and Weil pairing in elliptic curve groups for wireless networks with mobility support. One of the advantages of our proposed scheme is that the computational load for a member in the group is lower than the other schemes in the state-of-the-art. It is also possible to authorize many users at the same time, not one-to-one as in the group authentication methods in current cellular networks including Long Term Evolution (LTE). Another advantage that is not covered in other secret sharing methods is that the proposed approach constitutes a practical solution for the hand-over of members between different groups.

Authentication is one of the most important security requirements in these networks. So many authentication schemes have been proposed up to now. One of the well-known techniques to provide users authentication in these networks is the authentication based on the smartcard (ASC).

However, most of the protocols are vulnerable to various security attacks and their performance is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a secure and energy-efficient remote user authentication protocol for multi-server systems. The results show that the proposed protocol is comparatively ~44% more efficient and needs ~38% less communication cost.

However, widely researched human user characteristics-based CA mechanisms cannot be extended to continuously authenticate Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The challenges are exacerbated with increased adoption of device-to-device (d2d) communication in critical infrastructures. Existing d2d authentication protocols proposed in the literature are either prone to subversion or are computationally infeasible to be deployed on constrained IoT devices. In view of these challenges, we propose a novel, lightweight, and secure CA protocol that leverages communication channel properties and a tunable mathematical function to generate dynamically changing session keys. Our preliminary informal protocol analysis suggests that the proposed protocol is resistant to known attack vectors and thus has strong potential for deployment in securing critical and resource-constrained d2d communication.",

    "abstract": "Two-factor authentication protects online accounts even if passwords are leaked. Most users, however, prefer password-only authentication. One reason why two-factor authentication is so unpopular is the extra steps that the user must complete in order to log in. Currently deployed two-factor authentication mechanisms require the user to interact with his phone to, for example, copy a verification code to the browser. Two-factor authentication schemes that eliminate user-phone interaction exist, but require additional software to be deployed. In this paper we propose Sound-Proof, a usable and deployable two-factor authentication mechanism. Sound-Proof does not require interaction between the user and his phone. In Sound-Proof the second authentication factor is the proximity of the user's phone to the device being used to log in. The proximity of the two devices is verified by comparing the ambient noise recorded by their microphones. Audio recording and comparison are transparent to the user, so that the user experience is similar to the one of password-only authentication. Sound-Proof can be easily deployed as it works with current phones and major browsers without plugins. We build a prototype for both Android and iOS. We provide empirical evidence that ambient noise is a robust discriminant to determine the proximity of two devices both indoors and outdoors, and even if the phone is in a pocket or purse. We conduct a user study designed to compare the perceived usability of Sound-Proof with Google 2-Step Verification. Participants ranked Sound-Proof as more usable and the majority would be willing to use Sound-Proof even for scenarios in which two-factor authentication is optional.",

In this paper we define and investigate the authentication of messages composed of quantum states. Assuming S and R have access to an insecure quantum channel and share a private, classical random key, we provide a non-interactive scheme that enables S both to encrypt and to authenticate (with unconditional security) an m qubit message by encoding it into m+s qubits, where the failure probability decreases exponentially in the security parameter s. The classical private key is 2m+O(s) bits. To achieve this, we give a highly efficient protocol for testing the purity of shared EPR pairs. We also show that any scheme to authenticate quantum messages must also encrypt them. (In contrast, one can authenticate a classical message while leaving it publicly readable.) This has two important consequences: On one hand, it allows us to give a lower bound of 2m key bits for authenticating m qubits, which makes our protocol asymptotically optimal. On the other hand, we use it to show that digitally signing quantum states is impossible, even with only computational security.",

    "abstract": "Recently, authenticating users with the help of their friends (i.e., trustee-based social authentication) has been shown to be a promising backup authentication mechanism. A user in this system is associated with a few trustees that were selected from the user's friends. When the user wants to regain access to the account, the service provider sends different verification codes to the user's trustees. The user must obtain at least k (i.e., recovery threshold) verification codes from the trustees before being directed to reset his or her password. In this paper, we provide the first systematic study about the security of trustee-based social authentications. Specifically, we first introduce a novel framework of attacks, which we call forest fire attacks. In these attacks, an attacker initially obtains a small number of compromised users, and then the attacker iteratively attacks the rest of users by exploiting trustee-based social authentications. Then, we construct a probabilistic model to formalize the threats of forest fire attacks and their costs for attackers. Moreover, we introduce various defense strategies. Finally, we apply our framework to extensively evaluate various concrete attack and defense strategies using three real-world social network datasets. Our results have strong implications for the design of more secure trustee-based social authentications.",

We explore the use of LCS in location-enhanced server authentication, which traditionally relies on certificates. Given recent incidents involving certificate authorities, various techniques to strengthen server authentication were proposed. They focus on improving the certificate validation process, such as pinning, revocation, or multi-path probing. In this paper, we propose using the server's geographic location as a second factor of its authenticity. Our solution, SALVE, achieves location-based server authentication by using secure DNS resolution and by leveraging LCS for location measurements. We develop a TLS extension that enables the client to verify the server's location in addition to its certificate. Successful server authentication therefore requires a valid certificate and the server's presence at a legitimate geographic location, e.g., on the premises of a data center. SALVE prevents server impersonation by remote adversaries with mis-issued certificates or stolen private keys of the legitimate server. We develop a prototype implementation and our evaluation in real-world settings shows that it incurs minimal impact to the average server throughput. Our solution is backward compatible and can be integrated with existing approaches for improving server authentication in TLS.",

Operating in the background, our system implicitly observes users' phone pick-up movements, the way they bend their arms when they pick up a smartphone to interact with the device, to authenticate the users. Our SPU outperforms the state-of-the-art implicit authentication mechanisms in three main aspects: 1) SPU automatically learns the user's behavioral pattern without requiring a large amount of training data (especially those of other users) as previous methods did, making it more deployable. Towards this end, we propose a weighted multi-dimensional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to effectively quantify similarities between users' pick-up movements; 2) SPU does not rely on a remote server for providing further computational power, making SPU efficient and usable even without network access; and 3) our system can adaptively update a user's authentication model to accommodate user's behavioral drift over time with negligible overhead. Through extensive experiments on real world datasets, we demonstrate that SPU can achieve authentication accuracy up to 96.3% with a very low latency of 2.4 milliseconds. It reduces the number of times a user has to do explicit authentication by 32.9%, while effectively defending against various attacks.",

Previous solutions, such as Secure Sketch and Fuzzy Extractors, rely on assumptions that cannot be guaranteed in practice, and often affect the authentication accuracy. In this paper, we introduce HoneyFaces: the concept of adding a large set of synthetic faces (indistinguishable from real) into the biometric \"password file\". This password inflation protects the privacy of users and increases the security of the system without affecting the accuracy of the authentication. In particular, privacy for the real users is provided by \"hiding\" them among a large number of fake users (as the distributions of synthetic and real faces are equal). In addition to maintaining the authentication accuracy, and thus not affecting the security of the authentication process, HoneyFaces offer several security improvements: increased exfiltration hardness, improved leakage detection, and the ability to use a Two-server setting like in HoneyWords. Finally, HoneyFaces can be combined with other security and privacy mechanisms for biometric data. We implemented the HoneyFaces system and tested it with a password file composed of 270 real users. The \"password file\" was then inflated to accommodate up to $2^{36.5}$ users (resulting in a 56.6 TB \"password file\"). At the same time, the inclusion of additional faces does not affect the true acceptance rate or false acceptance rate which were 93.33\\% and 0.01\\%, respectively.",

In recent years, blockchain technology has been introduced as a panacea to our security problems, including that of authentication, without sufficient reasoning, as to its merits.In this work, we investigate the merits of using open distributed ledgers (ODLs), such as the one implemented by blockchain technology, for securing TM systems for authentication. We formally model such systems, and explore how blockchain can help mitigate attacks against them. After formal argumentation, we conclude that in the context of Trust Management for authentication, blockchain technology, and ODLs in general, can offer considerable advantages compared to previous approaches. Our analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to formally model and argue about the security of TM systems for authentication, based on blockchain technology. To achieve this result, we first provide an abstract model for TM systems for authentication. Then, we show how this model can be conceptually encoded in a blockchain, by expressing it as a series of state transitions. As a next step, we examine five prevalent attacks on TM systems, and provide evidence that blockchain-based solutions can be beneficial to the security of such systems, by mitigating, or completely negating such attacks.",

    "abstract": "Cloud-based services have become part of our day-to-day software solutions. The identity authentication process is considered to be the main gateway to these services. As such, these gates have become increasingly susceptible to aggressive attackers, who may use Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to close these gates permanently. There are a number of authentication protocols that are strong enough to verify identities and protect traditional networked applications. However, these authentication protocols may themselves introduce DoS risks when used in cloud-based applications. This risk introduction is due to the utilization of a heavy verification process that may consume the cloud resources and disable the application service. In this work, we propose a novel cloud-based authentication protocol suite that not only is aware of the internal DoS threats but is also capable of defending against external DoS attackers. The proposed solution uses a multilevel adaptive technique to dictate the efforts of the protocol participants. This technique is capable of identifying a legitimate users requests and placing them at the front of the authentication process queue. The authentication process was designed in such a way that the cloud-based servers become footprint-free and completely aware of the risks of any DoS attack.",

This paper investigates whether glass wearable devices can be used to authenticate users, both to grant access (one-time) and to maintain access (continuous), in similar hands-free fashion. We do so by designing and implementing Gauth, a system that enables users to authenticate with a service simply by issuing a voice command, while facing the computer terminal they are going to use to access the service. To achieve this goal, we create a physical communication channel from the terminal to the device using machine readable visual codes, like QR codes, and utilize the device's network adapter to communicate directly with a service. More importantly, we continuously authenticate the user accessing the terminal, exploiting the fact that a user operating a terminal is most likely facing it most of the time. We periodically issue authentication challenges, which are displayed as a QR code on the terminal, that cause the glass device to re-authenticate the user with an appropriate response. We evaluate our system to determine the technical limits of our approach.",

To determine the boundaries of datasets, use case analysis is adopted. Based on various application scenarios on ECG based authentication, three distinct use cases (or authentication categories) are developed. With more qualified training data given to corresponding machine learning schemes, the precision on ML-based ECG biometric authentication mechanisms is increased in consequence. ECG time slicing technique with the R-peak anchoring is utilized in this framework to acquire ML training data with good quality. In the proposed framework four new measure metrics are introduced to evaluate the quality of ML training and testing data. In addition, a Matlab toolbox, containing all proposed mechanisms, metrics and sample data with demonstrations using various ML techniques, is developed and made publicly available for further investigation. For developing ML-based ECG biometric authentication, the proposed framework can guide researchers to prepare the proper ML setups and the ML training datasets along with three identified user case scenarios. For researchers adopting ML techniques to design new schemes in other research domains, the proposed framework is still useful for generating ML-based training and testing datasets with good quality and utilizing new measure metrics.",

    "abstract": "Mouse dynamics is a potential means of authenticating users. Typically, the authentication process is based on classical machine learning techniques, but recently, deep learning techniques have been introduced for this purpose. Although prior research has demonstrated how machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be bypassed by carefully crafted adversarial samples, there has been very little research performed on the topic of behavioural biometrics in the adversarial domain. In an attempt to address this gap, we built a set of attacks, which are applications of several generative approaches, to construct adversarial mouse trajectories that bypass authentication models. These generated mouse sequences will serve as the adversarial samples in the context of our experiments. We also present an analysis of the attack approaches we explored, explaining their limitations. In contrast to previous work, we consider the attacks in a more realistic and challenging setting in which an attacker has access to recorded user data but does not have access to the authentication model or its outputs. We explore three different attack strategies: 1) statistics-based, 2) imitation-based, and 3) surrogate-based; we show that they are able to evade the functionality of the authentication models, thereby impacting their robustness adversely. We show that imitation-based attacks often perform better than surrogate-based attacks, unless, however, the attacker can guess the architecture of the authentication model. In such cases, we propose a potential detection mechanism against surrogate-based attacks.",

    "abstract": "Traditional authentication systems use alphanumeric or graphical passwords, or token-based techniques that require \"something you know and something you have\". The disadvantages of these systems include the risks of forgetfulness, loss, and theft. To address these shortcomings, biometric authentication is rapidly replacing traditional authentication methods and is becoming a part of everyday life. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most recent traits considered for biometric purposes. In this work we describe an ECG-based authentication system suitable for security checks and hospital environments. The proposed system will help investigators studying ECG-based biometric authentication techniques to define dataset boundaries and to acquire high-quality training data. We evaluated the performance of the proposed system and found that it could achieve up to the 92 percent identification accuracy. In addition, by applying the Amang ECG (amgecg) toolbox within MATLAB, we investigated the two parameters that directly affect the accuracy of authentication: the ECG slicing time (sliding window) and the sampling time period, and found their optimal values.",

    "abstract": "Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are a particular subclass of mobile ad hoc networks that raise a number of security challenges, notably from the way users authenticate the network. Authentication technologies based on existing security policies and access control rules in such networks assume full trust on Roadside Unit (RSU) and authentication servers. The disclosure of authentication parameters enables user's trace-ability over the network. VANETs' trusted entities (e.g. RSU) can utilize such information to track a user traveling behavior, violating user privacy and anonymity. In this paper, we proposed a novel, light-weight, Adaptive Group-based Zero Knowledge Proof-Authentication Protocol (AGZKP-AP) for VANETs. The proposed authentication protocol is capable of offering various levels of users' privacy settings based on the type of services available on such networks. Our scheme is based on the Zero-Knowledge-Proof (ZKP) crypto approach with the support of trade-off options. Users have the option to make critical decisions on the level of privacy and the amount of resources usage they prefer such as short system response time versus the number of private information disclosures. Furthermore, AGZKP-AP is incorporated with a distributed privilege control and revoking mechanism that render user's private information to law enforcement in case of a traffic violation.",

    "abstract": "Biometric authentication is getting increasingly popular due to the convenience of using unique individual traits, such as fingerprints, palm veins, irises. Especially fingerprints are widely used nowadays due to the availability and low cost of fingerprint scanners. To avoid identity theft or impersonation, fingerprint data is typically stored locally, e.g., in a trusted hardware module, in a single device that is used for user enrollment and authentication. Local storage, however, limits the ability to implement distributed applications, in which users can enroll their fingerprint once and use it to access multiple physical locations and mobile applications afterwards. In this paper, we present a distributed authentication system that stores fingerprint data in a server or cloud infrastructure in a privacy-preserving way. Multiple devices can be connected and perform user enrollment or verification. To secure the privacy and integrity of sensitive data, we employ a cryptographic construct called fuzzy vault. We highlight challenges in implementing fuzzy vault-based authentication, for which we propose and compare alternative solutions. We conduct a security analysis of our biometric cryptosystem, and as a proof of concept, we build an authentication system for access control using resource-constrained devices (Raspberry Pis) connected to fingerprint scanners and the Microsoft Azure cloud environment. Furthermore, we evaluate the fingerprint matching algorithm against the well-known FVC2006 database and show that it can achieve comparable accuracy to widely-used matching techniques that are not designed for privacy, while remaining efficient with an authentication time of few seconds.",

This authentication code, featuring low key consumption, is not Information-Theoretically Secure (ITS) since for each message the eavesdropper has intercepted she is able to send a different message from a set of messages that she can calculate by finding collisions of a cryptographic hash function. However, when this authentication code was introduced it was shown to prevent straightforward Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks against QKD protocols. In this paper, we prove that the set of messages that collide with any given message under this authentication code contains with high probability a message that has small Hamming distance to any other given message. Based on this fact we present extended MITM attacks against different versions of BB84 QKD protocols using the addressed authentication code; for three protocols we describe every single action taken by the adversary. For all protocols the adversary can obtain complete knowledge of the key, and for most protocols her success probability in doing so approaches unity. Since the attacks work against all authentication methods which allow to calculate colliding messages, the underlying building blocks of the presented attacks expose the potential pitfalls arising as a consequence of non-ITS authentication in QKD-postprocessing. We propose countermeasures, increasing the eavesdroppers demand for computational power, and also prove necessary and sufficient conditions for upgrading the discussed authentication code to the ITS level.",

We characterize the optimal tradeoff between the identification rate, the compression rate of the users' source data, information leakage rate, and secret key rate. In particular, we provide a coding strategy based on layered random binning which is shown to be optimal. In addition, we study a related secure identification/authentication problem where an adversary tries to deceive the system using its own data. Here the optimal tradeoff between the identification rate, compression rate, leakage rate, and exponent of the maximum false acceptance probability is provided. The results reveal a close connection between the optimal secret key rate and the false acceptance exponent of the identification/authentication system.",

A major security concern of the outsourcing paradigm is to authenticate whether the service provider returns sound and complete search results. In this paper, we design AutoS3, an authentication mechanism of outsourced string similarity search. The key idea of AutoS3 is that the server returns a verification object VO to prove the result correctness. First, we design an authenticated string indexing structure named MBtree for VO construction. Second, we design two lightweight authentication methods named VS2 and EVS2 that can catch the service provider various cheating behaviors with cheap verification cost.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of authentication protocols for Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, we select and in-detail examine more than forty authentication protocols developed for or applied in the context of the IoT under four environments, including: (1) Machine to machine communications (M2M), (2) Internet of Vehicles (IoV), (3) Internet of Energy (IoE), and (4) Internet of Sensors (IoS). We start by reviewing all survey articles published in the recent years that focusing on different aspects of the IoT idea. Then, we review threat models, countermeasures, and formal security verification techniques used in authentication protocols for the IoT. In addition, we provide a taxonomy and comparison of authentication protocols for the IoT in form of tables in five terms, namely, network model, goals, main processes, computation complexity, and communication overhead. Based on the current survey, we identify open issues and suggest hints for future research.",

    "abstract": "Biometric Authentication has become a very popular method for different state-of-the-art security architectures. Albeit the ubiquitous acceptance and constant development of trivial biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint, palm-print, retinal scan etc., the possibility of producing a highly competitive performance from somewhat less-popular methods still remains. Electrocardiogram (ECG) based biometric authentication is such a method, which, despite its limited appearance in earlier research works, are currently being observed as equivalently high-performing as other trivial popular methods. In this paper, we have proposed a model to optimize the runtime of identification event in ECG based biometric authentication and we have achieved a maximum of 79.26% time reduction with 100% accuracy.",

Hence, an input image must first be authenticated before being fed into the recognition program. Thus, an image security identification and authentication requirement, any image that fails the authentication/verification stage are not to be used as an input/test image.

The protocol is contention-based and its main feature is that a device contends with a unique signature that also enables the authentication of the device towards the network. The signatures are inspired by Bloom filters and are created based on the output of the MILENAGE authentication and encryption algorithm set, which is used in the authentication and security procedures in the LTE protocol family. We show that our method utilizes the system resources more efficiently, achieves lower latency of connection establishment for Poisson arrivals and allows a $87\\%$ signalling overhead reduction. An important conclusion is that the mMTC traffic benefits profoundly from integration of security features into the connection establishment/access protocols, instead of addressing them post-hoc, which has been a common practice.",

The proposed scheme computes an aggregate score based on selected features and a threshold in real-time based on current and historic data depicting user routine. The tuned fuzzy system is then applied to the aggregated score and the threshold to determine the trust level of the current user. The proposed fuzzy-integrated implicit authentication scheme is designed to: operate adaptively and completely in the background, require minimal training period, enable high system accuracy while provide timely detection of abnormal activity. In this paper, we explore Fuzzy Logic based authentication in depth. Gaussian and triangle-based membership functions are investigated and compared using real data over several weeks from different Android phone users. The presented results show that our proposed Fuzzy Logic approach is a highly effective, and viable scheme for lightweight real-time implicit authentication on mobile devices.",

    "abstract": "We study the ensemble performance of biometric authentication systems, based on secret key generation, which work as follows. In the enrollment stage, an individual provides a biometric signal that is mapped into a secret key and a helper message, the former being prepared to become available to the system at a later time (for authentication), and the latter is stored in a public database. When an authorized user requests authentication, claiming his/her identity as one of the subscribers, s/he has to provide a biometric signal again, and then the system, which retrieves also the helper message of the claimed subscriber, produces an estimate of the secret key, that is finally compared to the secret key of the claimed user. In case of a match, the authentication request is approved, otherwise, it is rejected.Referring to an ensemble of systems based on Slepian-Wolf binning, we provide a detailed analysis of the false-reject and false-accept probabilities, for a wide class of stochastic decoders. We also comment on the security for the typical code in the ensemble.",

Circular UIs are tailored to smartwatches with fewer UI elements. Results show that 1) PIN is more accurate and secure than Pattern; 2) Pattern is much faster than PIN; 3) Square UIs are more secure but less accurate than Circular UIs; 4) display size does not affect accuracy or speed, but security; 5) Square PIN is the most secure method of all. The study also reveals a security concern that participants' favorite method is not the best in any of the measures. We finally discuss implications for future touch-based smartwatch authentication design.",

In this work, we propose a cloud-based authentication protocol - one that securely authenticates the cloud user and effectively prevents DoS attack on the cloud-computing system-by involving the user in a high computation process.

In general, for authentication, the client and the server mutually exchange a common cryptographic key. In earlier, passwords were stored on a single server. If an intruder gains access to the server by using some malicious attacks, then all the passwords stored in the database be compromised. So the e-commerce application security is endangered. In order to improve the efficiency and performance of the authentication scheme, we introduce multiple servers to store the passwords and participate in the key exchange and authentication schemes. This ensures entire systems' security even if a single server is compromised. The randomly generated nonce for each session corresponding to two-level security mechanism where the scope of an attacker pretends as legitimate user and login to the system is completely restricted. In this method, passwords are stored in their equivalent hash values and stored on multiple servers. This makes the attacker difficult to reverse engineer and intercept to determine the password even from segments of hash value. In this paper, we model a safe and secure password-based authentication scheme using a key exchange.",

In this paper, we provide an inner bound of achievable rates with an average authentication and reliability constraint. The bound is established by combining and analyzing two existing authentication schemes for both noisy and noiseless channels. We find that our coding scheme improves upon existing schemes.",

BodyPIN can track the current user's legal identity throughout a computer system's execution. In case the authentication fails, the consequent accesses will be denied to protect the system. The recent rich wireless-based user identification designs cannot be applied to BodyPIN directly, because they identify a user's various activities, rather than the user herself. The enforced to be performed activities can thus interrupt the user's operations on the system, highly inconvenient and not user-friendly. In this paper, we leverage the bio-electromagnetics domain human model for quantifying the impact of human body on the bypassing Wi-Fi signals and deriving the component that indicates a user's identity. Then we extract suitable Wi-Fi signal features to fully represent such an identity component, based on which we fulfill the continuous user authentication design. We implement a BodyPIN prototype by commodity Wi-Fi NICs without any extra or dedicated wireless hardware. We show that BodyPIN achieves promising authentication performances, which is also lightweight and robust under various practical settings.",

We identify shortcomings in an existing proposal by Xu et al for multiparty authentication and evaluate a novel model from Al-Aqrabi et al that has been designed specifically for complex multiple security realm environments. The adoption of a Session Authority Cloud ensures that resources for authentication requests are scalable, whilst permitting the necessary architectural abstraction for myriad hardware IoT devices such as actuators and sensor networks, etc. In addition, the ability to ensure that session credentials are confirmed with the relevant resource principles means that the essential rigour for multiparty authentication is established.",

    "abstract": "Active authentication refers to the process in which users are unobtrusively monitored and authenticated continuously throughout their interactions with mobile devices. Generally, an active authentication problem is modelled as a one class classification problem due to the unavailability of data from the impostor users. Normally, the enrolled user is considered as the target class (genuine) and the unauthorized users are considered as unknown classes (impostor). We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for one class classification in which a zero centered Gaussian noise and an autoencoder are used to model the pseudo-negative class and to regularize the network to learn meaningful feature representations for one class data, respectively. The overall network is trained using a combination of the cross-entropy and the reconstruction error losses. A key feature of the proposed approach is that any pre-trained CNN can be used as the base network for one class classification. Effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated using three publically available face-based active authentication datasets and it is shown that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to the traditional one class classification methods.

To address this issue, we propose a novel two-stage method that disentangles the class/identity from domain-differences, and we consider multiple types of domain-difference. In the first stage, we learn disentangled representations by a one-versus-rest disentangle learning (OVRDL) mechanism. In the second stage, we improve the disentanglement by an additive adversarial learning (AAL) mechanism.

Authentication is performed solely through user to RP communications (eliminating fees and enhancing privacy). No third party needs to be contacted, not even the smart contract. No public key infrastructure (PKI) needs to be maintained. And no revocation lists need to be checked. In contrast to competing smart contract approaches, ours is hierarchically managed (like a PKI) enabling better validation of attribute providers and making it more useful for large entities to provide identity services for their constituents (e.g., a government) while still enabling users to maintain a level of self-sovereignty.",

Multi-factor authentication schemes address some of the weaknesses of the traditional login process, but generally have deployability issues or degrade usability even further as they assume users do not possess adequate hardware. This assumption no longer holds: smartphones with biometric sensors, cameras, short-range communication capabilities, and unlimited data plans have become ubiquitous.

    "abstract": "In a scenario where hotspot wireless networks are increasingly being used, and given the amount of sensitive information exchanged on Internet interactions, there is the need to implement security mechanisms that guarantee data confidentiality and integrity in such networks, as well as the authenticity of the hotspot providers. However, many hotspots today use Captive Portals, which rely on authentication through Web pages (thus, an application-level authentication approach) instead of a link-layer approach. The consequence of this is that there is no security in the wireless link to the hotspot (it has to be provided at upper protocol layers), and is cumbersome to manage wireless access profiles (we need special applications or browsers' add-ons to do that). This work exposes the weaknesses of the Captive Portals' paradigm, which does not follow a unique nor standard approach, and describes a solution that intends to suppress them, based on the 802.1X architecture. This solution uses a new EAP-compliant protocol that is able to integrate an HTTP-based registration or authentication with a Captive Portal within the 802.1X authentication framework.",

    "abstract": "Mobile devices and technologies have become increasingly popular, offering comparable storage and computational capabilities to desktop computers allowing users to store and interact with sensitive and private information. The security and protection of such personal information are becoming more and more important since mobile devices are vulnerable to unauthorized access or theft. User authentication is a task of paramount importance that grants access to legitimate users at the point-of-entry and continuously through the usage session. This task is made possible with today's smartphones' embedded sensors that enable continuous and implicit user authentication by capturing behavioral biometrics and traits. In this paper, we survey more than 140 recent behavioral biometric-based approaches for continuous user authentication, including motion-based methods (28 studies), gait-based methods (19 studies), keystroke dynamics-based methods (20 studies), touch gesture-based methods (29 studies), voice-based methods (16 studies), and multimodal-based methods (34 studies). The survey provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art approaches for continuous user authentication using behavioral biometrics captured by smartphones' embedded sensors, including insights and open challenges for adoption, usability, and performance.",

Modern approaches to biometric authentication, based on sophisticated machine learning techniques, cannot avoid storing either trained-classifier details or explicit user biometric data, thus exposing users' credentials to falsification. In this paper, we introduce a secure way to handle user-specific information involved with the use of vector-space classifiers or artificial neural networks for biometric authentication. Our proposed architecture, called a Neural Fuzzy Extractor (NFE), allows the coupling of pre-existing classifiers with fuzzy extractors, through a artificial-neural-network-based buffer called an expander, with minimal or no performance degradation. The NFE thus offers all the performance advantages of modern deep-learning-based classifiers, and all the security of standard fuzzy extractors. We demonstrate the NFE retrofit to a classic artificial neural network for a simple scenario of fingerprint-based user authentication.",

Due to weak authentication mechanisms, unauthorized persons are invading Zoom sessions and creating disturbances (known as Zoom bombing). In this paper, we propose a preliminary work towards a seamless authentication mechanism for Zoom-based teaching and meeting. Our method is based on PRNU (Photo Response Non Uniformity)-based camera authentication, which can authenticate the camera of a device used in a Zoom meeting without requiring any assistance from the participants (e.g., needing the participant to provide biometric).

This work analyzes the use of received channel state information from the wireless environment and demonstrates the employment of a generative adversarial neural network (GAN) trained with received channel data to authenticate a transmitting device. We compared a variety of machine learning techniques and found that the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm reached 100% accuracy at lower signal to noise ratios (SNR) than other algorithms. However, before LOF reached 100%, we also show that the GAN was more accurate at lower SNR levels.",

    "abstract": "Implicit authentication (IA) is gaining popularity over recent years due to its use of user behavior as the main input, relieving users from explicit actions such as remembering and entering passwords. Various IA schemes have been proposed based on different behavioral and contextual features such as gait, touch, and GPS. However, existing IA schemes suffer from false positives, i.e., falsely accepting an adversary, and false negatives, i.e., falsely rejecting the legitimate user, more so than the more mature explicit authentication counterpart, due to users' behavior change. To deal with this problem, we propose BubbleMap (BMap), a framework that can be seamlessly incorporated into any existing IA system to balance between security (reducing false positives) and usability (reducing false negatives) as well as improving authentication accuracy. To evaluate the proposed framework, we implemented BMap on four state-of-the-art IA systems. We also conducted a comprehensive experiment in a real-world environment spanned two years and eight months. Most of the experimental results show that BMap can greatly enhance the IA schemes' performances in terms of authentication accuracy, security and usability, with a small amount of penalty on energy consumption.",

We propose a novel approach to authentication in which communicating parties are viewed as autonomous agents which interact repeatedly using their private decision models. The security of this approach rests upon the difficulty of learning the model parameters of interacting agents, a problem which we conjecture is also hard for quantum computing. We develop methods which enable a server agent to classify a client agent as either legitimate or adversarial based on their past interactions. Moreover, we use reinforcement learning techniques to train server policies which effectively probe the client's decisions to achieve more sample-efficient authentication, while making modelling attacks as difficult as possible via entropy-maximization principles. We empirically validate our methods for authenticating legitimate users while detecting different types of adversarial attacks.",

First, using a sample collection of authentication advice, we observe that different organizations' advice is often contradictory and at odds with current research. We highlight the difficulties organizations and users have when determining which advice is worth following. Consequently, we develop a model for identifying costs of advice. Our model incorporates factors that affect organizations and users, including, for example, usability aspects. Similarly, we model the security benefits brought by such advice. We then apply these models to our taxonomy of advice to indicate the potential effectiveness of the security recommendations. We find that organizations experience fewer costs than users as a result of authentication policies. Reassuringly, the advice our model has classified as good or bad, is in line with the NIST 2017 digital authentication guidelines.",

A profile of how a user performs transactions is built overtime and is used to analyse the risk level of each new transaction. If a transaction is flagged as high risk, we generate n-factor layers of authentication using past endorsed blockchain transactions. A demonstration of how we used the proposed approach to authenticate critical financial transactions in a blockchain-based asset financing platform is also discussed.",

In this paper, we focus on short blocklengths and propose a complete, fast, multi-factor authentication protocol that uniquely combines PUFs, proximity estimation and SKG. To demonstrate the performance of the SKG scheme in the short blocklength (with a focus on delay constrained applications), we provide a numerical comparison of three families of channel codes, including low density parity check codes (LDPC), Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem (BCH), and, Polar codes. The SKG keys are incorporated in a zero-round-trip-time resumption protocol for fast re-authentication. All schemes of the proposed mutual authentication protocol are shown to be secure through formal proofs using Burrows, Abadi and Needham (BAN) and Mao and Boyd (MB) logic as well as the Tamarin-prover.",

Keystroke authentication, as part of multi factor authentication, can be used in remote display access to guarantee the security of use of remote connectivity systems during the access control phase or throughout the session. This paper investigates how network conditions and additional host interaction may impact the behavioural pattern of keystrokes when used in a remote desktop application scenario. We focus on the timing of adjacent keys and investigate this impact by calculating the variations of the Euclidean distance between a reference profile and resulting profiles following such impairments. The experimental results indicate that variations of congestion latency, whether produced by adjacent traffic sources or by additional remote desktop interactions, have a substantive impact on the Euclidian distance, which in turn may affect the effectiveness of the biometric authentication algorithm. Results also indicate that data flows within remote desktop protocol are not prioritized and therefore additional traffic will have a significant impact on the keystroke timings, which renders continuous authentication less effective for remote access and more appropriate for one-time login.",

Until recently, the considered adversaries were assumed to use quantum computers and behave like classical adversaries otherwise. A more conservative approach is to assume that also the communication between the honest parties and the adversary is (partly) quantum. We discuss several options to define secure encryption and authentication against these stronger adversaries who can carry out 'superposition attacks'. We re-prove a recent result of Boneh and Zhandry, stating that a uniformly random function (and hence also a quantum-secure pseudorandom function) can serve as a message-authentication code which is secure, even if the adversary can evaluate this function in superposition.",

The algorithm used here is an adjusted union of the concepts which underlie projective geometry and group structure on circles. The authentication is done through a key, which iterates over the complete message string to produce the signature. The iteration is not only based on the frequency distribution of the message string alphabet, but also on the probability of occurrence of another given reference string in the message. The complete process can be easily computed in a small time, producing signatures which are highly dependent on the message string. Consequently, the odds in favor of existence of a forgery are highly reduced.",

In this paper, a game theoretic approach is proposed to quantitatively analyze the attacking strategies of the attacker who chooses one relay to attack so as to make rational decision on relay selection and extent of applying authentication protocols, which reaches the trade-off between system security requirement and quality of service (QoS) in wireless cooperative communication networks.",

The authentication of information can pose special problems (especially man-in-the-middle attacks), and is often wrapped up with authenticating identity. Literary can involve imitating the style of a famous author. If an original manuscript, typewritten text, or recording is available, then the medium itself (or its packaging - anything from a box to e-mail headers) can help prove or disprove the authenticity of the document. The use of digital images of handwritten historical documents has become more popular in recent years. Volunteers around the world now read thousands of these images as part of their indexing process. Handwritten text images of old documents are sometimes difficult to read or noisy due to the preservation of the document and quality of the image [1].

In this paper, we will focus on the password based authentication between a smart card owner and smart card via an untrusted card reader. In a typical scenario, a smart card owner inserts the smart card into an untrusted card reader and input the password via the card reader in order for the smart card to carry out the process of authentication with a remote server. In this case, we want to guarantee that the card reader will not be able to impersonate the card owner in future without the smart card itself. Furthermore, the smart card could be stolen. If this happens, we want the assurance that an adversary could not use the smart card to impersonate the card owner even though the sample space of passwords may be small enough to be enumerated by an off-line adversary.

However, for successful deployment, security and efficiency of content delivery must be provided at first. This paper presents a new approach for secure multicast in wireless networks. This approach, CRAW (Combination of Re-keying and Authentication in Wireless networks) combines member authentication procedure with group key management protocol to provide an efficient group re-keying process. One-time password is proposed for member authentication and CKC (Code for Key Calculation) is suggested for group key management in wireless networks. In fact, the combination of authentication with group key management in wireless networks results in a simple and secure mechanism both for authentication and group key management while mobile members join/leave a group or move inter-area. Simulation results show that CRAW reduces re-keying overhead at join from O(log2 n+1) to O(1) while security requirements are saved. Also, CRAW introduces storing a main list to manage mobile members' location while they move intra-group inter-area.",

    "abstract": "In this paper a novel data embedding technique in frequency domain has been proposed using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for image authentication and secured message transmission based on hiding a large volume of data into gray images. Image authentication is done by embedding message or image in frequency domain by choosing image blocks of size 2 x 2, called mask, from the source image in row major order and transform it into the frequency domain using DFT. Three bits of authenticating message/image/message-digest are fabricated within the real parts of each source image byte except first frequency component of each mask. The dimension of authenticating image followed by message digest (MD) and the content of authenticating message/image are also embedded. Inverse DFT (IDFT) is performed on embedded data to transform embedded frequency component to spatial component. In order to keep the quantum value positive and non negative in spatial domain a strong and robust technique is incorporated mainly on the first frequency component and sometimes on other component depends upon situations. The decoding is done by applying the reverse algorithm. Experimental results conform that the proposed algorithm performs better than DCT, QFT and SCDFT schemes.",

    "abstract": "Two-factor authentication (2F) aims to enhance resilience of password-based authentication by requiring users to provide an additional authentication factor, e.g., a code generated by a security token. However, it also introduces non-negligible costs for service providers and requires users to carry out additional actions during the authentication process. In this paper, we present an exploratory comparative study of the usability of 2F technologies. First, we conduct a pre-study interview to identify popular technologies as well as contexts and motivations in which they are used. We then present the results of a quantitative study based on a survey completed by 219 Mechanical Turk users, aiming to measure the usability of three popular 2F solutions: codes generated by security tokens, one-time PINs received via email or SMS, and dedicated smartphone apps (e.g., Google Authenticator). We record contexts and motivations, and study their impact on perceived usability. We find that 2F technologies are overall perceived as usable, regardless of motivation and/or context of use. We also present an exploratory factor analysis, highlighting that three metrics -- ease-of-use, required cognitive efforts, and trustworthiness -- are enough to capture key factors affecting 2F usability.",

    "abstract": "Advancement in communication technology provides a scalable platform for various services where a remote user can access the server from anywhere without moving from its place. It has provided a unique opportunity for online services, such that the user need not physically present at the service center. These services adopt authentication and key agreement protocols to ensure authorized and secure access to resources. Most of the authentication schemes support single server environment where the user has to register with each server. If a user wishes to access multiple application servers, he requires to register with each of the servers. Although multi-server authentication schemes introduced a scalable platform such that a user can interact with any server using single registration. Recently, Chuang and Chen proposed an efficient multi-server authenticated key agreement scheme based on smart cards along with password and biometrics. This is a lightweight authentication scheme which requires the computation of only hash function. In this article, we present a brief review of Chuang and Chen's scheme. We analyze Chuang and Chen's scheme and identify that their scheme does not resist stolen smart card attack which causes the user's impersonation attack, server spoofing attack and man-in-the middle attack. Additionally, we show that their scheme has a weak key agreement protocol, which does not ensure forward secrecy.",

The purpose of the identity theft is to facilitate the intellectual property theft. Without it the intellectual property theft would be obvious and the products would be confiscated and destroyed. Authentication solutions, to prevent identity theft, were then developed for the two categories of manufactured goods i.e. goods which can be subjected to destructive screening strategies and goods which cannot e.g. pharmaceutical drugs and currencies, respectively. The solutions developed were found to be analogous to digital signatures. Tamper proof packaging on pharmaceutical drugs is analogous to encryption because it prevents Mallory from interfering with the product. Breaking the tamper proof packaging is a one-way function. Concealed inside the packaging a one-time password, which can be used to authenticate the product over the internet. The name of the authentication website must be common knowledge, just like a public key for authenticating digital signatures. Otherwise the counterfeiters will specify their own authentication website. This solution can be altered for currencies i.e. the one-way function, equivalent to opening the tamper proof packaging, becomes the method of manufacture of the currency.",

The security problems related to these appliances have become a primary concern for both users and researchers. In this paper, we analyse first-person-view videos to develop a personalized user authentication mechanism. Our proposed algorithm generates provisional image-based passwords which benefit a variety of purposes such as unlocking a mobile device or fallback authentication. First, representative frames are extracted from the egocentric videos. Then, they are split into distinguishable segments before a clustering procedure is applied to discard repetitive scenes. The whole process aims to retain memorable images to form the authentication challenges. We integrate eye tracking data to select informative sequences of video frames and suggest a blurriness-based method if an eye-facing camera is not available. To evaluate our system, we perform experiments in different settings including object-interaction activities and traveling contexts. Even though our mechanism produces variable graphical passwords, the log-in effort for the user is comparable with approaches based on static challenges. We verified the authentication challenges in the presence of a random and an informed attacker who is familiar with the environment and observed that the time required and the number of attempts are significantly higher than for the legitimate user, making it possible to detect attacks on the authentication system.",

    "abstract": "Road network is employed for exchanging the information among the vehicles where accidents and traffic information can be delivered, or receive services by an infrastructure. Although wireless communication systems yield an efficient traffic system and provide ease to the drivers, there is a chance of a traffic disturbance and risk to drivers through malicious information. So, there should be examined a way to limit the chance of an intermediate attack. This paper presents an efficient user based authentication protocol for location based services to secure address configuration for IPv6-based mix-zones over the road network. This protocol authenticates to inspect vehicles actions confidentially and have the following characteristics (1) Anonymous authentication: a message issuer can be authenticated. (2) Privacy: Communication content is confidential. The cost must be reduced through the address configuration scheme to improve the scalability. (3) Efficiency: it attains quick message verification, low storage requirements, and in case of a dispute, provides cost efficient identity tracking. Vehicles movement, the variation of velocity and distance are considered to maintain as many common users as possible by reducing the cost. The performance evaluation and cost analysis show that our framework can reduce the cost and gain outperformed results. This model can achieve reliability and efficiency with packet rate information. This user authenticated key establishment protocol has comparatively shorter time response, diminishes cost, less packet loss information and enhanced privacy preservation against malicious attacks compared with existing methods.",

As opposed to existing approaches, our system supports a fully flexible user input such as free-form gestures, multi-touch, and arbitrary amount of strokes. Our experiments confirm that this approach provides a high level of robustness and security. More precisely, in 77% of all our test cases over all gestures considered, a user has been correctly identified during the first authentication attempt and in 99% after the third attempt, while an attacker has been detected in 97% of all test cases. As an example, gestures that have a good balance between complexity and usability, e.g., drawing a two parallel lines using two fingers at the same time, 100% success rate after three login attempts and 97% impostor detection rate were given. We stress that we consider the strongest possible attacker model: an attacker is not only allowed to monitor the legitimate user during the authentication process, but also receives additional information on the biometric properties, for example pressure, speed, rotation, and acceleration. We see this method as a significant step beyond existing authentication methods that can be deployed directly to devices in use without the need of additional hardware.",

Shoulder-surfing is an act of spying when an authorized user is logging into a system, and is promoted by a malicious intent of gaining unauthorized access. We present a gaze-assisted user authentication system as a potential solution to counter shoulder-surfing attacks. The system comprises of an eye tracker and an authentication interface with 12 pre-defined shapes (e.g., triangle, circle, etc.) that move simultaneously on the screen. A user chooses a set of three shapes as a password. To authenticate, the user follows the paths of three shapes as they move, one on each frame, over three consecutive frames. The system uses either the template matching or decision tree algorithms to match the scan-path of the user's gaze with the path traversed by the shape. The system was evaluated with seven users to test the accuracy of both the algorithms. We found that with the template matching algorithm the system achieves an accuracy of 95%, and with the decision tree algorithm an accuracy of 90.2%. We also present the advantages and disadvantages of using both the algorithms. Our study suggests that gaze-based authentication is a highly secure method against shoulder-surfing attacks as the unique pattern of eye movements for each individual makes the system hard to break into.",

Access control on mobile devices is therefore highly important. The widely accepted solution is to protect access by asking for a password. However, password authentication is tedious, e.g., a user needs to input a password every time she wants to use the device. Moreover, existing biometrics such as face, fingerprint, and touch behaviors are vulnerable to forgery attacks. We propose a new touch-based biometric authentication system that is passive and secure against forgery attacks. In our touch-based authentication, a user's touch behaviors are a function of some random \"secret\". The user can subconsciously know the secret while touching the device's screen. However, an attacker cannot know the secret at the time of attack, which makes it challenging to perform forgery attacks even if the attacker has already obtained the user's touch behaviors. We evaluate our touch-based authentication system by collecting data from 25 subjects. Results are promising: the random secrets do not influence user experience and, for targeted forgery attacks, our system achieves 0.18 smaller Equal Error Rates (EERs) than previous touch-based authentication.",

A quick and familiar user action of snapping a photo is sufficient for Pixie to simultaneously perform a graphical password authentication and a physical token based authentication, yet it does not require any expensive, uncommon hardware. Pixie establishes trust based on both the knowledge and possession of an arbitrary physical object readily accessible to the user, called trinket. Users choose their trinkets similar to setting a password, and authenticate by presenting the same trinket to the camera. The fact that the object is the trinket, is secret to the user. Pixie extracts robust, novel features from trinket images, and leverages a supervised learning classifier to effectively address inconsistencies between images of the same trinket captured in different circumstances. Pixie achieved a false accept rate below 0.09% in a brute force attack with 14.3 million authentication attempts, generated with 40,000 trinket images that we captured and collected from public datasets. We identify master images, that match multiple trinkets, and study techniques to reduce their impact. In a user study with 42 participants over 8 days in 3 sessions we found that Pixie outperforms text based passwords on memorability, speed, and user preference. Furthermore, Pixie was easily discoverable by new users and accurate under field use. Users were able to remember their trinkets 2 and 7 days after registering them, without any practice between the 3 test dates.",

    "abstract": "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is an internetworking paradigm that offers an alternative to today's IP-based Internet Architecture. Instead of focusing on hosts and their locations, CCN emphasizes addressable named content. By decoupling content from its location, CCN allows opportunistic in-network content caching, thus enabling better network utilization, at least for scalable content distribution. However, in order to be considered seriously, CCN must support basic security services, including content authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, authorization and access control. Current approaches rely on content producers to perform authorization and access control. This general approach has several disadvantages. First, consumer privacy vis-a-vis producers is not preserved. Second, identity management and access control impose high computational overhead on producers. Also, unnecessary repeated authentication and access control decisions must be made for each content request. These issues motivate our design of KRB-CCN - a complete authorization and access control system for private CCNs. Inspired by Kerberos in IP-based networks, KRB-CCN involves distinct authentication and authorization authorities. By doing so, KRB-CCN obviates the need for producers to make consumer authentication and access control decisions. KRB-CCN preserves consumer privacy since producers are unaware of consumer identities. Producers are also not required to keep any hard state and only need to perform two symmetric key operations to guarantee that sensitive content is confidentially delivered only to authenticated and authorized consumers. Most importantly, unlike prior designs, KRB-CCN leaves the network (i.e., CCN routers) out of any authorization, access control or confidentiality issues. We describe KRB-CCN design and implementation, analyze its security, and report on its performance.",

    "abstract": "From the viewpoint of physical-layer authentication, spoofing attacks can be foiled by checking channel state information (CSI). Existing CSI-based authentication algorithms mostly require a deep knowledge of the channel to deliver decent performance. In this paper, we investigate CSI-based authenticators that can spare the effort to predetermine channel properties by utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs). We first propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-enabled authenticator that is able to extract the local features in CSI. Next, we employ the recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the dependencies between different frequencies in CSI. In addition, we propose to use the convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN)---a combination of the CNN and the RNN---to learn local and contextual information in CSI for user authentication. To effectively train these DNNs, one needs a large amount of labeled channel records. However, it is often expensive to label large channel observations in the presence of a spoofer. In view of this, we further study a case in which only a small part of the the channel observations are labeled. To handle it, we extend these DNNs-enabled approaches into semi-supervised ones. This extension is based on a semi-supervised learning technique that employs both the labeled and unlabeled data to train a DNN. To be specific, our semi-supervised method begins by generating pseudo labels for the unlabeled channel samples through implementing the K-means algorithm in a semi-supervised manner. Subsequently, both the labeled and pseudo labeled data are exploited to pre-train a DNN, which is then fine-tuned based on the labeled channel records.",

We have witnessed many attacks on users and providers, which have resulted in significant financial losses. To remedy these issues, several wallet solutions have been proposed. However, these solutions often lack either essential security features, usability, or do not allow users to customize their spending rules. In this paper, we propose SmartOTPs, a smart-contract wallet framework that gives a flexible, usable, and secure way of managing crypto-tokens in a self-sovereign fashion. The proposed framework consists of four components (i.e., an authenticator, a client, a hardware wallet, and a smart contract), and it provides 2-factor authentication (2FA) performed in two stages of interaction with the blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first one that utilizes one-time passwords (OTPs) in the setting of the public blockchain. In SmartOTPs, the OTPs are aggregated by a Merkle tree and hash chains whereby for each authentication only a short OTP (e.g., 16B-long) is transferred from the authenticator to the client. Such a novel setting enables us to make a fully air-gapped authenticator by utilizing small QR codes or a few mnemonic words, while additionally offering resilience against quantum cryptanalysis. We have made a proof-of-concept based on the Ethereum platform. Our cost analysis shows that the average cost of a transfer operation is comparable to existing 2FA solutions using smart contracts with multi-signatures.",

Despite high accuracy, these approaches lack the stability in authentication when the users rotate in their positions. This is due to a significant change in CSI when a user rotates which mislead the authenticator when it compares the new CSI with the previous ones. Our approach presents a way of extracting features from raw CSI measurements which are stable towards rotation. We extract these features by the means of a deep neural network.

    "abstract": "Business analytics processes are often composed from orchestrated, collaborating services, which are consumed by users from multiple cloud systems (in different security realms), which need to be engaged dynamically at runtime. If heterogeneous cloud systems located in different security realms do not have direct authentication relationships, then it is a considerable technical challenge to enable secure collaboration. In order to address this security challenge, a new authentication framework is required to establish trust amongst business analytics service instances and users by distributing a common session secret to all participants of a session. We address this challenge by designing and implementing a secure multiparty authentication framework for dynamic interaction, for the scenario where members of different security realms express a need to access orchestrated services. This novel framework exploits the relationship of trust between session members in different security realms, to enable a user to obtain security credentials that access cloud resources in a remote realm. The mechanism assists cloud session users to authenticate their session membership, thereby improving the performance of authentication processes within multiparty sessions. We see applicability of this framework beyond multiple cloud infrastructure, to that of any scenario where multiple security realms has the potential to exist, such as the emerging Internet of Things (IoT).",

In this paper, we present TACAN (Transmitter Authentication in CAN), which provides secure authentication of ECUs by exploiting the covert channels without introducing CAN protocol modifications or traffic overheads (i.e., no extra bits or messages are used). TACAN turns upside-down the originally malicious concept of covert channels and exploits it to build an effective defensive technique that facilitates transmitter authentication via a trusted Monitor Node. TACAN consists of three different covert channels for ECU authentication: 1) Inter-Arrival Time (IAT)-based, leveraging the IATs of CAN messages; 2) offset-based, exploiting the clock offsets of CAN messages; 3) Least Significant Bit (LSB)-based, concealing authentication messages into the LSBs of normal CAN data. We implement the covert channels on the University of Washington (UW) EcoCAR testbed and evaluate their performance through extensive experiments. We demonstrate the feasibility of TACAN, highlighting no traffic overheads and attesting the regular functionality of ECUs. In particular, the bit error ratios are within 0.1% and 0.42% for the IAT-based and offset-based covert channels, respectively. Furthermore, the bit error ratio of the LSB-based covert channel is equal to that of a normal CAN bus, which is 3.1x10^-7%.",

    "abstract": "Authenticated data storage on an untrusted platform is an important computing paradigm for cloud applications ranging from big-data outsourcing, to cryptocurrency and certificate transparency log. These modern applications increasingly feature update-intensive workloads, whereas existing authenticated data structures (ADSs) designed with in-place updates are inefficient to handle such workloads. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a novel authenticated log-structured merge tree (eLSM) based key-value store by leveraging Intel SGX enclaves. We present a system design that runs the code of eLSM store inside enclave. To circumvent the limited enclave memory (128 MB with the latest Intel CPUs), we propose to place the memory buffer of the eLSM store outside the enclave and protect the buffer using a new authenticated data structure by digesting individual LSM-tree levels. We design protocols to support query authentication in data integrity, completeness (under range queries), and freshness. The proof in our protocol is made small by including only the Merkle proofs at selective levels. We implement eLSM on top of Google LevelDB and Facebook RocksDB with minimal code change and performance interference. We evaluate the performance of eLSM under the YCSB workload benchmark and show a performance advantage of up to 4.5X speedup.",

    "abstract": "5G mobile networks provide additional benefits in terms of lower latency, higher data rates, and more coverage, in comparison to 4G networks, and they are also coming close to standardization. For example, 5G has a new level of data transfer and processing speed that assures users are not disconnected when they move from one cell to another; thus, supporting faster connection. However, it comes with its own technical challenges relating to resource management, authentication handover and user privacy protection. In 5G, the frequent displacement of the users among the cells as a result of repeated authentication handovers often lead to a delay, contradicting the 5G objectives. In this paper, we propose a new authentication approach that utilizes blockchain and software defined networking (SDN) techniques to remove the re-authentication in repeated handover among heterogeneous cells. The proposed approach is designed to assure the low delay, appropriate for the 5G network in which users can be replaced with the least delay among heterogeneous cells using their public and private keys provided by the devised blockchain component while protecting their privacy. In our comparison between Proof-of-Work (POW)-based and network-based models, the delay of our authentication handover was shown to be less than 1ms. Also, our approach demonstrated less signaling overhead and energy consumption compared to peer models.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the security of automotive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is facing urgent threats due to the widespread use of legacy in-vehicle communication systems. As a representative legacy bus system, the Controller Area Network (CAN) hosts Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that are crucial vehicle functioning. In this scenario, malicious actors can exploit CAN vulnerabilities, such as the lack of built-in authentication and encryption schemes, to launch CAN bus attacks with life-threatening consequences (e.g., disabling brakes). In this paper, we present TACAN (Transmitter Authentication in CAN), which provides secure authentication of ECUs on the legacy CAN bus by exploiting the covert channels, without introducing CAN protocol modifications or traffic overheads. TACAN turns upside-down the originally malicious concept of covert channels and exploits it to build an effective defensive technique that facilitates transmitter authentication via a centralized, trusted Monitor Node. TACAN consists of three different covert channels for ECU authentication: 1) the Inter-Arrival Time (IAT)-based; 2) the Least Significant Bit (LSB)-based; and 3) a hybrid covert channel, exploiting the combination of the first two. In order to validate TACAN, we implement the covert channels on the University of Washington (UW) EcoCAR (Chevrolet Camaro 2016) testbed. We further evaluate the bit error, throughput, and detection performance of TACAN through extensive experiments using the EcoCAR testbed and a publicly available dataset collected from Toyota Camry 2010. We demonstrate the feasibility of TACAN and the effectiveness of detecting CAN bus attacks, highlighting no traffic overheads and attesting the regular functionality of ECUs.",

    "abstract": "Remote attestation (RA) authenticates code running in trusted execution environments (TEEs), allow trusted code to be deployed even on untrusted hosts. However, trust relationships established by one component in a distributed application may impact the security of other components, making it difficult to reason about the security of the application as a whole. Furthermore, traditional RA approaches interact badly with modern web service design, which tends to employ small interacting microservices, short session lifetimes, and little or no state. This paper presents the Decent Application Platform, a framework for building secure decentralized applications. Decent applications authenticate and authorize distributed enclave components using a protocol based on self-attestation certificates, a reusable credential based on RA and verifiable by a third party. Components mutually authenticate each other not only based on their code, but also based on the other components they trust, ensuring that no transitively-connected components receive unauthorized information. While some other TEE frameworks support mutual authentication in some form, Decent is the only system that supports mutual authentication without requiring an additional trusted third party besides the trusted hardware's manufacturer. We have verified the secrecy and authenticity of Decent application data in ProVerif, and implemented two applications to evaluate Decent's expressiveness and performance: DecentRide, a ride-sharing service, and DecentHT, a distributed hash table. On the YCSB benchmark, we show that DecentHT achieves 7.5x higher throughput and 3.67x lower latency compared to a non-Decent implementation.",

    "abstract": "The security of private information is becoming the bedrock of an increasingly digitized society. While the users are flooded with passwords and PINs, these gold-standard explicit authentications are becoming less popular and valuable. Recent biometric-based authentication methods, such as facial or finger recognition, are getting popular due to their higher accuracy. However, these hard-biometric-based systems require dedicated devices with powerful sensors and authentication models, which are often limited to most of the market wearables. Still, market wearables are collecting various private information of a user and are becoming an integral part of life: accessing cars, bank accounts, etc. Therefore, time demands a burden-free implicit authentication mechanism for wearables using the less-informative soft-biometric data that are easily obtainable from modern market wearables. In this work, we present a context-dependent soft-biometric-based authentication system for wearables devices using heart rate, gait, and breathing audio signals. From our detailed analysis using the \"leave-one-out\" validation, we find that a lighter $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$-NN) model with $k = 2$ can obtain an average accuracy of $0.93 \\pm 0.06$, $F_1$ score $0.93 \\pm 0.03$, and {\\em false positive rate} (FPR) below $0.08$ at 50\\% level of confidence, which shows the promise of this work.",

    "abstract": "To send encrypted emails, users typically need to create and exchange keys which later should be manually authenticated, for instance, by comparing long strings of characters. These tasks are cumbersome for the average user. To make more accessible the use of encrypted email, a secure email application named pEp automates the key management operations; pEp still requires the users to carry out the verification, however, the authentication process is simple: users have to compare familiar words instead of strings of random characters, then the application shows the users what level of trust they have achieved via colored visual indicators. Yet, users may not execute the authentication ceremony as intended, pEp's trust rating may be wrongly assigned, or both. To learn whether pEp's trust ratings (and the corresponding visual indicators) are assigned consistently, we present a formal security analysis of pEp's authentication ceremony. From the software implementation in C, we derive the specifications of an abstract protocol for public key distribution, encryption and trust establishment; then, we model the protocol in a variant of the applied pi calculus and later formally verify and validate specific privacy and authentication properties. We also discuss alternative research directions that could enrich the analysis.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, commonly-used authentication systems for mobile device users, e.g. password checking, face recognition or fingerprint scanning, are susceptible to various kinds of attacks. In order to prevent some of the possible attacks, these explicit authentication systems can be enhanced by considering a two-factor authentication scheme, in which the second factor is an implicit authentication system based on analyzing motion sensor data captured by accelerometers or gyroscopes. In order to avoid any additional burdens to the user, the registration process of the implicit authentication system must be performed quickly, i.e. the number of data samples collected from the user is typically small. In the context of designing a machine learning model for implicit user authentication based on motion signals, data augmentation can play an important role. In this paper, we study several data augmentation techniques in the quest of finding useful augmentation methods for motion sensor data. We propose a set of four research questions related to data augmentation in the context of few-shot user identification based on motion sensor signals. We conduct experiments on a benchmark data set, using two deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks, showing which and when data augmentation methods bring accuracy improvements. Interestingly, we find that data augmentation is not very helpful, most likely because the signal patterns useful to discriminate users are too sensitive to the transformations brought by certain data augmentation techniques. This result is somewhat contradictory to the common belief that data augmentation is expected to increase the accuracy of machine learning models.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are expected to effectively create a stand-alone network for secure communication among autonomous agents. In such a dynamic and fast-changing network with high-speed agents, verifying the authenticity and integrity of messages while taking preventive action (e.g., applying brakes) within tens of milliseconds is one of the main challenges. In such a brief moment after receiving a message, the agent not only must verify the integrity and authenticity of the received message but also needs to perform extra computations to localize the sender of the message for taking appropriate action (e.g., an immediate stop warning from a vehicle in front vs. rear). In this paper, we present an inherently location-aware and lightweight authentication protocol by exploiting in situ visual localization (i.e., SLAM). In this protocol, each agent displays its public key using visual authentication beacons (e.g., QR codes). Thus, receiving agents not only can verify and authenticate the messages but also can easily localize the sender by keeping a shortlist of observed visual beacons within their visual localization system with no additional computation cost. Compared to prior work, our location-aware protocol is scalable, does not depend on any infrastructure, removes the high cost of post-message-delivery localization, and provides trustworthiness guarantees for information that are beyond the reach of each agent sensors.",

    "abstract": "Security in passive resource-constrained Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags is of much interest nowadays. Resistance against illegal tracking, cloning, timing, and replay attacks are necessary for a secure RFID authentication scheme. Reader authentication is also necessary to thwart any illegal attempt to read the tags. With an objective to design a secure and low-cost RFID authentication protocol, Gene Tsudik proposed a timestamp-based protocol using symmetric keys, named YA-TRAP*. Although YA-TRAP* achieves its target security properties, it is susceptible to timing attacks, where the timestamp to be sent by the reader to the tag can be freely selected by an adversary. Moreover, in YA-TRAP*, reader authentication is not provided, and a tag can become inoperative after exceeding its pre-stored threshold timestamp value. In this paper, we propose two mutual RFID authentication protocols that aim to improve YA-TRAP* by preventing timing attack, and by providing reader authentication. Also, a tag is allowed to refresh its pre-stored threshold value in our protocols, so that it does not become inoperative after exceeding the threshold. Our protocols also achieve other security properties like forward security, resistance against cloning, replay, and tracking attacks. Moreover, the computation and communication costs are kept as low as possible for the tags. It is important to keep the communication cost as low as possible when many tags are authenticated in batch-mode. By introducing aggregate function for the reader-to-server communication, the communication cost is reduced. We also discuss different possible applications of our protocols. Our protocols thus capture more security properties and more efficiency than YA-TRAP*. Finally, we show that our protocols can be implemented using the current standard low-cost RFID infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, mobile banking becomes a popular tool which consumers can conduct financial transactions such as shopping, monitoring accounts balance, transferring funds and other payments. Consumers dependency on mobile needs, make people take a little bit more interest in mobile banking. The use of the one-time password which is sent to the user mobile phone by short message service (SMS) is a vulnerability which we want to solve with proposing a new scheme called S-Mbank. We replace the authentication using the one-time password with the contactless smart card to prevent attackers to use the unencrypted message which is sent to the user's mobile phone. Moreover, it deals vulnerability of spoofer to send an SMS pretending as a bank's server. The contactless smart card is proposed because of its flexibility and security which easier to bring in our wallet than the common passcode generators. The replacement of SMS-based authentication with contactless smart card removes the vulnerability of unauthorized users to act as a legitimate user to exploit the mobile banking user's account. Besides that, we use public-private key pair and PIN to provide two factors authentication and mutual authentication. We use signcryption scheme to provide the efficiency of the computation. Pair based text authentication is also proposed for the login process as a solution to shoulder-surfing attack. We use Scyther tool to analyze the security of authentication protocol in S-Mbank scheme. From the proposed scheme, we are able to provide more security protection for mobile banking service.",

The resulting data structure, called an Authenticated Append-Only Skip List (AASL), allows its maintainers to produce one-way digests of the entire data sequence, which they can publish to others as a commitment on the contents and order of the sequence. The maintainer can produce efficiently succinct proofs that authenticate a particular datum in a particular position of the data sequence against a published digest. AASLs are secure against tampering even by malicious data structure maintainers. First, we show that a maintainer cannot ``invent'' and authenticate data elements for the AASL after he has committed to the structure. Second, he cannot equivocate by being able to prove conflicting facts about a particular position of the data sequence. This is the case even when the data sequence grows with time and its maintainer publishes successive commitments at times of his own choosing. AASLs can be invaluable in reasoning about the integrity of system logs maintained by untrusted components of a loosely-coupled distributed system.",

Yet, from a cryptographer's point of view, authentication is at least as important as a secure exchange of keys. Adding an authentication via hashing e.g. is straightforward but with no relation to Neural Cryptography. We consequently formulate an authenticated key exchange within this concept. Another alternative, integrating a Zero-Knowledge protocol into the synchronisation, is also presented. A Man-In-The-Middle attack and even all currently known attacks, that are based on using identically structured TPMs and synchronisation as well, can so be averted. This in turn has practical consequences on using the trajectory in weight space. Both suggestions have the advantage of not affecting the previously observed physics of this interacting system at all.",

We propose a security abstraction, inspired by earlier work on secure RPC, in which the methods exported by a web service are annotated with one of three security levels: none, authenticated, or both authenticated and encrypted. We model our abstraction as an object calculus with primitives for defining and calling web services. We describe the semantics of our object calculus by translating to a lower-level language with primitives for message passing and cryptography. To validate our semantics, we embed correspondence assertions that specify the correct authentication of requests and responses. By appeal to the type theory for cryptographic protocols of Gordon and Jeffrey's Cryptyc, we verify the correspondence assertions simply by typing. Finally, we describe an implementation of our semantics via custom SOAP headers.",

We show that a quantum encoding of secret bits offers more security than the classical XOR function introduced by Brassard. Furthermore, we establish the relationship between the bias of a PRG and the amount of information about the key that the attacker can retrieve from a block of authenticated messages. Finally, we prove that quantum resources can improve both the secrecy of the key generated by the PRG and the secrecy of the tag obtained with a hidden hash function.",

Moreover, since the underlying computations in HB protocols are very efficient, our protocol also reduces reader load compared to PRF-based protocols. We suggest a tree-based approach that replaces the PRF-based authentication from prior work with a procedure such as HB+ or HB#. We optimize the tree- traversal stage through usage of a \"light version\" of the underlying protocol and shared random challenges across all levels of the tree. This provides significant reduction of the communication resources, resulting in a privacy-preserving protocol almost as efficient as the underlying HB+ or HB#",

The first layer embedded in spatial domain verifies authenticity and the second layer embedded in transform domain provides reversibility. This technique utilizes selective LSB embedding and histogram characteristics of the difference images of the wavelet coefficients and modifies pixel values slightly to embed the watermark.

    "abstract": "In the splitting model, information theoretic authentication codes allow non-deterministic encoding, that is, several messages can be used to communicate a particular plaintext. Certain applications require that the aspect of secrecy should hold simultaneously. Ogata-Kurosawa-Stinson-Saido (2004) have constructed optimal splitting authentication codes achieving perfect secrecy for the special case when the number of keys equals the number of messages. In this paper, we establish a construction method for optimal splitting authentication codes with perfect secrecy in the more general case when the number of keys may differ from the number of messages. To the best knowledge, this is the first result of this type.",

    "abstract": "The design of authentication protocols, for online banking services in particular and any service that is of sensitive nature in general, is quite challenging. Indeed, enforcing security guarantees has overhead thus imposing additional computation and design considerations that do not always meet usability and user requirements. On the other hand, relaxing assumptions and rigorous security design to improve the user experience can lead to security breaches that can harm the users' trust in the system. In this paper, we demonstrate how careful visualization design can enhance not only the security but also the usability of the authentication process. To that end, we propose a family of visualized authentication protocols, a visualized transaction verification, and a \"decryptable to your eyes only\" protocol. Through rigorous analysis, we verify that our protocols are immune to many of the challenging authentication attacks applicable in the literature. Furthermore, using an extensive case study on a prototype of our protocols, we highlight the potential of our approach for real-world deployment: we were able to achieve a high level of usability while satisfying stringent security requirements.",

    "abstract": "In todays world of technology and gadgets almost every person is having a portable device, be it a laptop or the smart phones. The user would like to have all the services at his fingertips and access them through the portable device he owns. Maybe he wants some data from the fellow user or from the service provider or maybe he wants to control his smart devices at home from wherever he is. In the present era of mobile environments, interactions between the user device and the service provider must be secure enough regardless of the type of device used to access or utilize the services. In this paper we propose a \"Secure Three Way Authentication (STWA)\" technique intended to preserve the user privacy and to accomplish ownership authentication in order to securely deliver the services to the user devices. This technique will also help the users or the service providers to check if the device is compromised or not with the help of the encrypted pass-phrases that are being exchanged.",

    "abstract": "Group communication can benefit from Internet Protocol (IP) multicast protocol to achieve efficient exchange of messages. However, IP multicast does not provide any mechanisms for authentication. In literature, many solutions to solve this problem were presented. It has been shown that Wong and Lam protocol is the only protocol that can resist both packet loss and pollution attacks. In contrast, it has high computation and communication overheads. In the present paper, an efficient design for the implementation of Wong and Lam multicast authentication protocol is proposed. In order to solve the computation overhead problem, we use two-levels of parallelism. To reduce the communication overhead, we use Universal Message Authentication Codes (UMAC) instead of hash functions. The design is analyzed for both NTRU and elliptic curve cryptography signature algorithms. The analysis shows that the proposed design decreases significantly the execution time of Wong-Lam protocol which makes it suitable for real-time applications.",

Several approaches have been developed to deal with this problem, but they have significant usability drawbacks, usually in the time and effort to log in, making them less suitable for authentication [4, 8]. For example, it is time-consuming for users to log in CHC [4] and there are complex text memory requirements in scheme proposed by Hong [5]. With respect to the scheme proposed by Weinshall [6], not only is it intricate to log in, but also the main claim of resisting shoulder-surfing is proven false [7].

Origin authentication already does much to improve routing security. Moreover, the transition to S*BGP is expected to be long and slow, with S*BGP coexisting in \"partial deployment\" alongside BGP for a long time. We therefore use theoretical and experimental approach to study the security benefits provided by partially-deployed S*BGP, vis-a-vis those already provided by origin authentication. Because routing policies have a profound impact on routing security, we use a survey of 100 network operators to find the policies that are likely to be most popular during partial S*BGP deployment. We find that S*BGP provides only meagre benefits over origin authentication when these popular policies are used. We also study the security benefits of other routing policies, provide prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S*BGP, and show how interactions between S*BGP and BGP can introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system.",

The originality of our work comes from the fact that we exploit a fixed key to increase the throughput. It leads us to implement GPS using the Chapman constant multiplier. This parallel implementation is 40 times faster but 10 times bigger than the reference serial one. We propose to serialize this multiplier to reduce its area at the cost of lower throughput. Our hybrid Chapman's multiplier is 8 times faster but only twice bigger than the reference. Results presented here allow designers to adapt the performance of GPS authentication to their hardware resources.

A user can access remote medical servers using internet without moving from his place. Although remote user and server exchange their messages/data via public networks. An adversary is considered to be enough powerful that he may have full control over the public network. This makes these Telecare services vulnerable to attacks. To ensure secure communication between the user and server many password based authentication schemes have been proposed. In 2013, Hao et al. presented chaotic maps-based password authentication scheme for TMIS. Recently, Lee identified that Hao et al.'s scheme fails to satisfy key agreement property, such that a malicious server can predetermine the session key. Lee also presented an efficient chaotic map-based password authentication and key agreement scheme using Smart cards for TMIS. In this article, we briefly review Lee's scheme and demonstrates the weakness of Lee's scheme. The study shows that the Lee's scheme inefficiency of password change phase causes denial of service attack and login phase results extra computation and communication overhead.",

The correlation among packets makes them vulnerable to packet loss, which is inherent in the Internet and wireless networks. Moreover, the lack of Denial of Service (DoS) resilience renders most of them vulnerable to packet injection in hostile environments. In this paper, we propose a novel multicast authentication protocol, namely MABS, including two schemes. The basic scheme (MABS-B) eliminates the correlation among packets and thus provides the perfect resilience to packet loss, and it is also efficient in terms of latency, computation, and communication overhead due to an efficient cryptographic primitive called batch signature, which supports the authentication of any number of packets simultaneously.so we discuss their comparisons and performance evaluation of Packet Loss, Comparisons over Lossy Channels, Comparisons of Signature Schemes, computationational overheads etc.",

To support a quick and lightweight deployment, our solution automatically switches from training mode to deployment mode when the user's behaviour is sufficiently learned. Furthermore, it allows the device to automatically determine a suitable detection threshold. We use our model to investigate practical aspects of sensor-based authentication by applying it to three publicly available data sets, computing expected times for training duration and behaviour drift.

Accordingly, two encryption procedures have been established in an independent middleware (Agent) to perform the process of user authentication, access control, and data protection in cloud servers. AES has been used as a symmetric cryptography algorithm in cloud servers and RSA has been used as an asymmetric cryptography algorithm in Agent servers. The theoretical evaluation of the proposed model shows that the ability of resistance in face with possible attacks and unpredictable events has been enhanced considerably in comparison with similar models because of using dual encryption and an independent middleware during user authentication and data protection procedures.",

They are (1) easily shared, (2) trivial to observe and (3) maddeningly elusive when forgotten. While alternatives to passwords have been proposed, none, as yet, have been adopted widely. There seems to be a reluctance to switch from tried and tested passwords to novel alternatives, even if the most glaring flaws of passwords can be mitigated. One argument is that there is not enough investigation into the feasibility of many password alternatives. Graphical authentication mechanisms are a case in point. Therefore, in this paper, we detail the design of two prototype applications that utilise graphical authentication mechanisms. However, when forced to consider the design of such prototypes, we find that pertinent password problems eg. observation of entry, are just that: password problems. We conclude that effective, alternative authentication mechanisms should target authentication scenarios rather than the well-known problems of passwords. This is the only route to wide-spread adoption of alternatives.",

Methods are based on the color properties of bee pollen loads images and the use of one-class classifiers which are appropriate to reject unknown pollen samples when there is limited data about them. The validation of the method is carried out by authenticating Spanish bee pollen types. Experimentation shows that the proposed methods can obtain an overall authentication accuracy of 94%.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the authentication problem where a candidate measurement presented by an unidentified user is compared to a previously stored measurement of the legitimate user, the enrollment, with respect to a certain distortion criteria for authentication. An adversary wishes to impersonate the legitimate user by guessing the enrollment until the system authenticates him. For this setting, we study the minimum number of required guesses (on average) by the adversary for a successful impersonation attack and find the complete characterization of the asymptotic exponent of this metric, referred to as the deception exponent. Our result is a direct application of the results of the Guessing problem by Arikan and Merhav [19]. Paralleling the work in [19] we also extend this result to the case where the adversary may have access to additional side information correlated to the enrollment data. The paper is a revised version of a submission to IEEE WIFS 2015, with the referencing to the paper [19] clarified compared with the conference version.",

    "abstract": "Hash-based message authentication codes are an extremely simple yet hugely effective construction for producing keyed message digests using shared secrets. HMACs have seen widespread use as ad-hoc digital signatures in many Internet applications. While messages signed with an HMAC are secure against sender impersonation and tampering in transit, if used alone they are susceptible to replay attacks. We propose a construction that extends HMACs to produce a keyed message digest that has a finite validity period. We then propose a message signature scheme that uses this time-dependent MAC along with an unique message identifier to calculate a set of authentication factors using which a recipient can readily detect and ignore replayed messages, thus providing perfect resistance against replay attacks. We further analyse time-based message authentication codes and show that they provide stronger security guarantees than plain HMACs, even when used independently of the aforementioned replay attack resistant message signature scheme.",

    "abstract": "There is a great adventure of watermarking usage in the context of conventional authentication since it does not require additional storage space for supplementary metadata. However JPEG compression, being a conventional method to compress images, leads to exact authentication breaking. We discuss a semi-fragile watermarking system for digital images tolerant to JPEG/JPEG2000 compression. Recently we have published a selective authentication method based on Zernike moments. But unfortunately it has large computational complexity and not sufficiently good detection of small image modifications. In the current paper it is proposed (in contrast to Zernike moments approach) the usage of image finite differences and 3-bit quantization as the main technique. In order to embed a watermark (WM) into the image, some areas of the Haar wavelet transform coefficients are used. Simulation results show a good resistance of this method to JPEG compression with $\\mbox{\\rm CR}\\leq 30\\%$ (Compression Ratio), high probability of small image modification recognition, image quality assessments $\\mbox{\\rm PSNR}\\geq 40$ (Peak signal-to-noise ratio) dB and $\\mbox{\\rm SSIM}\\geq 0.98$ (Structural Similarity Index Measure) after embedding and lower computation complexity of WM embedding and extraction. All these properties qualify this approach as effective.",

We explain how SLV is compatible with the increasing trends of geographically distributed content dissemination over the Internet, without causing any new interoperability conflicts. Additionally, we introduce the notion of (verifiable) \"server location pinning\" within TLS (conceptually similar to certificate pinning) to support SLV, and evaluate their combined impact using a server-authentication evaluation framework. The results affirm the addition of new security benefits to the existing SSL/TLS-based authentication mechanisms. We implement SLV through a location verification service, the simplest version of which requires no server-side changes. We also implement a simple browser extension that interacts seamlessly with the verification infrastructure to obtain realtime server location-verification results.",

The crowdturfing industry employs large numbers of bots and human workers to manipulate OSM and misrepresent public opinion. The detection of online discussion topics manipulated by OSM \\emph{abusers} is an emerging issue attracting significant attention. In this paper, we propose an approach for quantifying the authenticity of online discussions based on the similarity of OSM accounts participating in the discussion to known abusers and legitimate accounts. Our method uses several similarity functions for the analysis and classification of OSM accounts. The proposed methods are demonstrated using Twitter data collected for this study and previously published \\emph{Arabic honeypot dataset}. The former includes manually labeled accounts and abusers who participated in crowdturfing platforms. Evaluation of the topic's authenticity, derived from account similarity functions, shows that the suggested approach is effective for discriminating between topics that were strongly promoted by abusers and topics that attracted authentic public interest.",

Since then, five formal executable specifications of the MAA (in LOTOS, LNT, and term rewrite systems) have been designed at INRIA Grenoble.

We found that users who focused on orienting themselves to position the first digit of the passcode using the tactile feedback performed better in the task.

We also prove that the number of recycled key bits is optimal for this family of protocols, i.e., there exists an adversarial strategy to obtain all non-recycled bits.

This scheme establishes a group between road-side unit (RSU) and vehicles by using self-authentication without certification authority, and enhances certification efficiency by using group key (GK) transmission method. At the same time, to avoid the attacker to attack the legal vehicle by RSU, we adopt deniable group key agreement method to negotiation session key (sk) and use it to transmit GK between RSU. In addition, vehicles not only broadcast messages to other vehicles, but also communicate with other members in the same group. So group communication is necessary in VANET. Finally, the security and performance analysis shown that our scheme is security, meanwhile the verification delay, transmission overheard and message delay are more efficient than other related schemes in authentication, transmission and communication.",

Using a victim's smartphone, the attacker can launch impersonation attacks, which threaten the security of the victim and other users in the network. Our threat model includes the attacker taking over the phone after the user has logged on with his password or pin. Our goal is to design a mechanism for smartphones to better authenticate the current user, continuously and implicitly, and raise alerts when necessary. In this paper, we propose a multi-sensors-based system to achieve continuous and implicit authentication for smartphone users. The system continuously learns the owner's behavior patterns and environment characteristics, and then authenticates the current user without interrupting user-smartphone interactions. Our method can adaptively update a user's model considering the temporal change of user's patterns. Experimental results show that our method is efficient, requiring less than 10 seconds to train the model and 20 seconds to detect the abnormal user, while achieving high accuracy (more than 90%). Also the combination of more sensors provide better accuracy. Furthermore, our method enables adjusting the security level by changing the sampling rate.",

In cryptographic approaches messages are signed with either an asymmetric or symmetric key, and a source of randomness is required to generate the key. In physical layer authentication (PLA) instead the receiver checks if received messages presumably coming from the same source undergo the same channel. We compare these solutions by considering the physical-layer channel features as randomness source for generating the key, thus allowing an immediate comparison with PLA (that already uses these features). For the symmetric-key approach we use secret key agreement, while for asymmetric-key the channel is used as entropy source at the transmitter. We focus on the asymptotic case of an infinite number of independent and identically distributed channel realizations, showing the correctness of all schemes and analyzing the secure authentication rate, that dictates the rate at which the probability that UA security is broken goes to zero as the number of used channel resources (to generate the key or for PLA) goes to infinity. Both passive and active attacks are considered and by numerical results we compare the various systems.",

For example, software attackers perform code injection and code-reuse attacks on their remote interfaces, and physical access to IoT devices allows to tamper with code in memory, steal confidential Intellectual Property (IP), or mount fault attacks to manipulate a CPU's control flow. In this work, we present Sponge-based Control Flow Protection (SCFP). SCFP is a stateful, sponge-based scheme to ensure the confidentiality of software IP and its authentic execution on IoT devices. At compile time, SCFP encrypts and authenticates software with instruction-level granularity. During execution, an SCFP hardware extension between the CPU's fetch and decode stage continuously decrypts and authenticates instructions. Sponge-based authenticated encryption in SCFP yields fine-grained control-flow integrity and thus prevents code-reuse, code-injection, and fault attacks on the code and the control flow. In addition, SCFP withstands any modification of software in memory. For evaluation, we extended a RISC-V core with SCFP and fabricated a real System on Chip (SoC). The average overhead in code size and execution time of SCFP on this design is 19.8% and 9.1%, respectively, and thus meets the requirements of embedded IoT devices.",

The particular innovation of our scheme is authentication can only occur between a user and its designated verifier for a service, and the verification cannot be performed by any other verifier. The benefit of this authentication approach is that it prevents information leakage of a user's service access information, even if the verifiers for these services collude which each other. Our scheme also supports a trusted third party who is authorised to de-anonymise the user and reveal her whole services access information if required.

The idea behind Internet of things is the interconnection of internet enabled things or devices to each other and to humans, to achieve some common goals. In near future IoT is expected to be seamlessly integrated into our environment and human will be wholly solely dependent on this technology for comfort and easy life style. Any security compromise of the system will directly affect human life. Therefore security and privacy of this technology is foremost important issue to resolve. In this paper we present a thorough study of security problems in IoT and classify possible cyberattacks on each layer of IoT architecture. We also discuss challenges to traditional security solutions such as cryptographic solutions, authentication mechanisms and key management in IoT. Device authentication and access controls is an essential area of IoT security, which is not surveyed so far. We spent our efforts to bring the state of the art device authentication and access control techniques on a single paper.",

    "abstract": "With the development of artificial intelligence and self-driving, vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) has become an irreplaceable part of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). However, the traditional network of the ground cannot meet the requirements of transmission, processing, and storage among vehicles. Under this circumstance, integrating space and air nodes into the whole network can provide comprehensive traffic information and reduce the transmission delay. The high mobility and low latency in the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) put forward higher requirements for security issues such as identity authentication, privacy protection, and data security. This paper simplifies the Blockchain and proposes an identity authentication and privacy protection scheme based on the Hashchain in the SAGIN. The scheme focuses on the characteristics of the wireless signal to identify and authenticate the nodes. The verification and backup of the records on the block are implemented with the distributed streaming platform, Kafka algorithm, instead of the consensus. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the security of this scheme. Afterward, the experimental results reveal the delay brought by the scheme using the simulation of SUMO, OMNeT++, and Veins.",

    "abstract": "Efficient authentication is vital for IoT applications with stringent minimum-delay requirements (e.g., energy delivery systems). This requirement becomes even more crucial when the IoT devices are battery-powered, like small aerial drones, and the efficiency of authentication directly translates to more operation time. Although some fast authentication techniques have been proposed, some of them might not fully meet the needs of the emerging delay-aware IoT. In this paper, we propose a new signature scheme called ARIS that pushes the limits of the existing digital signatures, wherein commodity hardware can verify 83,333 signatures per second. ARIS also enables the fastest signature generation along with the lowest energy consumption and end-to-end delay among its counterparts. These significant computational advantages come with a larger storage requirement, which is a highly favorable trade-off for some critical delay-aware applications. These desirable features are achieved by harnessing message encoding with cover-free families and special elliptic curve based one-way function. We prove the security of ARIS under the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem in the random oracle model. We provide an open-sourced implementation of ARIS on commodity hardware and 8-bit AVR microcontroller for public testing and verification.",

Shadow stacks record return addresses in integrity-protected memory secured with hardware-assistance or software access control. Software shadow stacks incur high overheads or trade off security for efficiency. Hardware-assisted shadow stacks are efficient and secure, but require the deployment of special-purpose hardware. We present authenticated call stack (ACS), an approach that uses chained message authentication codes (MACs). Our prototype, PACStack, uses the ARM general purpose hardware mechanism for pointer authentication (PA) to implement ACS. Via a rigorous security analysis, we show that PACStack achieves security comparable to hardware-assisted shadow stacks without requiring dedicated hardware. We demonstrate that PACStack's performance overhead is small (~3%).",

In this paper, we claim that traditional FIdM are mostly cumbersome and then ill-suited for IoT. As a solution to this problem, we come up with a federated identity authentication protocol exclusively tailored to IoT. Federated Lightweight Authentication of Things (FLAT), our solution, replaces weighty protocols and asymmetric cryptographic primitives used in traditional FIdM by lighter ones. For instance, FLAT synergistically combines symmetric cryptosystems and Implicit Certificates. The results show that FLAT can reduce the data exchange overhead by around 31% when compared to a baseline solution. FLAT's Client is also more efficient than the baseline solution in terms of data transmitted, data received, total data exchange, and computation time. Our results indicate that FLAT runs efficiently even on top of resource-constrained devices like Arduino.",

We present the threat model and provide preliminary results of an online survey. Based on our results, we discuss potential countermeasures. We conclude that better feedback design and security-optimized fallback mechanisms can help further improve the overall security of mobile unlock mechanisms while preserving usability.",

Similar techniques have been also proposed for establishing a time-covert cryptographic authentication channel, in this way cleverly removing the need for cryptographic material inside the limited payload of CAN frames. The main shortcoming of such works is the limited security level that can be achieved under normal CAN-bus traffic. In this work we endeavour to test the limits of the achievable security level by relying on optimization algorithms for scheduling CAN frames. Under practical bus allocations that are based on real-world scenarios, we are able to extract around 4--5 bits of authentication data from each frame which leads to an efficient intrusion detection and authentication mechanism. By accumulating covert channel data over several consecutive frames, we can achieve higher security levels that are in line with current security demands. To prove the correctness of our approach, we present experiments on state-of-the-art automotive-grade controllers (Infineon Aurix) and bus measurements with the use of industry standard tools, i.e., CANoe.",

Unlike the corresponding classical cryptographic approaches which are all based on computational security, PLS's added strength is that it is based on information theoretic security, in which no limitation with respect to the opponent's computational power is assumed and is therefore inherently quantum resistant. In this survey, we review the aforementioned fundamental aspects of PLS, starting with node authentication, moving to the information theoretic characterization of message integrity, and finally, discussing message confidentiality both in the secret key generation from shared randomness and from the wiretap channel point of view. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive roadmap on important relevant results by the authors and other contributors and discuss open issues on the applicability of PLS in sixth generation systems.",

With respect to the latter, we investigate a parallel SKG approach for multi-carrier systems, where a subset of the subcarriers are used for SKG and the rest for data transmission. The optimal resource allocation is identified under security, power and delay constraints, by formulating the subcarrier allocation as a subset-sum $0-1$ knapsack optimization problem. A heuristic approach of linear complexity is proposed and shown to incur negligible loss with respect to the optimal dynamic programming solution. All of the proposed mechanisms, have the potential to pave the way for a new breed of latency aware security protocols.",

To address this problem, we propose a novel sender authentication technique that uses power consumption measurements of the ECU to authenticate the sender of a message. When an ECU is transmitting, its power requirement is affected, and a characteristic pattern appears in its power consumption. Our technique exploits the power consumption of each ECU during the transmission of a message to determine whether the message actually originated from the purported sender. We evaluate our approach in both a lab setup and a real vehicle. We also evaluate our approach against factors that can impact the power consumption measurement of the ECU. The results of the evaluation show that the proposed technique is applicable in a broad range of operating conditions with reasonable computational power requirements and attaining good accuracy.",

In this work, we demonstrated that wolf (generic) faces, which we call \"master faces,\" can also compromise face recognition systems and that the master face concept can be generalized in some cases. Motivated by recent similar work in the fingerprint domain, we generated high-quality master faces by using the state-of-the-art face generator StyleGAN in a process called latent variable evolution. Experiments demonstrated that even attackers with limited resources using only pre-trained models available on the Internet can initiate master face attacks. The results, in addition to demonstrating performance from the attacker's point of view, can also be used to clarify and improve the performance of face recognition systems and harden face authentication systems.",

The severe security flaw discourages the adoption of the Internet of things in smart living. In this paper, we leverage fog computing and microservice to push certificate authority (CA) functions to the proximity of data sources. Through which, we can minimize attack surfaces and authentication latency, and result in a fast and scalable scheme in authenticating a large volume of resource-limited devices. Then, we design lightweight protocols to implement the scheme, where both a high level of security and low computation workloads on SO (no bilinear pairing requirement on the client-side) is accomplished. Evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our scheme in handling authentication and registration for a large number of nodes, meanwhile protecting them against various threats to smart living. Finally, we showcase the success of computing intelligence movement towards data sources in handling complicated services.",

Trustworthy emissions accounting is the cornerstone of such a system encompassing different jurisdictions.

    "abstract": "With the increasing amount of interconnections between vehicles, the attack surface of internal vehicle networks is rising steeply. Although these networks are shielded against external attacks, they often do not have any internal security to protect against malicious components or adversaries who breach the network perimeter. To secure the in-vehicle network, all communicating components must be authenticated, and only authorized components should be allowed to send and receive messages. This is achieved using an authentication framework. Cryptography is widely used to authenticate communicating parties and provide secure communication channels (e.g., Internet communication). However, the real-time performance requirements of in-vehicle networks restrict the types of cryptographic algorithms and protocols that may be used. In particular, asymmetric cryptography is computationally infeasible during vehicle operation. In this work, we address the challenges of designing authentication protocols for automotive systems. We present Lightweight Authentication for Secure Automotive Networks (LASAN), a full lifecycle authentication approach. We describe the core LASAN protocols and show how they protect the internal vehicle network while complying with the real-time constraints and low computational resources of this domain. Unlike previous work, we also explain how this framework can be integrated into all aspects of the automotive lifecycle, including manufacturing, vehicle maintenance, and software updates. We evaluate LASAN in two different ways: First, we analyze the security properties of the protocols using established protocol verification techniques based on formal methods. Second, we evaluate the timing requirements of LASAN and compare these to other frameworks using a new highly modular discrete event simulator for in-vehicle networks, which we have developed for this evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Current authentication methods on the Web have serious weaknesses. First, services heavily rely on the traditional password paradigm, which diminishes the end-users' security and usability. Second, the lack of attribute-based authentication does not allow anonymity-preserving access to services. Third, users have multiple online accounts that often reflect distinct identity aspects. This makes proving combinations of identity attributes hard on the users. In this paper, we address these weaknesses by proposing a privacy-preserving architecture for device-centric and attribute-based authentication based on: 1) the seamless integration between usable/strong device-centric authentication methods and federated login solutions; 2) the separation of the concerns for Authorization, Authentication, Behavioral Authentication and Identification to facilitate incremental deployability, wide adoption and compliance with NIST assurance levels; and 3) a novel centralized component that allows end-users to perform identity profile and consent management, to prove combinations of fragmented identity aspects, and to perform account recovery in case of device loss. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort towards fusing the aforementioned techniques under an integrated architecture. This architecture effectively deems the password paradigm obsolete with minimal modification on the service provider's software stack.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks have emerged as a new technology in modern electric power transmission networks. It allows bi-directional flow of communication and electricity between electric vehicles (EVs) and the Smart Grid (SG), in order to provide more sophisticated energy trading. However, due to the involvement of a huge amount of trading data and the presence of untrusted entities in the visiting networks, the underlying V2G infrastructure suffers from various security and privacy challenges. Although, several solutions have been proposed in the literature to address these problems, issues like lack of mutual authentication and anonymity, incapability to protect against several attack vectors, generation of huge overhead, and dependency on centralized infrastructures make security and privacy issues even more challenging. To address the above mentioned problems, in this paper, we propose a blockchain oriented hierarchical authentication mechanism for rewarding EVs. The overall process is broadly classified into the following phases: 1) System Initialization, 2) Registration, 3) Hierarchical Mutual Authentication, and 4) Consensus; wherein blockchain's distributed ledger has been employed for transaction execution in distributed V2G environments while Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has been used for hierarchical authentication. The designed hierarchical authentication mechanism has been employed to preserve the anonymity of EVs and support mutual authentication between EVs, charging stations (CSs) and the central aggregator (CAG). Additionally, it also supports minimal communicational and computational overheads on resource constrained EVs. Further, formal security verification of the proposed scheme on widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool validates its safeness against different security attacks.",

    "abstract": "We study communication over multiple access channels (MAC) where one of the users is possibly adversarial. When all users are non-adversarial, we want their messages to be decoded reliably. When an adversary is present, we consider two different decoding guarantees. In part I, we require that the honest users' messages be decoded reliably. We study the 3-user MAC; 2-user MAC capacity follows from point-to-point AVC capacity. We characterize the capacity region for randomized codes. We also study the capacity region for deterministic codes. We obtain necessary conditions including a new non-symmetrizability condition for the capacity region to be non-trivial. We show that when none of the users are symmetrizable, the randomized coding capacity region is also achievable with deterministic codes. In part II, we consider the weaker goal of authenticated communication where we only require that an adversarial user must not be able to cause an undetected error on the honest users' messages. For the 2-user MAC, we show that the following 3-phase scheme is rate-optimal: a standard MAC code is first used to achieve unauthenticated communication followed by two authentication phases where each user authenticates their message treating the other user as a possible adversary. We show that the authentication phases can be very short since this form of authentication itself, when possible, can be achieved for message sets whose size grow doubly exponentially in blocklength. This leads to our result that the authenticated communication capacity region of a discrete memoryless MAC is either zero or the (unauthenticated) MAC capacity region itself. This also, arguably, explains the similar nature of authenticated communication capacity of a discrete memoryless point-to-point adversarial channel recently found by Kosut and Kliewer (ITW, 2018).",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a relatively new technology that can be seen as a decentralised database. Blockchain systems heavily rely on cryptographic hash functions to store their data, which makes it difficult to tamper with any data stored in the system. A topic that was researched along with blockchain is image authentication. Image authentication focuses on investigating and maintaining the integrity of images. As a blockchain system can be useful for maintaining data integrity, image authentication has the potential to be enhanced by blockchain. There are many techniques that can be used to authenticate images; the technique investigated by this work is image hashing. Image hashing is a technique used to calculate how similar two different images are. This is done by converting the images into hashes and then comparing them using a distance formula. To investigate the topic, an experiment involving a simulated blockchain was created. The blockchain acted as a database for images. This blockchain was made up of devices which contained their own unique image hashing algorithms. The blockchain was tested by creating modified copies of the images contained in the database, and then submitting them to the blockchain to see if it will return the original image. Through this experiment it was discovered that it is plausible to create an image authentication system using blockchain and image hashing. However, the design proposed by this work requires refinement, as it appears to struggle in some situations. This work shows that blockchain can be a suitable approach for authenticating images, particularly via image hashing. Other observations include that using multiple image hash algorithms at the same time can increase performance in some cases, as well as that each type of test done to the blockchain has its own unique pattern to its data.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to construct matching algorithms for any biometric authentication systems. Conventional matching algorithms are not necessarily secure against strong intentional impersonation attacks such as wolf attacks. The wolf attack is an attempt to impersonate a genuine user by presenting a \"wolf\" to a biometric authentication system without the knowledge of a genuine user's biometric sample. A wolf is a sample which can be accepted as a match with multiple templates. The wolf attack probability (WAP) is the maximum success probability of the wolf attack, which was proposed by Une, Otsuka, Imai as a measure for evaluating security of biometric authentication systems. We present a principle for construction of secure matching algorithms against the wolf attack for any biometric authentication systems. The ideal matching algorithm determines a threshold for each input value depending on the entropy of the probability distribution of the (Hamming) distances. Then we show that if the information about the probability distribution for each input value is perfectly given, then our matching algorithm is secure against the wolf attack. Our generalized matching algorithm gives a theoretical framework to construct secure matching algorithms. How lower WAP is achievable depends on how accurately the entropy is estimated. Then there is a trade-off between the efficiency and the achievable WAP. Almost every conventional matching algorithm employs a fixed threshold and hence it can be regarded as an efficient but insecure instance of our theoretical framework. Daugman's IrisCode recognition algorithm proposed can also be regarded as a non-optimal instance of our framework.",

    "abstract": "Information and computer security is supported largely by passwords which are the principle part of the authentication process. The most common computer authentication method is to use alphanumerical username and password which has significant drawbacks. To overcome the vulnerabilities of traditional methods, visual or graphical password schemes have been developed as possible alternative solutions to text based scheme. A potential drawback of graphical password schemes is that they are more vulnerable to shoulder surfing than conventional alphanumeric text passwords. When users input their passwords in a public place, they may be at risk of attackers stealing their password. An attacker can capture a password by direct observation or by recording the individuals authentication session. This is referred to as shouldersurfing and is a known risk, of special concern when authenticating in public places. In this paper we will present a survey on graphical password schemes from 2005 till 2009 which are proposed to be resistant against shoulder surfing attacks.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, user authentication is one of the important topics in information security. Text based strong password schemes could provide with certain degree of security. However, the fact that strong passwords being difficult to memorize often leads their owners to write them down on papers or even save them in a computer file. Graphical user authentication (GUA) has been proposed as a possible alternative solution to text based authentication, motivated particularly by the fact that humans can remember images better than text. In recent years, many networks, computer systems and Internet based environments try used GUA technique for their users authentication. All of GUA algorithms have two different aspects which are usability and security. Unfortunately, none of graphical algorithms were being able to cover both of these aspects at the same time. This paper presents a wide range survey on the pure and cued recall based algorithms in GUA, based on ISO standards for usability and attack patterns standards for security. After explain usability ISO standards and attack patterns international standards, we try to collect the major attributes of usability and security in GUA. Finally, try to make comparison tables among all recall based algorithms based on usability attributes and attack patterns those we found.",

It becomes more convenience and desirable for mobile internet users to be connected everywhere. However, ubiquitous mobile access connectivity faces interoperation issues between wireless network providers and wireless network technologies. Although mobile users would like to get as many services as possible while they travel, there is a lack of technology to identify visited users in current foreign network authentication systems. This challenge lies in the fact that a foreign network provider does not initially have the authentication credentials of a mobile user. Existing approaches use roaming agreement to exchange authentication information between home network and foreign network. This paper proposes a roaming agreement-less approach designed based on our ubiquitous mobile access model. Our approach consist of two tokens, Passport (identification token) and Visa (authorisation token) to provide the mobile user with a flexible authentication method to access foreign network services. The security analysis indicates that our proposal is more suitable for ubiquitous mobile communication especially in roaming agreement-less environment.",

    "abstract": "In their seminal work on authentication, Wegman and Carter propose that to authenticate multiple messages, it is sufficient to reuse the same hash function as long as each tag is encrypted with a one-time pad. They argue that because the one-time pad is perfectly hiding, the hash function used remains completely unknown to the adversary. Since their proof is not composable, we revisit it using a composable security framework. It turns out that the above argument is insufficient: if the adversary learns whether a corrupted message was accepted or rejected, information about the hash function is leaked, and after a bounded finite amount of rounds it is completely known. We show however that this leak is very small: Wegman and Carter's protocol is still $\\epsilon$-secure, if $\\epsilon$-almost strongly universal$_2$ hash functions are used. This implies that the secret key corresponding to the choice of hash function can be reused in the next round of authentication without any additional error than this $\\epsilon$. We also show that if the players have a mild form of synchronization, namely that the receiver knows when a message should be received, the key can be recycled for any arbitrary task, not only new rounds of authentication.",

    "abstract": "Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a keyed function $f_K$ such that when Alice, who shares the secret $K$ with Bob, sends $f_K(M)$ to the latter, Bob will be assured of the integrity and authenticity of $M$. Traditionally, it is assumed that the channel is noiseless. However, Maurer showed that in this case an attacker can succeed with probability $2^{-\\frac{H(K)}{\\ell+1}}$ after authenticating $\\ell$ messages. In this paper, we consider the setting where the channel is noisy. Specifically, Alice and Bob are connected by a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) $W_1$ and a noiseless but insecure channel. In addition, an attacker Oscar is connected with Alice through DMC $W_2$ and with Bob through a noiseless channel. In this setting, we study the framework that sends $M$ over the noiseless channel and the traditional MAC $f_K(M)$ over channel $(W_1, W_2)$. We regard the noisy channel as an expensive resource and define the authentication rate $\\rho_{auth}$ as the ratio of message length to the number $n$ of channel $W_1$ uses. The security of this framework depends on the channel coding scheme for $f_K(M)$. A natural coding scheme is to use the secrecy capacity achieving code of Csisz\\'{a}r and K\\\"{o}rner. Intuitively, this is also the optimal strategy. However, we propose a coding scheme that achieves a higher $\\rho_{auth}.$ Our crucial point for this is that in the secrecy capacity setting, Bob needs to recover $f_K(M)$ while in our coding scheme this is not necessary. How to detect the attack without recovering $f_K(M)$ is the main contribution of this work. We achieve this through random coding techniques.",

The current public key infrastructure cannot be used since the user's public key identifies the user. To cope with this issue, we propose a protocol that uses identity-based encryption for packet encryption without sacrificing anonymity, and group signature for anonymous user authentication. Communications in the protocol take place through proxy entities that conceal users' IP addresses from service providers. The underlying group signature is customized to meet our objective and improve its efficiency. We also introduce a proof-of-concept implementation to demonstrate the protocol's feasibility.

Using this condition, Maurer and Wolf showed a remarkable \"all or nothing\" result: if the simulatability condition does not hold, the key capacity over the non-authenticated public channel will be the same as that of the case with a passive Eve, while the key capacity over the non-authenticated channel will be zero if the simulatability condition holds. However, two questions remain open so far: 1) For a given joint probability mass function (PMF), are there efficient algorithms (polynomial complexity algorithms) for checking whether the simulatability condition holds or not?; and 2) If the simulatability condition holds, are there efficient algorithms for finding the corresponding attack strategy? In this paper, we answer these two open questions affirmatively. In particular, for a given joint PMF, we construct a linear programming (LP) problem and show that the simulatability condition holds \\textit{if and only if} the optimal value obtained from the constructed LP is zero. Furthermore, we construct another LP and show that the minimizer of the newly constructed LP is a valid attack strategy. Both LPs can be solved with a polynomial complexity.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement in technology, smart homes have become applicable and so the need arise to solve the security challenges that are accompanied with its operation. Passwords and identity cards have been used as traditional authentication mechanisms in home environments, however, the rise of misuse of these mechanisms are proving them to be less reliable. For instance, ID cards can be misplaced, copied or counterfeited and being misused. Conversely, studies have shown that biometrics authentication systems particularly Iris Recognition Technology (IRT) and Fingerprint Recognition Technology (FRT) have the most reliable mechanisms to date providing tremendous accuracy and speed. As the technology becomes less expensive, application of IRT& FRT in smart-homes becomes more reliable and appropriate solution for security challenges. In this paper, we present our approach to design an authentication system for smart homes based on IRT, FRT and ARM7TDMI.The system employs two biometrics mechanisms for high reliability whereby initially, system users must enroll their fingerprints and eyes into the camera. Iris and fingerprint biometrics are scanned and the images are stored in the database. In the stage of authentication, FRT and IRT fingerprint scan and analyze points of the user's current input iris and fingerprint and match with the database contents. If one or more captured images do not match with the one in the database, then the system will not give authorization.",

    "abstract": "This work is an implementation of a multifactor authentication SMS based result checking system. The objectives of this work were to improve on the available authentication methods and apply it on examination result checking system. The work takes care of only course codes with their grades, the current GPA and the overall CGPA. It employs the Pull SMS service, built on an independent service and a modem. Examination results consist of sensitive information, hence the need to further enhance the ones already in place so as to ensure further privacy and integrity, In the course of this project, the following assumptions were made: That a system that does the computation of students' result, calculate of GPA and CGPA is already in place. The implemented system was connected to the database of the existing system. A database that contains the bio-data of each student admitted exists. That SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) modem exists and should have been used but to reduce cost, a modem that can act like a SIM browser is used with a standard SIM card inserted in it and connected via cable to the application server. The system showed that further security and privacy could be achieved when multifactor authentication is employed. For further work, the system could be developed and built as a dependent service which involves having the application server connected to the service provider's SMS Center (SMSC).

    "abstract": "In the past, two main approaches for the purpose of authentication, including information-theoretic authentication codes and complexity-theoretic message authentication codes (MACs), were almost independently developed. In this paper, we propose a new cryptographic primitive, namely, artificial-noise-aided MACs (ANA-MACs), which can be considered as both computationally secure and information-theoretically secure. For ANA-MACs, we introduce artificial noise to interfere with the complexity-theoretic MACs and quantization is further employed to facilitate packet-based transmission. With a channel coding formulation of key recovery in the MACs, the generation of standard authentication tags can be seen as an encoding process for the ensemble of codes, where the shared key between Alice and Bob is considered as the input and the message is used to specify a code from the ensemble of codes. Then, we show that the introduction of artificial noise in ANA-MACs can be well employed to resist the key recovery attack even if the opponent has an unlimited computing power. Finally, a pragmatic approach for the analysis of ANA-MACs is provided, and we show how to balance the three performance metrics, including the completeness error, the false acceptance probability, and the conditional equivocation about the key. The analysis can be well applied to a class of ANA-MACs, where MACs with Rijndael cipher are employed.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose four continuous authentication designs by using the characteristics of arm movements while individuals walk. The first design uses acceleration of arms captured by a smartwatch's accelerometer sensor, the second design uses the rotation of arms captured by a smartwatch's gyroscope sensor, third uses the fusion of both acceleration and rotation at the feature-level and fourth uses the fusion at score-level. Each of these designs is implemented by using four classifiers, namely, k nearest neighbors (k-NN) with Euclidean distance, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptrons, and Random Forest resulting in a total of sixteen authentication mechanisms. These authentication mechanisms are tested under three different environments, namely an intra-session, inter-session on a dataset of 40 users and an inter-phase on a dataset of 12 users. The sessions of data collection were separated by at least ten minutes, whereas the phases of data collection were separated by at least three months. Under the intra-session environment, all of the twelve authentication mechanisms achieve a mean dynamic false accept rate (DFAR) of 0% and dynamic false reject rate (DFRR) of 0%. For the inter-session environment, feature level fusion-based design with classifier k-NN achieves the best error rates that are a mean DFAR of 2.2% and DFRR of 4.2%. The DFAR and DFRR increased from 5.68% and 4.23% to 15.03% and 14.62% respectively when feature level fusion-based design with classifier k-NN was tested under the inter-phase environment on a dataset of 12 users.",

While discovery protocols like Multicast DNS, Apple AirDrop, and Bluetooth Low Energy have gained widespread adoption across both IoT and mobile devices, most of these protocols do not offer any form of privacy control for the service, and often leak sensitive information such as service type, device hostname, device owner's identity, and more in the clear. To address the need for better privacy in both the IoT and the mobile landscape, we develop two protocols for private service discovery and private mutual authentication. Our protocols provide private and authentic service advertisements, zero round-trip (0-RTT) mutual authentication, and are provably secure in the Canetti-Krawczyk key-exchange model. In contrast to alternatives, our protocols are lightweight and require minimal modification to existing key-exchange protocols. We integrate our protocols into an existing open-source distributed applications framework, and provide benchmarks on multiple hardware platforms: Intel Edisons, Raspberry Pis, smartphones, laptops, and desktops. Finally, we discuss some privacy limitations of the Apple AirDrop protocol (a peer-to-peer file sharing mechanism) and show how to improve the privacy of Apple AirDrop using our private mutual authentication protocol.",

    "abstract": "Biometric authentication involves various technologies to identify individuals by exploiting their unique, measurable physiological and behavioral characteristics. However, traditional biometric authentication systems (e.g., face recognition, iris, retina, voice, and fingerprint) are facing an increasing risk of being tricked by biometric tools such as anti-surveillance masks, contact lenses, vocoder, or fingerprint films. In this paper, we design a multimodal biometric authentication system named Deepkey, which uses both Electroencephalography (EEG) and gait signals to better protect against such risk. Deepkey consists of two key components: an Invalid ID Filter Model to block unauthorized subjects and an identification model based on attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to identify a subject`s EEG IDs and gait IDs in parallel. The subject can only be granted access while all the components produce consistent evidence to match the user`s proclaimed identity. We implement Deepkey with a live deployment in our university and conduct extensive empirical experiments to study its technical feasibility in practice. DeepKey achieves the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and the False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 0 and 1.0%, respectively. The preliminary results demonstrate that Deepkey is feasible, show consistent superior performance compared to a set of methods, and has the potential to be applied to the authentication deployment in real world settings.",

One of most popular structures is time-delay based Arbiter PUF attributing to large number of challenge response pairs (CRPs) yielded and its compact realization. However, modeling building attacks threaten most variants of APUFs that are usually employed for strong PUF-oriented application---lightweight authentication---without reliance on the securely stored digital secrets based standard cryptographic protocols. In this paper, we investigate a reconfigurable latent obfuscation technique endowed PUF construction, coined as OB-PUF, to maintain the security of elementary PUF CRPs enabled authentication where a CRP is never used more than once. The obfuscation---determined by said random patterns---conceals and distorts the relationship between challenge-response pairs capable of thwarting a model building adversary needing to know the exact relationship between challenges and responses. A bit further, the obfuscation is hidden and reconfigured on demand, in other words, the patterns are not only invisible but also act as one-time pads that are only employed once per authentication around and then discarded. As a consequence, the OB-PUF demonstrates significant resistance to the recent revealed powerful Evaluation Strategy (ES) based modeling attacks where the direct relationship between challenge and response is even not a must. The OB-PUF's uniqueness and reliability metrics are also systematically studied followed by formal authentication capability evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Biometrics have a long-held hope of replacing passwords by establishing a non-repudiated identity and providing authentication with convenience. Convenience drives consumers toward biometrics-based access management solutions. Unlike passwords, biometrics cannot be script-injected; however, biometric data is considered highly sensitive due to its personal nature and unique association with users. Biometrics differ from passwords in that compromised passwords may be reset. Compromised biometrics offer no such relief. A compromised biometric offers unlimited risk in privacy (anyone can view the biometric) and authentication (anyone may use the biometric). Standards such as the Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS) (IEEE 2410-2016) provide a detailed mechanism to authenticate biometrics based on pre-enrolled devices and a previous identity by storing the biometric in encrypted form. This paper describes a biometric-agnostic approach that addresses the privacy concerns of biometrics through the implementation of BOPS. Specifically, two novel concepts are introduced. First, a biometric is applied to a neural network to create a feature vector. This neural network alone can be used for one-to-one matching (authentication), but would require a search in linear time for the one-to-many case (identity lookup). The classifying algorithm described in this paper addresses this concern by producing normalized floating-point values for each feature vector. This allows authentication lookup to occur in up to polynomial time, allowing for search in encrypted biometric databases with speed, accuracy and privacy.",

Classically, security games use string copying and comparison to detect adversarial cheating in such scenarios. Quantumly, this approach would violate no-cloning. We develop new techniques to overcome this problem: we use entanglement to detect cheating, and rely on recent results for characterizing quantum encryption schemes. We give definitions for (i.) ciphertext unforgeability , (ii.) indistinguishability under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack, and (iii.) authenticated encryption. The restriction of each definition to the classical setting is at least as strong as the corresponding classical notion: (i) implies INT-CTXT, (ii) implies IND-CCA2, and (iii) implies AE. All of our new notions also imply QIND-CPA privacy. Combining one-time authentication and classical pseudorandomness, we construct schemes for each of these new quantum security notions, and provide several separation examples. Along the way, we also give a new definition of one-time quantum authentication which, unlike all previous approaches, authenticates ciphertexts rather than plaintexts.",

Skin secretions contain a large number of metabolites and small molecules that can be targeted for analysis. Here we argue that amino acids found in sweat can be exploited for the establishment of an amino acid profile capable of identifying an individual user of a mobile or wearable device. Individual and combinations of amino acids processed by biocatalytic cascades yield physical (optical or electronic) signals, providing a time-series of several outputs that, in their entirety, should suffice to authenticate a specific user based on standard statistical criteria. Initial results, motivated by biometrics, indicate that single amino acid levels can provide analog signals that vary according to the individual donor, albeit with limited resolution versus noise. However, some such assays offer digital separation (into well-defined ranges of values) according to groups such as age, biological sex, race, and physiological state of the individual. Multi-input biocatalytic cascades that handle several amino acid signals to yield a single digital-type output, as well as continuous-tracking time-series data rather than a single-instance sample, should enable active authentication at the level of an individual.",

    "abstract": "Reaping the benefits of the Internet of things (IoT) system is contingent upon developing IoT-specific security solutions. Conventional security and authentication solutions often fail to meet IoT security requirements due to the computationally limited and portable nature of IoT objects. In this paper, an IoT objects authentication framework is proposed. The framework uses device-specific information, called fingerprints, along with a transfer learning tool to authenticate objects in the IoT. The framework tracks the effect of changes in the physical environment on fingerprints and uses unique IoT environmental effects features to detect both cyber and cyber-physical emulation attacks. The proposed environmental effects estimation framework is proven to improve the detection rate of attackers without increasing the false positives rate. The proposed framework is also shown to be able to detect cyber-physical attackers that are capable of replicating the fingerprints of target objects which conventional methods are unable to detect. A transfer learning approach is proposed to allow the use of objects with different types and features in the environmental effects estimation process to enhance the performance of the framework while capturing practical IoT deployments with diverse object types. Simulation results using real IoT device data show that the proposed approach can yield a 40% improvement in cyber emulation attacks detection and is able to detect cyber-physical emulation attacks that conventional methods cannot detect. The results also show that the proposed framework improves the authentication accuracy while the transfer learning approach yields up to 70% additional performance gains.",

    "abstract": "Keystroke dynamics-based user authentication (KDA) based on long and freely typed text is an enhanced user authentication method that can not only identify the validity of current users during login but also continuously monitors the consistency of typing behavior after the login process. Previous long and freely typed text-based KDA methods had difficulty incorporating the key sequence information and handling variable lengths of keystrokes, which in turn resulted in lower authentication performance compared to KDA methods based on short and fixed-length text. To overcome these limitations, we propose a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based KDA model. As the RNN model can process an arbitrary length of input and target sequences, our proposed model takes two consecutive keys as the input sequence and actual typing time for the corresponding key sequence as the target sequence. Based on experimental results involving 120 participants, our proposed RNN-KDA model yielded the best authentication performance for all training and test length combinations in terms of equal error rate (EER). It achieved a 5%-6% EER using only 10 test keystrokes while the EERs of other benchmark methods were above 20%. In addition, its performance steadily and more rapidly improves compared to the benchmark methods when the length of training keystrokes increases.",

    "abstract": "Alphanumeric authentication routinely fails to regulate access to resources with the required stringency, primarily due to usability issues. Initial deployment did not reveal the problems of passwords, deep and profound flaws only emerged once passwords were deployed in the wild. The need for a replacement is widely acknowledged yet despite over a decade of research into knowledge-based alternatives, few, if any, have been adopted by industry. Alternatives are unconvincing for three primary reasons. The first is that alternatives are rarely investigated beyond the initial proposal, with only the results from a constrained lab test provided to convince adopters of their viability. The second is that alternatives are seldom tested realistically where the authenticator mediates access to something of value. The third is that the testing rarely varies the device or context beyond that initially targeted. In the modern world different devices are used across a variety of contexts. What works well in one context may easily fail in another. Consequently, the contribution of this paper is an \"in the wild\" evaluation of an alternative authentication mechanism that had demonstrated promise in its lab evaluation. In the field test the mechanism was deployed to actual users to regulate access to an application in a context beyond that initially proposed. The performance of the mechanism is reported and discussed. We conclude by reflecting on the value of field evaluations of alternative authentication mechanisms.",

However, such implicit proximity verification is not secure against an adversary who can relay messages over a larger distance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for thwarting relay attacks in TA schemes: the prover permits access to authentication credentials only if it can confirm that it is near the verifier. We present STASH, a system for relay-resilient transparent authentication in which the prover does proximity verification by comparing its approach trajectory towards the intended verifier with known authorized reference trajectories. Trajectories are measured using low-cost sensors commonly available on personal devices. We demonstrate the security of STASH against a class of adversaries and its ease-of-use by analyzing empirical data, collected using a STASH prototype. STASH is efficient and can be easily integrated to complement existing TA schemes.",

    "abstract": "In encryption, non-malleability is a highly desirable property: it ensures that adversaries cannot manipulate the plaintext by acting on the ciphertext. Ambainis, Bouda and Winter gave a definition of non-malleability for the encryption of quantum data. In this work, we show that this definition is too weak, as it allows adversaries to \"inject\" plaintexts of their choice into the ciphertext. We give a new definition of quantum non-malleability which resolves this problem. Our definition is expressed in terms of entropic quantities, considers stronger adversaries, and does not assume secrecy. Rather, we prove that quantum non-malleability implies secrecy; this is in stark contrast to the classical setting, where the two properties are completely independent. For unitary schemes, our notion of non-malleability is equivalent to encryption with a two-design (and hence also to the definition of Ambainis et al.). Our techniques also yield new results regarding the closely-related task of quantum authentication. We show that \"total authentication\" (a notion recently proposed by Garg, Yuen and Zhandry) can be satisfied with two-designs, a significant improvement over the eight-design construction of Garg et al. We also show that, under a mild adaptation of the rejection procedure, both total authentication and our notion of non-malleability yield quantum authentication as defined by Dupuis, Nielsen and Salvail.",

This paper presents a novel user authentication system through wrist-worn devices by analyzing the interaction behavior with users, which is both accurate and efficient for future usage. The key feature of our approach lies in using much more effective Savitzky-Golay filter and Dynamic Time Wrapping method to obtain fine-grained writing metrics for user authentication. These new metrics are relatively unique from person to person and independent of the computing platform. Analyses are conducted on the wristband-interaction data collected from 50 users with diversity in gender, age, and height. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach can identify users in a timely and accurate manner, with a false-negative rate of 1.78\\%, false-positive rate of 6.7\\%, and Area Under ROC Curve of 0.983 .

    "abstract": "The proliferation of online biometric authentication has necessitated security requirements of biometric templates. The existing secure biometric authentication schemes feature a server-centric model, where a service provider maintains a biometric database and is fully responsible for the security of the templates. The end-users have to fully trust the server in storing, processing and managing their private templates. As a result, the end-users' templates could be compromised by outside attackers or even the service provider itself. In this paper, we propose a user-centric biometric authentication scheme (PassBio) that enables end-users to encrypt their own templates with our proposed light-weighted encryption scheme. During authentication, all the templates remain encrypted such that the server will never see them directly. However, the server is able to determine whether the distance of two encrypted templates is within a pre-defined threshold. Our security analysis shows that no critical information of the templates can be revealed under both passive and active attacks. PassBio follows a \"compute-then-compare\" computational model over encrypted data. More specifically, our proposed Threshold Predicate Encryption (TPE) scheme can encrypt two vectors x and y in such a manner that the inner product of x and y can be evaluated and compared to a pre-defined threshold. TPE guarantees that only the comparison result is revealed and no key information about x and y can be learned. Furthermore, we show that TPE can be utilized as a flexible building block to evaluate different distance metrics such as Hamming distance and Euclidean distance over encrypted data. Such a compute-then-compare computational model, enabled by TPE, can be widely applied in many interesting applications such as searching over encrypted data while ensuring data security and privacy.",

    "abstract": "One-time login process in conventional authentication systems does not guarantee that the identified user is the actual user throughout the session. However, it is necessary to re-verify the user identity periodically throughout a login session without reducing the user convenience. Continuous authentication can address this issue. However, existing methods are either not reliable or not usable. In this paper, we introduce a usable and reliable method called Wearable Assisted Continuous Authentication (WACA). WACA relies on the sensor based keystroke dynamics, where the authentication data is acquired through the built in sensors of a wearable (e.g., smartwatch) while the user is typing. We implemented the WACA framework and evaluated its performance on real devices with real users. The empirical evaluation of WACA reveals that WACA is feasible and its error rate is as low as 1 percent with 30 seconds of processing time and 2 3% for 20 seconds. The computational overhead is minimal. Furthermore, we tested WACA against different attack scenarios. WACA is capable of identifying insider threats with very high accuracy (99.2%) and also robust against powerful adversaries such as imitation and statistical attackers.",

    "abstract": "A physical unclonable function (PUF) generates hardware intrinsic volatile secrets by exploiting uncontrollable manufacturing randomness. Although PUFs provide the potential for lightweight and secure authentication for increasing numbers of low-end Internet of Things devices, practical and secure mechanisms remain elusive. We aim to explore simulatable PUFs (SimPUFs) that are physically unclonable but efficiently modeled mathematically through privileged one-time PUF access to address the above problem. Given a challenge, a securely stored SimPUF in possession of a trusted server computes the corresponding response and its bit-specific reliability. Consequently, naturally noisy PUF responses generated by a resource limited prover can be immediately processed by a one-way function (OWF) and transmitted to the server, because the resourceful server can exploit the SimPUF to perform a trial-and-error search over likely error patterns to recover the noisy response to authenticate the prover. Security of trial-and-error reverse (TREVERSE) authentication under the random oracle model is guaranteed by the hardness of inverting the OWF. We formally evaluate the TREVERSE authentication capability with two SimPUFs experimentally derived from popular silicon PUFs.",

We focus on the transformation between text-based passwords (TB-paws) and Topsnut-gpws in this article. Several methods for generating TB-paws from Topsnut-gpws are introduced; these methods are based on topological structures and graph coloring/labellings, such that authentications must have two steps: one is topological structure authentication, and another is text-based authentication. Four basic topological structure authentications are introduced and many text-based authentications follow Topsnut-gpws. Our methods are based on algebraic, number theory and graph theory, many of them can be transformed into polynomial algorithms. A new type of matrices for describing Topsnut-gpws is created here, and such matrices can produce TB-paws in complex forms and longer bytes. Estimating the space of TB-paws made by Topsnut-gpws is very important for application. We propose to encrypt dynamic networks and try to face: (1) thousands of nodes and links of dynamic networks; (2) large numbers of Topsnut-gpws generated by machines rather than human's hands. As a try, we apply spanning trees of dynamic networks and graphic groups (Topsnut-groups) to approximate the solutions of these two problems.

    "abstract": "Defense mechanisms against network-level attacks are commonly based on the use of cryptographic techniques, such as message authentication codes that provide data integrity guarantees. However, such mechanisms require significant resources, which prevents their continuous use in resource-constrained cyber-physical systems. Recently, it was shown how physical properties of plants can be exploited to relax these requirements for systems where sensor measurements and actuator commands are transmitted over a compromised network; specifically, intermittent use of data authentication, can still provide Quality-of-Control (QoC) guarantees even in the presence of false-data injection attacks. Consequently, in this work we focus on integrating security into existing systems, in order to protect against these attacks. We introduce a design-time methodology that incorporates requirements for QoC in the presence of attacks into end-to-end timing constraints for real-time control transactions, which include data acquisition and authentication, communication, and control. This allows us to formulate a mixed integer linear programming-based method for synthesis of schedulable task and message parameters (i.e., deadlines and offsets) that maintain timing requirements of deployed controllers, while adding a sufficient level of protection against attacks; specifically, this method provides suitable intermittent authentication policies that ensure the desired QoC levels under attack. To additionally reduce the security-related bandwidth overhead, we propose the use of cumulative message authentication. Furthermore, we introduce a method for opportunistic use of remaining resources to further improve the overall QoC guarantees while ensuring system schedulability. Finally, we demonstrate applicability of our methodology on synthetic automotive systems as well as an automotive case-study.",

This development involves new categories of capable devices, such as high-end wearables, smart vehicles, and consumer drones aiming to enable efficient and collaborative utilization within the Smart City paradigm. While massive deployments of these objects may enrich people's lives, unauthorized access to the said equipment is potentially dangerous. Hence, highly-secure human authentication mechanisms have to be designed. At the same time, human beings desire comfortable interaction with their owned devices on a daily basis, thus demanding the authentication procedures to be seamless and user-friendly, mindful of the contemporary urban dynamics. In response to these unique challenges, this work advocates for the adoption of multi-factor authentication for A-IoT, such that multiple heterogeneous methods - both well-established and emerging - are combined intelligently to grant or deny access reliably. We thus discuss the pros and cons of various solutions as well as introduce tools to combine the authentication factors, with an emphasis on challenging Smart City environments. We finally outline the open questions to shape future research efforts in this emerging field.",

The new entrants pose the potential risks when they move into the secure zone. To build a door wall that provides safe and secured for the system, many recent research works applied the initial authentication process. However, the majority of the previous articles only focused on the Central Authority (CA) since this leads to an increase in the computation cost and energy consumption for the specific cases on the Internet of Things (IoT). Hence, in this article, we will lessen the importance of these third parties through proposing an enhanced authentication mechanism that includes key management and evaluation based on the past interactions to assist the objects joining a secured area without any nearby CA. We refer to a mobility dataset from CRAWDAD collected at the University Politehnica of Bucharest and rebuild into a new random dataset larger than the old one. The new one is an input for a simulated authenticating algorithm to observe the communication cost and resource usage of devices. Our proposal helps the authenticating flexible, being strict with unknown devices into the secured zone. The threshold of maximum friends can modify based on the optimization of the symmetric-key algorithm to diminish communication costs (our experimental results compare to previous schemes less than 2000 bits) and raise flexibility in resource-constrained environments.",

In existing blockchain protocols, upon generation of a new block, each IoT device receives a copy of the block header, authenticated via digital signature by one or more trusted servers. Since it relies on unicast transmissions, the required communication resources grow linearly with the number of IoT devices. We propose a more efficient scheme, in which a single copy of each block header is multicasted, together with the signatures of servers. In addition, if IoT devices tolerate a delay, we exploit the blockchain structure to amortize the authentication in time, by transmitting only a subset of signature in each block period. Finally, the BS sends redundant information, via a repetition code, to deal with the unreliable wireless channel, with the aim of decreasing the amount of feedback required from IoT devices. Our analysis shows the trade-off between timely authentication of blocks and reliability of the communication, depending on the packet loss rate offered by the channel. The numerical results show that the performance benefits of the proposed scheme makes it a viable starting point for designing new lightweight protocols for blockchains.",

Noticeably, the monitoring of the personal expenses is now opened to other institutions than retail banks. Nonetheless, the retail banks are looking to leverage the user-device authentication on the mobile banking applications to enhance the personal financial advertisement. To address the profiling of the authentication, we rely on tensor decomposition, a higher dimensional analogue of matrix decomposition. We use Paratuck2, which expresses a tensor as a multiplication of matrices and diagonal tensors, because of the imbalance between the number of users and devices. We highlight why Paratuck2 is more appropriate in this case than the popular CP tensor decomposition, which decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors. However, the computation of Paratuck2 is computational intensive. We propose a new APproximate HEssian-based Newton resolution algorithm, APHEN, capable of solving Paratuck2 more accurately and faster than the other popular approaches based on alternating least square or gradient descent. The results of Paratuck2 are used for the predictions of users' authentication with neural networks.

Conventional authentication and authorization schemes are insufficient in dealing the emerging IoT security challenges due to their reliance on both static digital mechanisms and computational complexity for improving security level. Furthermore, the isolated security designs for different layers and link segments while ignoring the overall protection lead to cascaded security risks as well as growing communication latency and overhead. In this article, we envision new artificial intelligence (AI) enabled security provisioning approaches to overcome these issues while achieving fast authentication and progressive authorization. To be more specific, a lightweight intelligent authentication approach is developed by exploring machine learning at the gateway to identify the access time slots or frequencies of resource-constraint devices. Then we propose a holistic authentication and authorization approach, where online machine learning and trust management are adopted for analyzing the complex dynamic environment and achieving adaptive access control. These new AI enabled approaches establish the connections between transceivers quickly and enhance security progressively, so that communication latency can be reduced and security risks are well-controlled in large-scale IoT.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the vulnerability of anti-spoofing methods based on deep learning against adversarial perturbations. We first show that attacking a CNN-based anti-spoofing face authentication system turns out to be a difficult task. When a spoofed face image is attacked in the physical world, in fact, the attack has not only to remove the rebroadcast artefacts present in the image, but it has also to take into account that the attacked image will be recaptured again and then compensate for the distortions that will be re-introduced after the attack by the subsequent rebroadcast process. Subsequently, we propose a method to craft robust physical domain adversarial images against anti-spoofing CNN-based face authentication. The attack built in this way can successfully pass all the steps in the authentication chain (that is, face detection, face recognition and spoofing detection), by achieving simultaneously the following goals: i) make the spoofing detection fail; ii) let the facial region be detected as a face and iii) recognized as belonging to the victim of the attack. The effectiveness of the proposed attack is validated experimentally within a realistic setting, by considering the REPLAY-MOBILE database, and by feeding the adversarial images to a real face authentication system capturing the input images through a mobile phone camera.",

In particular, the adversary has access to a non-causal noisy version of the transmission and may use this knowledge to choose the channel state of an arbitrarily-varying channel between legitimate users; the receiver is successful if it either decodes to the correct message or correctly detects adversarial interference. We show that a channel condition called U-overwritability, which allows the adversary to make its false message appear legitimate and untampered with, is a sufficient condition for zero authentication capacity. We present a useful way to compare adversarial channels, and show that once an AVC becomes U-overwritable, it remains U-overwritable for all \"less myopic\" adversaries. Finally, we show that stochastic encoders are necessary for positive authentication capacity in some cases, and examine in detail a binary adversarial channel that illustrates this necessity. Namely, for this binary channel, we show that when the adversarial channel is degraded with respect to the main channel between users, the no-adversary capacity of the underlying channel is achievable with a deterministic encoder. Otherwise, provided the channel to the adversary is not perfect, a stochastic encoder is necessary for positive authentication capacity; if such an encoder is allowed, the no-adversary capacity is again achievable.",

Specifically, the UWA channel is under impersonation attack by a malicious node (Eve) present in the close vicinity of the legitimate node pair (Alice and Bob); Eve tries to inject its malicious data into the system by making Bob believe that she is indeed Alice. To thwart the impersonation attack by Eve, Bob utilizes the distance of the transmit node as the feature/fingerprint to carry out feature-based authentication at the physical layer. Due to authentication at Bob, due to lack of channel knowledge at the transmit node (Alice or Eve), and due to the threshold-based decoding error model, the relevant dynamics of the considered system could be modelled by a Markov chain (MC). Thus, we compute the state-transition probabilities of the MC, and the moment generating function for the service process corresponding to each state. This enables us to derive a closed-form expression of the EC in terms of authentication parameters. Furthermore, we compute the optimal transmission rate (at Alice) through gradient-descent (GD) technique and artificial neural network (ANN) method. Simulation results show that the EC decreases under severe authentication constraints (i.e., more false alarms and more transmissions by Eve). Simulation results also reveal that the (optimal transmission rate) performance of the ANN technique is quite close to that of the GD method.",

In active voice authentication (AVA), voice is the biometric modality. This paper describes an ensemble of techniques that make reliable speaker verification possible using unconventionally short voice test signals. These techniques include model adaptation and minimum verification error (MVE) training that are tailored for the extremely short training and testing requirements. A database of 25 speakers is recorded for developing this system. In our off-line evaluation on this dataset, the system achieves an average windowed-based equal error rates of 3-4% depending on the model configuration, which is remarkable considering that only 1 second of voice data is used to make every single authentication decision. On the NIST SRE 2001 Dataset, the system provides a 3.88% absolute gain over i-vector when the duration of test segment is 1 second.

    "abstract": "Although almost all information about Smart Contract addresses is shared via websites, emails, or other forms of digital communication, Blockchains and distributed ledger technology are unable to establish secure bindings between websites and corresponding Smart Contracts. For a user, it is impossible to differentiate whether a website links to a legitimate Smart Contract set up by owners of a business or to an illicit contract aiming to steal users' funds. Surprisingly, current attempts to solve this issue mostly comprise of information redundancy, e.g., displaying contract addresses multiple times in varying forms of images and texts. These processes are burdensome, as the user is responsible for verifying the correctness of an address. More importantly, they do not address the core issue, as the contract itself does not contain information about its authenticity. To solve current issues for these applications and increase security, we propose a solution that facilitates publicly issued SSL/TLS-certificates of Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) to ensure the authenticity of Smart Contracts and their owners. Our approach combines on-chain identity assertion utilizing signatures from the respective certificate and off-chain authentication of the Smart Contract stored on the Blockchain. This approach allows to tackle the aforementioned issue and further enables applications such as the identification of consortia members in permissioned networks. The system is open and transparent, as the only requirement for usage is ownership of an SSL/TLS-certificate. To enable privacy-preserving authenticated Smart Contracts, we allow one-way and two-way binding between website and contract. Further, low creation and maintenance costs, a widely accepted public key infrastructure and user empowerment will drive potential adaption of Ethereum Authenticated Smart Contracts (AuthSC).",

    "abstract": "By adding users as a new dimension to connectivity, on-body Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices have gained considerable momentum in recent years, while raising serious privacy and safety issues. Existing approaches to authenticate these devices limit themselves to dedicated sensors or specified user motions, undermining their widespread acceptance. This paper overcomes these limitations with a general authentication solution by integrating wireless physical layer (PHY) signatures with upper-layer protocols. The key enabling techniques are constructing representative radio propagation profiles from received signals, and developing an adversarial multi-player neural network to accurately recognize underlying radio propagation patterns and facilitate on-body device authentication. Once hearing a suspicious transmission, our system triggers a PHY-based challenge-response protocol to defend in depth against active attacks. We prove that at equilibrium, our adversarial model can extract all information about propagation patterns and eliminate any irrelevant information caused by motion variances and environment changes. We build a prototype of our system using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices and conduct extensive experiments with various static and dynamic body motions in typical indoor and outdoor environments. The experimental results show that our system achieves an average authentication accuracy of 91.6%, with a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.96 and a better generalization performance compared with the conventional non-adversarial approach.",

    "abstract": "Modern browsers give access to several attributes that can be collected to form a browser fingerprint. Although browser fingerprints have primarily been studied as a web tracking tool, they can contribute to improve the current state of web security by augmenting web authentication mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the adequacy of browser fingerprints for web authentication. We make the link between the digital fingerprints that distinguish browsers, and the biological fingerprints that distinguish Humans, to evaluate browser fingerprints according to properties inspired by biometric authentication factors. These properties include their distinctiveness, their stability through time, their collection time, their size, and the accuracy of a simple verification mechanism. We assess these properties on a large-scale dataset of 4,145,408 fingerprints composed of 216 attributes, and collected from 1,989,365 browsers. We show that, by time-partitioning our dataset, more than 81.3% of our fingerprints are shared by a single browser. Although browser fingerprints are known to evolve, an average of 91% of the attributes of our fingerprints stay identical between two observations, even when separated by nearly 6 months. About their performance, we show that our fingerprints weigh a dozen of kilobytes, and take a few seconds to collect. Finally, by processing a simple verification mechanism, we show that it achieves an equal error rate of 0.61%. We enrich our results with the analysis of the correlation between the attributes, and of their contribution to the evaluated properties. We conclude that our browser fingerprints carry the promise to strengthen web authentication mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Authentication is a critical security feature for confirming the identity of a system's users, typically implemented with help from frameworks like Spring Security. It is a complex feature which should be robustly tested at all stages of development. Unit testing is an effective technique for fine-grained verification of feature behaviors that is not widely-used to test authentication. Part of the problem is that resources to help developers unit test security features are limited. Most security testing guides recommend test cases in a \"black box\" or penetration testing perspective. These resources are not easily applicable to developers writing new unit tests, or who want a security-focused perspective on coverage. In this paper, we address these issues by applying a grounded theory-based approach to identify common (unit) test cases for token authentication through analysis of 481 JUnit tests exercising Spring Security-based authentication implementations from 53 open source Java projects. The outcome of this study is a developer-friendly unit testing guide organized as a catalog of 53 test cases for token authentication, representing unique combinations of 17 scenarios, 40 conditions, and 30 expected outcomes learned from the data set in our analysis. We supplement the test guide with common test smells to avoid. To verify the accuracy and usefulness of our testing guide, we sought feedback from selected developers, some of whom authored unit tests in our dataset.",

    "abstract": "Authentication is the task of confirming the matching relationship between a data instance and a given identity. Typical examples of authentication problems include face recognition and person re-identification. Data-driven authentication could be affected by undesired biases, i.e., the models are often trained in one domain (e.g., for people wearing spring outfits) while applied in other domains (e.g., they change the clothes to summer outfits). Previous works have made efforts to eliminate domain-difference. They typically assume domain annotations are provided, and all the domains share classes. However, for authentication, there could be a large number of domains shared by different identities/classes, and it is impossible to annotate these domains exhaustively. It could make domain-difference challenging to model and eliminate. In this paper, we propose a domain-agnostic method that eliminates domain-difference without domain labels. We alternately perform latent domain discovery and domain-difference elimination until our model no longer detects domain-difference. In our approach, the latent domains are discovered by learning the heterogeneous predictive relationships between inputs and outputs. Then domain-difference is eliminated in both class-dependent and class-independent spaces to improve robustness of elimination. We further extend our method to a meta-learning framework to pursue more thorough domain-difference elimination. Comprehensive empirical evaluation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.",

While HMMs were originally developed and widely used in speech recognition, they have shown great performance in human motion and activity modeling. We make an analogy between human language and teleoperated robotic processes (i.e. words are analogous to a teleoperator's gestures, sentences are analogous to the entire teleoperated task or process) and implement HMMs to model the teleoperated task. To test the continuous authentication performance of the proposed method, we conducted two sets of analyses. We built a virtual reality (VR) experimental environment using a commodity VR headset (HTC Vive) and haptic feedback enabled controller (Sensable PHANToM Omni) to simulate a real teleoperated task. An experimental study with 10 subjects was then conducted. We also performed simulated continuous operator authentication by using the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS). The performance of the model was evaluated based on the continuous (real-time) operator authentication accuracy as well as resistance to a simulated impersonation attack. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to achieve 70% (VR experiment) and 81% (JIGSAW dataset) continuous classification accuracy with as short as a 1-second sample window. It is also capable of detecting the impersonation attack in real-time.",

We proposed a security model that consists of the server and mobile devices in order to realize these security features. In this model we defined the secure communication protocol for the authentication and management of data encryption keys using a private key encryption algorithm with the public key between the server and mobile devices. In addition, we was performed the analysis for the attack to the communication protocol between the mobile device and server. Using the communication protocol, the system will attempt to authenticate the mobile device. The data decrypt key is transmitted only if the authentication process is successful. The data in the mobile device can be decrypted using the key. Our analysis proved that this Protocol ensures anonymity, prevents replay attacks and realizes the interactive identification between the security devices and the authentication server.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Hand Movement, Orientation, and Grasp (HMOG), a set of behavioral features to continuously authenticate smartphone users. HMOG features unobtrusively capture subtle micro-movement and orientation dynamics resulting from how a user grasps, holds, and taps on the smartphone. We evaluated authentication and biometric key generation (BKG) performance of HMOG features on data collected from 100 subjects typing on a virtual keyboard. Data was collected under two conditions: sitting and walking. We achieved authentication EERs as low as 7.16% (walking) and 10.05% (sitting) when we combined HMOG, tap, and keystroke features. We performed experiments to investigate why HMOG features perform well during walking. Our results suggest that this is due to the ability of HMOG features to capture distinctive body movements caused by walking, in addition to the hand-movement dynamics from taps. With BKG, we achieved EERs of 15.1% using HMOG combined with taps. In comparison, BKG using tap, key hold, and swipe features had EERs between 25.7% and 34.2%. We also analyzed the energy consumption of HMOG feature extraction and computation. Our analysis shows that HMOG features extracted at 16Hz sensor sampling rate incurred a minor overhead of 7.9% without sacrificing authentication accuracy. Two points distinguish our work from current literature: 1) we present the results of a comprehensive evaluation of three types of features (HMOG, keystroke, and tap) and their combinations under the same experimental conditions, and 2) we analyze the features from three perspectives (authentication, BKG, and energy consumption on smartphones).",

    "abstract": "An adversary who has obtained the cryptographic hash of a user's password can mount an offline attack to crack the password by comparing this hash value with the cryptographic hashes of likely password guesses. This offline attacker is limited only by the resources he is willing to invest to crack the password. Key-stretching tools can help mitigate the threat of offline attacks by making each password guess more expensive for the adversary to verify. However, key-stretching increases authentication costs for a legitimate authentication server. We introduce a novel Stackelberg game model which captures the essential elements of this interaction between a defender and an offline attacker. We then introduce Cost Asymmetric Secure Hash (CASH), a randomized key-stretching mechanism that minimizes the fraction of passwords that would be cracked by a rational offline attacker without increasing amortized authentication costs for the legitimate authentication server. CASH is motivated by the observation that the legitimate authentication server will typically run the authentication procedure to verify a correct password, while an offline adversary will typically use incorrect password guesses. By using randomization we can ensure that the amortized cost of running CASH to verify a correct password guess is significantly smaller than the cost of rejecting an incorrect password. Using our Stackelberg game framework we can quantify the quality of the underlying CASH running time distribution in terms of the fraction of passwords that a rational offline adversary would crack. We provide an efficient algorithm to compute high quality CASH distributions for the defender. Finally, we analyze CASH using empirical data from two large scale password frequency datasets. Our analysis shows that CASH can significantly reduce (up to $50\\%$) the fraction of password cracked by a rational offline adversary.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 15 years, researchers have identified an increasing number of security mechanisms that are so unusable that the intended users either circumvent them or give up on a service rather than suffer the security. With hindsight, the reasons can be identified easily enough: either the security task itself is too cumbersome and/or time-consuming, or it creates high friction with the users` primary task. The aim of the research presented here is to equip designers who select and implement security mechanisms with a method for identifying the ``best fit`` security mechanism at the design stage. Since many usability problems have been identified with authentication, we focus on ``best fit`` authentication, and present a framework that allows security designers not only to model the workload associated with a particular authentication method, but more importantly to model it in the context of the user`s primary task. We draw on results from cognitive psychology to create a method that allows a designer to understand the impact of a particular authentication method on user productivity and satisfaction. In a validation study using a physical mockup of an airline check-in kiosk, we demonstrate that the model can predict user performance and satisfaction. Furthermore, design experts suggested personalized order recommendations which were similar to our model`s predictions. Our model is the first that supports identification of a holistic fit between the task of user authentication and the context in which it is performed. When applied to new systems, we believe it will help designers understand the usability impact of their security choices and thus develop solutions that maximize both.",

    "abstract": "Secure signal authentication is arguably one of the most challenging problems in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, due to the large-scale nature of the system and its susceptibility to man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks. In this paper, a novel deep learning method is proposed for dynamic authentication of IoT signals to detect cyber attacks. The proposed learning framework, based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure, enables the IoT devices (IoTDs) to extract a set of stochastic features from their generated signal and dynamically watermark these features into the signal. This method enables the cloud, which collects signals from the IoT devices, to effectively authenticate the reliability of the signals. Moreover, in massive IoT scenarios, since the cloud cannot authenticate all the IoTDs simultaneously due to computational limitations, a game-theoretic framework is proposed to improve the cloud's decision making process by predicting vulnerable IoTDs. The mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE) for this game is derived and the uniqueness of the expected utility at the equilibrium is proven. In the massive IoT system, due to a large set of available actions for the cloud, it is shown that analytically deriving the MSNE is challenging and, thus, a learning algorithm proposed that converges to the MSNE. Moreover, in order to cope with the incomplete information case in which the cloud cannot access the state of the unauthenticated IoTDs, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to dynamically predict the state of unauthenticated IoTDs and allow the cloud to decide on which IoTDs to authenticate. Simulation results show that, with an attack detection delay of under 1 second the messages can be transmitted from IoT devices with an almost 100% reliability.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Biometric authentication systems, based on secret key generation, work as follows. In the enrollment stage, an individual provides a biometric signal that is mapped into a secret key and a helper message, the former being prepared to become available to the system at a later time (for authentication), and the latter is stored in a public database. When an authorized user requests authentication, claiming his/her identity as one of the subscribers, he/she has to provide a biometric signal again, and then the system, which retrieves also the helper message of the claimed subscriber, produces an estimate of the secret key, that is finally compared to the secret key of the claimed user. In case of a match, the authentication request is approved, otherwise, it is rejected. Evidently, there is an inherent tension between two desired, but conflicting, properties of the helper message encoder: on the one hand, the encoding should be informative enough concerning the identity of the real subscriber, in order to approve him/her in the authentication stage, but on the other hand, it should not be too informative, as otherwise, unauthorized imposters could easily fool the system and gain access. A good encoder should then trade off the two kinds of errors: the false reject (FR) error and the false accept (FA) error. In this work, we investigate trade-offs between the random coding FR error exponent and the best achievable FA error exponent. We compare two types of ensembles of codes: fixed-rate codes and variable-rate codes, and we show that the latter class of codes offers considerable improvement compared to the former. In doing this, we characterize the optimal rate functions for both types of codes. We also examine privacy leakage constraints for both fixed-rate codes and variable-rate codes.",

    "abstract": "The development in the area of wireless communication, mobile and embedded computing leads to significant changes in the application of devices. Over the last years, embedded devices were brought into the consumer area creating the Internet of Things. Furthermore, industrial applications increasingly rely on communication through trust boundaries. Networking is cheap and easily applicable while providing the possibility to make everyday life more easy and comfortable and industry more efficient and less time-consuming. One of the crucial parts of this interconnected world is sound and secure authentication of entities. Only entities with valid authorisation should be enabled to act on a resource according to an access control scheme. An overview of challenges and practices of authentication is provided in this work, with a special focus on context information as part of security solutions. It can be used for authentication and security solutions in industrial applications. Additional information about events in networks can aid intrusion detection, especially in combination with security information and event management systems. Finally, an authentication and access control approach, based on context information and - depending on the scenario - multiple factors is presented. The combination of multiple factors with context information makes it secure and at the same time case adaptive, so that the effort always matches, but never exceeds, the security demand. This is a common issue of standard cyber security, entities having to obey strict, inflexible and unhandy policies. This approach has been implemented exemplary based on RADIUS. Different scenarios were considered, showing that this approach is capable of providing flexible and scalable security for authentication processes.",

    "abstract": "Code reuse attacks are still big threats to software and system security. Control flow integrity is a promising technique to defend against such attacks. However, its effectiveness has been weakened due to the inaccurate control flow graph and practical strategy to trade security for performance. In recent years, CPU vendors have integrated hardware features as countermeasures. For instance, ARM Pointer Authentication (PA in short) was introduced in ARMV8-A architecture. It can efficiently generate an authentication code for an address, which is encoded in the unused bits of the address. When the address is de-referenced, the authentication code is checked to ensure its integrity. Though there exist systems that adopt PA to harden user programs, how to effectively use PA to protect OS kernels is still an open research question. In this paper, we shed lights on how to leverage PA to protect control flows, including function pointers and return addresses, of Linux kernel. Specifically, to protect function pointers, we embed authentication code into them, track their propagation and verify their values when loading from memory or branching to targets. To further defend against the pointer substitution attack, we use the function pointer address as its context, and take a clean design to propagate the address by piggybacking it into the pointer value. We have implemented a prototype system with LLVM to identify function pointers, add authentication code and verify function pointers by emitting new machine instructions. We applied this system to Linux kernel, and solved numerous practical issues, e.g., function pointer comparison and arithmetic operations. The security analysis shows that our system can protect all function pointers and return addresses in Linux kernel.",

He then uses the verification key to check whether the ciphertext is malformed. The authors did not consider that information delivered over a channel, especially over a broadcast channel, should be authenticated as to its origin. We remark that the conventional public key signature suffices to authenticate data origin and filter out all malformed ciphertexts.

    "abstract": "Most user authentication methods and identity proving systems rely on a centralized database. Such information storage presents a single point of compromise from a security perspective. If this system is compromised it poses a direct threat to users' digital identities. This paper proposes a decentralized authentication method, called the Horcrux protocol, in which there is no such single point of compromise. The protocol relies on decentralized identifiers (DIDs) under development by the W3C Verifiable Claims Community Group and the concept of self-sovereign identity. To accomplish this, we propose specification and implementation of a decentralized biometric credential storage option via blockchains using DIDs and DID documents within the IEEE 2410-2017 Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS).",

To this end, we introduce and study the concept of a unique-neighborhood network, in which nodes are uniquely identifiable upon their graph-topological neighborhood. While the concept is motivated by authentication, it may enjoy wider applicability as being a technology-agnostic (yet topology aware) form of addressing nodes in a network.",

However, its natural advantages of networking in civilian and military environments make them vulnerable to security threats. Support for an anonymity in MANET is an orthogonal to security critical challenge we faced in this paper. We propose a new anonymous authentication protocol for mobile ad hoc networks enhanced with a distributed reputation system. The main its objective is to provide mechanisms concealing a real identity of communicating nodes with an ability of resist to known attacks. The distributed reputation system is incorporated for a trust management and malicious behavior detection in the network. The end-to-end anonymous authentication is conducted in three-pass handshake based on an asymmetric and symmetric key cryptography. After successfully finished authentication phase secure and multiple anonymous data channels are established. The anonymity is guarantied by randomly chosen pseudonyms owned by a user. Nodes of the network are publicly identified and are independent of users' pseudonyms. In this paper we presented an example of the protocol implementation.",

We consider the size of the one-time pad that is needed to protect quantum information in a number of cases. The situation is dramatically different from the classical case: we prove that one can recycle the one-time pad without compromising security. The protocol for recycling relies on detecting whether eavesdropping has occurred, and further relies on the fact that information contained in the encrypted quantum state cannot be fully accessed. We prove the security of recycling rates when authentication of quantum states is accepted, and when it is rejected. We note that recycling schemes respect a general law of cryptography which we prove relating the size of private keys, sent qubits, and encrypted messages. We discuss applications for encryption of quantum information in light of the resources needed for teleportation. Potential uses include the protection of resources such as entanglement and the memory of quantum computers. We also introduce another application: encrypted secret sharing and find that one can even reuse the private key that is used to encrypt a classical message. In a number of cases, one finds that the amount of private key needed for authentication or protection is smaller than in the general case.",

    "abstract": "Traditional password based authentication schemes are mostly considered in single server environments. They are unfitted for the multi-server environments from two aspects. On the one hand, users need to register in each server and to store large sets of data, including identities and passwords. On the other hand, servers are required to store a verification table containing user identities and passwords. Recently, On the base on Sood et al.'s protocol(2011), Li et al. proposed an improved dynamic identity based authentication and key agreement protocol for multi-server architecture(2012). Li et al. claims that the proposed scheme can make up the security weaknesses of Sood et al.'s protocol. Unfortunately, our further research shows that Li et al.'s protocol contains several drawbacks and can not resist some types of known attacks, such as replay attack, Deny-of-Service attack, internal attack, eavesdropping attack, masquerade attack, and so on. In this paper, we further propose a light dynamic pseudonym identity based authentication and key agreement protocol for multi-server architecture. In our scheme, service providing servers don't need to maintain verification tables for users. The proposed protocol provides not only the declared security features in Li et al.'s paper, but also some other security features, such as traceability and identity protection.",

    "abstract": "Privacy preserving RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) authentication has been an active research area in recent years. Both forward security and backward security are required to maintain the privacy of a tag, i.e., exposure of a tag's secret key should not reveal the past or future secret keys of the tag. We envisage the need for a formal model for backward security for RFID protocol designs in shared key settings, since the RFID tags are too resource-constrained to support public key settings. However, there has not been much research on backward security for shared key environment since Serge Vaudenay in his Asiacrypt 2007 paper showed that perfect backward security is impossible to achieve without public key settings. We propose a Privacy Preserving RFID Authentication Protocol for shared key environment, APRAP, which minimizes the damage caused by secret key exposure using insulated keys. Even if a tag's secret key is exposed during an authentication session, forward security and 'restricted' backward security of the tag are preserved under our assumptions. The notion of 'restricted' backward security is that the adversary misses the protocol transcripts which are needed to update the compromised secret key. Although our definition does not capture perfect backward security, it is still suitable for effective implementation as the tags are highly mobile in practice. We also provide a formal security model of APRAP. Our scheme is more efficient than previous proposals from the viewpoint of computational requirements.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we construct an authentication scheme for multi-receivers and multiple messages based on a linear code $C$. This construction can be regarded as a generalization of the authentication scheme given by Safavi-Naini and Wang. Actually, we notice that the scheme of Safavi-Naini and Wang is constructed with Reed-Solomon codes. The generalization to linear codes has the similar advantages as generalizing Shamir's secret sharing scheme to linear secret sharing sceme based on linear codes. For a fixed message base field $\\f$, our scheme allows arbitrarily many receivers to check the integrity of their own messages, while the scheme of Safavi-Naini and Wang has a constraint on the number of verifying receivers $V\\leqslant q$. And we introduce access structure in our scheme. Massey characterized the access structure of linear secret sharing scheme by minimal codewords in the dual code whose first component is 1. We slightly modify the definition of minimal codewords in \\cite{Massey93}. Let $C$ be a $[V,k]$ linear code. For any coordinate $i\\in \\{1,2,\\cdots,V\\}$, a codeword $\\vec{c}$ in $C$ is called minimal respect to $i$ if the codeword $\\vec{c}$ has component 1 at the $i$-th coordinate and there is no other codeword whose $i$-th component is 1 with support strictly contained in that of $\\vec{c}$. Then the security of receiver $R_i$ in our authentication scheme is characterized by the minimal codewords respect to $i$ in the dual code $C^\\bot$.",

    "abstract": "Biometrics authentication is an effective method for automatically recognizing individuals. The authentication consists of an enrollment phase and an identification or verification phase. In the stages of enrollment known (training) samples after the pre-processing stage are used for suitable feature extraction to generate the template database. In the verification stage, the test sample is similarly pre processed and subjected to feature extraction modules, and then it is matched with the training feature templates to decide whether it is a genuine or not. This paper presents use of a region of interest (ROI) for palm print technology. First some of the existing methods for palm print identification have been introduced. Then focus has been given on extraction of a suitable smaller region from the acquired palm print to improve the identification method accuracy. Several existing work in the topic of region extraction have been examined. Subsequently, a simple and original method has then proposed for locating the ROI that can be effectively used for palm print analysis. The ROI extracted using this new technique is suitable for different types of processing as it creates a rectangular or square area around the center of activity represented by the lines, wrinkles and ridges of the palm print. The effectiveness of the ROI approach has been tested by integrating it with a texture based identification / authentication system proposed earlier. The improvement has been shown by comparing the identification accuracy rate before and after the ROI pre-processing.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the security and memorability of free-form multitouch gestures for mobile authentication. Towards this end, we collected a dataset with a generate-test-retest paradigm where participants (N=63) generated free-form gestures, repeated them, and were later retested for memory. Half of the participants decided to generate one-finger gestures, and the other half generated multi-finger gestures. Although there has been recent work on template-based gestures, there are yet no metrics to analyze security of either template or free-form gestures. For example, entropy-based metrics used for text-based passwords are not suitable for capturing the security and memorability of free-form gestures. Hence, we modify a recently proposed metric for analyzing information capacity of continuous full-body movements for this purpose. Our metric computed estimated mutual information in repeated sets of gestures. Surprisingly, one-finger gestures had higher average mutual information. Gestures with many hard angles and turns had the highest mutual information. The best-remembered gestures included signatures and simple angular shapes. We also implemented a multitouch recognizer to evaluate the practicality of free-form gestures in a real authentication system and how they perform against shoulder surfing attacks. We conclude the paper with strategies for generating secure and memorable free-form gestures, which present a robust method for mobile authentication.",

    "abstract": "Users often choose passwords that are easy to remember but also easy to guess by attackers. Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of textual passwords to shoulder surfing and keystroke loggers. It remains a critical challenge in password research to develop an authentication scheme that addresses these security issues, in addition to offering good memorability. Motivated by psychology research on humans' cognitive strengths and weaknesses, we explore the potential of cognitive questions as a way to address the major challenges in user authentication. We design, implement, and evaluate Q-A, a novel cognitive-question-based password system that requires a user to enter the letter at a given position in her answer for each of six personal questions (e.g. \"What is the name of your favorite childhood teacher?\"). In this scheme, the user does not need to memorize new, artificial information as her authentication secret. Our scheme offers 28 bits of theoretical password space, which has been found sufficient to prevent online brute-force attacks. Q-A is also robust against shoulder surfing and keystroke loggers. We conducted a multi-session in-lab user study to evaluate the usability of Q-A; 100% of users were able to remember their Q-A password over the span of one week, although login times were high. We compared our scheme with random six character passwords and found that login success rate in Q-A was significantly higher. Based on our results, we suggest that Q-A would be most appropriate in contexts that demand high security and where logins occur infrequently (e.g., online bank accounts).",

We can expect some solutions -- especially those adding a token -- to create extra work for users, but little research has investigated usability, user acceptance, and perceived security of deployed 2FA. This paper presents an in-depth study of 2FA usability with 21 UK online banking customers, 16 of whom had accounts with more than one bank. We collected a rich set of qualitative and quantitative data through two rounds of semi-structured interviews, and an authentication diary over an average of 11 days. Our participants reported a wide range of usability issues, especially with the use of hardware tokens, showing that the mental and physical workload involved shapes how they use online banking. Key targets for improvements are (i) the reduction in the number of authentication steps, and (ii) removing features that do not add any security but negatively affect the user experience.",

    "abstract": "Biometric techniques are often used as an extra security factor in authenticating human users. Numerous biometrics have been proposed and evaluated, each with its own set of benefits and pitfalls. Static biometrics (such as fingerprints) are geared for discrete operation, to identify users, which typically involves some user burden. Meanwhile, behavioral biometrics (such as keystroke dynamics) are well suited for continuous, and sometimes more unobtrusive, operation. One important application domain for biometrics is deauthentication, a means of quickly detecting absence of a previously authenticated user and immediately terminating that user's active secure sessions. Deauthentication is crucial for mitigating so called Lunchtime Attacks, whereby an insider adversary takes over (before any inactivity timeout kicks in) authenticated state of a careless user who walks away from her computer. Motivated primarily by the need for an unobtrusive and continuous biometric to support effective deauthentication, we introduce PoPa, a new hybrid biometric based on a human user's seated posture pattern. PoPa captures a unique combination of physiological and behavioral traits. We describe a low cost fully functioning prototype that involves an office chair instrumented with 16 tiny pressure sensors. We also explore (via user experiments) how PoPa can be used in a typical workplace to provide continuous authentication (and deauthentication) of users. We experimentally assess viability of PoPa in terms of uniqueness by collecting and evaluating posture patterns of a cohort of users. Results show that PoPa exhibits very low false positive, and even lower false negative, rates. In particular, users can be identified with, on average, 91.0% accuracy. Finally, we compare pros and cons of PoPa with those of several prominent biometric based deauthentication techniques.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of shoulder-surfing attacks on authentication schemes by proposing IllusionPIN (IPIN), a PIN-based authentication method that operates on touchscreen devices. IPIN uses the technique of hybrid images to blend two keypads with different digit orderings in such a way, that the user who is close to the device is seeing one keypad to enter her PIN, while the attacker who is looking at the device from a bigger distance is seeing only the other keypad. The user's keypad is shuffled in every authentication attempt since the attacker may memorize the spatial arrangement of the pressed digits. To reason about the security of IllusionPIN, we developed an algorithm which is based on human visual perception and estimates the minimum distance from which an observer is unable to interpret the keypad of the user. We tested our estimations with 84 simulated shoulder-surfing attacks from 21 different people. None of the attacks was successful against our estimations. In addition, we estimated the minimum distance from which a camera is unable to capture the visual information from the keypad of the user. Based on our analysis, it seems practically almost impossible for a surveillance camera to capture the PIN of a smartphone user when IPIN is in use.",

While the research community has investigated solutions to minimize or prevent the threat of shoulder surfing, our understanding of how the attack performs on current systems is less well studied. In this paper, we describe a large online experiment (n=1173) that works towards establishing a baseline of shoulder surfing vulnerability for current unlock authentication systems. Using controlled video recordings of a victim entering in a set of 4- and 6-length PINs and Android unlock patterns on different phones from different angles, we asked participants to act as attackers, trying to determine the authentication input based on the observation. We find that 6-digit PINs are the most elusive attacking surface where a single observation leads to just 10.8% successful attacks, improving to 26.5\\% with multiple observations. As a comparison, 6-length Android patterns, with one observation, suffered 64.2% attack rate and 79.9% with multiple observations. Removing feedback lines for patterns improves security from 35.3\\% and 52.1\\% for single and multiple observations, respectively. This evidence, as well as other results related to hand position, phone size, and observation angle, suggests the best and worst case scenarios related to shoulder surfing vulnerability which can both help inform users to improve their security choices, as well as establish baselines for researchers.",

    "abstract": "With the growing use of underwater acoustic communications (UWAC) for both industrial and military operations, there is a need to ensure communication security. A particular challenge is represented by underwater acoustic networks (UWANs), which are often left unattended over long periods of time. Currently, due to physical and performance limitations, UWAC packets rarely include encryption, leaving the UWAN exposed to external attacks faking legitimate messages. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for message authentication in a UWAN setting. We begin by observing that, due to the strong spatial dependency of the underwater acoustic channel, an attacker can attempt to mimic the channel associated with the legitimate transmitter only for a small set of receivers, typically just for a single one. Taking this into account, our scheme relies on trusted nodes that independently help a sink node in the authentication process. For each incoming packet, the sink fuses beliefs evaluated by the trusted nodes to reach an authentication decision. These beliefs are based on estimated statistical channel parameters, chosen to be the most sensitive to the transmitter-receiver displacement. Our simulation results show accurate identification of an attacker's packet. We also report results from a sea experiment demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

The authentication strength of the SemanticLock is based on the large number of possible semantic constructs derived from the positioning of the image tokens and the type of images selected. Semantic Lock has a high resistance to smudge attacks and it equally exhibits a higher level of memorability due to its graphical paradigm. In a three weeks user study with 21 participants comparing SemanticLock against other authentication systems, we discovered that SemanticLock outperformed the PIN and matched the PATTERN both on speed, memorability, user acceptance and usability. Furthermore, qualitative test also show that SemanticLock was rated more superior in like-ability. SemanticLock was also evaluated while participants walked unencumbered and walked encumbered carrying \"everyday\" items to analyze the effects of such activities on its usage.",

Autocrypt is a new community-driven open specification for e-mail encryption that attempts to respond to this demand. In Autocrypt the encryption keys are attached directly to messages, and thus the encryption can be implemented by email clients without any collaboration of the providers. The decentralized nature of this in-band key distribution, however, makes it prone to man-in-the-middle attacks and can leak the social graph of users. To address this problem we introduce ClaimChain, a cryptographic construction for privacy-preserving authentication of public keys. Users store claims about their identities and keys, as well as their beliefs about others, in ClaimChains. These chains form authenticated decentralized repositories that enable users to prove the authenticity of both their keys and the keys of their contacts. ClaimChains are encrypted, and therefore protect the stored information, such as keys and contact identities, from prying eyes. At the same time, ClaimChain implements mechanisms to provide strong non-equivocation properties, discouraging malicious actors from distributing conflicting or inauthentic claims. We implemented ClaimChain and we show that it offers reasonable performance, low overhead, and authenticity guarantees.",

    "abstract": "Face authentication systems are becoming increasingly prevalent, especially with the rapid development of Deep Learning technologies. However, human facial information is easy to be captured and reproduced, which makes face authentication systems vulnerable to various attacks. Liveness detection is an important defense technique to prevent such attacks, but existing solutions did not provide clear and strong security guarantees, especially in terms of time. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new liveness detection protocol called Face Flashing that significantly increases the bar for launching successful attacks on face authentication systems. By randomly flashing well-designed pictures on a screen and analyzing the reflected light, our protocol has leveraged physical characteristics of human faces: reflection processing at the speed of light, unique textual features, and uneven 3D shapes. Cooperating with working mechanism of the screen and digital cameras, our protocol is able to detect subtle traces left by an attacking process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Face Flashing, we implemented a prototype and performed thorough evaluations with large data set collected from real-world scenarios. The results show that our Timing Verification can effectively detect the time gap between legitimate authentications and malicious cases. Our Face Verification can also differentiate 2D plane from 3D objects accurately. The overall accuracy of our liveness detection system is 98.8\\%, and its robustness was evaluated in different scenarios. In the worst case, our system's accuracy decreased to a still-high 97.3\\%.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we examine the ways in which user attitudes towards privacy and security relating to mobile devices and the data stored thereon may impact the strength of unlock authentication, focusing on Android's graphical unlock patterns. We conducted an online study with Amazon Mechanical Turk ($N=750$) using self-reported unlock authentication choices, as well as Likert scale agreement/disagreement responses to a set of seven privacy/security prompts. We then analyzed the responses in multiple dimensions, including a straight average of the Likert responses as well as using Principle Component Analysis to expose latent factors. We found that responses to two of the seven questions proved relevant and significant. These two questions considered attitudes towards general concern for data stored on mobile devices, and attitudes towards concerns for unauthorized access by known actors. Unfortunately, larger conclusions cannot be drawn on the efficacy of the broader set of questions for exposing connections between unlock authentication strength (Pearson Rank $r=-0.08$, $p<0.1$). However, both of our factor solutions exposed differences in responses for demographics groups, including age, gender, and residence type. The findings of this study suggests that there is likely a link between perceptions of privacy/security on mobile devices and the perceived threats therein, but more research is needed, particularly on developing better survey and measurement techniques of privacy/security attitudes that relate to mobile devices specifically.",

    "abstract": "Passwords are ubiquitous and most commonly used to authenticate users when logging into online services. Using high entropy passwords is critical to prevent unauthorized access and password policies emerged to enforce this requirement on passwords. However, with current methods of password storage, poor practices and server breaches have leaked many passwords to the public. To protect one's sensitive information in case of such events, passwords should be hidden from servers. Verifier-based password authenticated key exchange, proposed by Bellovin and Merrit (IEEE S\\&P, 1992), allows authenticated secure channels to be established with a hash of a password (verifier). Unfortunately, this restricts password policies as passwords cannot be checked from their verifier. To address this issue, Kiefer and Manulis (ESORICS 2014) proposed zero-knowledge password policy check (ZKPPC). A ZKPPC protocol allows users to prove in zero knowledge that a hash of the user's password satisfies the password policy required by the server. Unfortunately, their proposal is not quantum resistant with the use of discrete logarithm-based cryptographic tools and there are currently no other viable alternatives. In this work, we construct the first post-quantum ZKPPC using lattice-based tools. To this end, we introduce a new randomised password hashing scheme for ASCII-based passwords and design an accompanying zero-knowledge protocol for policy compliance. Interestingly, our proposal does not follow the framework established by Kiefer and Manulis and offers an alternate construction without homomorphic commitments. Although our protocol is not ready to be used in practice, we think it is an important first step towards a quantum-resistant privacy-preserving password-based authentication and key exchange system.",

It is vulnerable to several security attacks such as the replay attack, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks at sink and redundancy information crack. However, BANZKP needs an end-to-end authentication which is not compliant with the human body postural mobility. We propose a new scheme BAN-GZKP. Our scheme improves both the security and postural mobility resilience of BANZKP. Moreover, BAN-GZKP uses only a three-phase authentication which is optimal in the class of ZKP protocols. To fix the security vulnerabilities of BANZKP, BAN-GZKP uses a novel random key allocation and a Hop-by-Hop authentication definition. We further prove the reliability of our scheme to various attacks including those to which BANZKP is vulnerable. Furthermore, via extensive simulations we prove that our scheme, BAN-GZKP, outperforms BANZKP in terms of reliability to human body postural mobility for various network parameters (end-to-end delay, number of packets exchanged in the network, number of transmissions). We compared both schemes using representative convergecast strategies with various transmission rates and human postural mobility. Finally, it is important to mention that BAN-GZKP has no additional cost compared to BANZKP in terms memory, computational complexity or energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "Applications using gesture-based human-computer interface require a new user login method with gestures because it does not have a traditional input method to type a password. However, due to various challenges, existing gesture-based authentication systems are generally considered too weak to be useful in practice. In this paper, we propose a unified user login framework using 3D in-air-handwriting, called FMCode. We define new types of features critical to distinguish legitimate users from attackers and utilize Support Vector Machine (SVM) for user authentication. The features and data-driven models are specially designed to accommodate minor behavior variations that existing gesture authentication methods neglect. In addition, we use deep neural network approaches to efficiently identify the user based on his or her in-air-handwriting, which avoids expansive account database search methods employed by existing work. On a dataset collected by us with over 100 users, our prototype system achieves 0.1% and 0.5% best Equal Error Rate (EER) for user authentication, as well as 96.7% and 94.3% accuracy for user identification, using two types of gesture input devices. Compared to existing behavioral biometric systems using gesture and in-air-handwriting, our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance. In addition, our experimental results show that FMCode is capable to defend against client-side spoofing attacks, and it performs persistently in the long run. These results and discoveries pave the way to practical usage of gesture-based user login over the gesture interface.",

    "abstract": "As a popular application, mobile crowd sensing systems aim at providing more convenient service via the swarm intelligence. With the popularity of sensor-embedded smart phones and intelligent wearable devices, mobile crowd sensing is becoming an efficient way to obtain various types of sensing data from individuals, which will make people's life more convenient. However, mobile crowd sensing systems today are facing a critical challenge, namely the privacy leakage of the sensitive information and valuable data, which can raise grave concerns among the participants. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced secure certificateless privacy-preserving verifiable data authentication scheme for mobile crowd sensing, named EPDA. The proposed scheme provides unconditional anonymous data authentication service for mobile crowd sensing, by deploying an improved certificateless ring signature as the cryptogram essential, in which the big sensing data should be signed by one of legitimate members in a specific group and could be verified without exposing the actual identity of the participant. The formal security proof demonstrates that EPDA is secure against existential forgery under adaptive chosen message and identity attacks in random oracle model. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted. The results show that the proposed EPDA efficiently decreases computational cost and time consumption in the sensing data authentication process.",

Much literature examined either the usability or security of a handful of gestures. This paper aims at quantifying usability and security of gestures as well as understanding their relationship across multiple gestures. To study gesture-based authentication, we design an authentication method that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and conducted a user study with 42 participants over a period of 6 weeks. We objectively quantify the usability of a gesture by the number of corners and the frame length of all gesture samples, quantify the security using the equal error rate (EER), and the consistency by EER over a period of time. Meanwhile, we obtain subjective evaluation of usability and security by conducting a survey. By examining the responses, we found that the subjective evaluation confirms with the objective ones, and usability is in inverse relationship with security. We studied the consistency of gestures and found that most participants forgot gestures to some degree and reinforcing the memorization of gestures is necessary to improve the authentication performance. Finally, we performed a study with another 17 participants on shoulder surfing attacks, where attackers can observe the victims multiple times. The results show that shoulder surfing does not help to boost the attacks.",

    "abstract": "Mobile and embedded devices are becoming inevitable parts of our daily routine. Similar to other electronic devices such as read access memory (RAM) and storage, mobile devices require to authenticate and to be authenticated in a secure way. Usually, this can be accomplished by servers which possess private information for all devices. Since these devices are inherently mobile and operating in untrusted environments, they are prone to be accessed by untrustworthy users. Physical unclonable function (PUF) is a unique physical feature of a semiconductor device such as a microprocessor that can be generated from physical conditions such as supply voltage, temperature, etc. Ring oscillators are the principal parts of PUFs that are synthesized on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Password manager systems are used in order to keep a database of usernames and password for clients in order for registration and authentication. This table plays a crucial role in authentication in many systems. Hence, security is one of the important features of these systems. Normally, in these tables only usernames and passwords are stored; however, they are vulnerable to many attacks. So, the first method of enhancing the security is using the hash instead of the original data, but, advanced hackers can break these hash data again. Hence, the method that we are going to use in this project is utilizing PUF to store the challenge of each user instead of saving the hash of passwords.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal deep hashing neural decoder (MDHND) architecture, which integrates a deep hashing framework with a neural network decoder (NND) to create an effective multibiometric authentication system. The MDHND consists of two separate modules: a multimodal deep hashing (MDH) module, which is used for feature-level fusion and binarization of multiple biometrics, and a neural network decoder (NND) module, which is used to refine the intermediate binary codes generated by the MDH and compensate for the difference between enrollment and probe biometrics (variations in pose, illumination, etc.). Use of NND helps to improve the performance of the overall multimodal authentication system. The MDHND framework is trained in 3 steps using joint optimization of the two modules. In Step 1, the MDH parameters are trained and learned to generate a shared multimodal latent code; in Step 2, the latent codes from Step 1 are passed through a conventional error-correcting code (ECC) decoder to generate the ground truth to train a neural network decoder (NND); in Step 3, the NND decoder is trained using the ground truth from Step 2 and the MDH and NND are jointly optimized. Experimental results on a standard multimodal dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method relative to other current multimodal authentication systems",

This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first work that proposes a novel authentication scheme involving DRAM power-up unique features using deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which can be used to implement secure access control of autonomous vehicles. Our approach consists of two parts. First, we convert raw power-up sequence data from DRAM cells into a two-dimensional (2D) format to generate a DRAM image structure. Second, we apply deep CNN to DRAM images, in order to extract unique features from each memory to classify them for authentication. To evaluate our proposed approach, we utilize data from three Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) DRAMs taken under various environmental and other conditions (high/low temperature, high/low supply voltage and aging effects). Based on our results, our proposed authentication method ``DRAMNet'' achieves 98.63% accuracy and 98.49% precision. In comparison to other state-of-the-art CNN architectures, such as the AlexNet and VGGNet models, our DRAMNet approach fares equally well or better than them.",

This approach completely voids session hijacking for the mqtt protocol and provides authenticity without the need for any network-security nor channel-security nor broker-based predefined ACLs. The presented approach does not require the broker to keep any secrets for session handling, what so ever. Moreover, it allows the clientID, which represents the identification for a session, to be publicly known. The presented approach allows completely anonymous but authentic sessions, hence the broker does not need any a priori knowledge of the client-party. As it is especially targeted for applications within the world of IoT, the presented approach is tuned to require only the minimum in extra power in terms of energy and space. The approach does not introduce any new concept, but simply fusions a state-of-the-art cryptographic zero knowledge proof of identity with the existing MQTT-5 specification. Thus no protocol extension is required in order to provide the targeted security properties. The described approach is completely agnostic to the application layer at the client side and is only required during mqtt-session establishment.",

    "abstract": "Smart metering infrastructure (SMI) is the core component of the smart grid (SG) which enables two-way communication between consumers and utility companies to control, monitor, and manage the energy consumption data. Despite their salient features, SMIs equipped with information and communication technology are associated with new threats due to their dependency on public communication networks. Therefore, the security of SMI communications raises the need for robust authentication and key agreement primitives that can satisfy the security requirements of the SG. Thus, in order to realize the aforementioned issues, this paper introduces a lightweight and secure authentication protocol, \"LiSA\", primarily to secure SMIs in SG setups. The protocol employs Elliptic Curve Cryptography at its core to provide various security features such as mutual authentication, anonymity, replay protection, session key security, and resistance against various attacks. Precisely, LiSA exploits the hardness of the Elliptic Curve Qu Vanstone (EVQV) certificate mechanism along with Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman Problem (ECDHP) and Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). Additionally, LiSA is designed to provide the highest level of security relative to the existing schemes with least computational and communicational overheads. For instance, LiSA incurred barely 11.826 ms and 0.992 ms for executing different passes across the smart meter and the service providers. Further, it required a total of 544 bits for message transmission during each session.",

    "abstract": "Group oriented applications are getting more and more popular in today's mobile Internet and call for secure and efficient (t,n) threshold secret sharing scheme (or (t,n)-SS) to meet their requirements. A (t,n)-SS divides a secret into $n$ shares such that any $t$ or more than $t$ shares can recover the secret while less than $t$ shares cannot. However, an adversary, even without a valid share, may obtain the secret by mounting Illegal Participant (IP) attack or Half Threshold Channel Cracking (HTCC) attack. Therefore, 1) the paper presents the notion and generic framework of (t,m,n)-Tightly Coupled Secret Sharing ((t,m,n)-TCSS). Prior to recovering the secret, it requires $m$ ($m \\ge t$) participants to form a tightly coupled group by each independently constructing a component with the share. All $m$ components have to be used to recover the secret and thus both attacks can be thwarted more directly and simply. Furthermore, following the framework, threshold changeable secret sharing can also be easily constructed. 2) As an implementation of the framework, a linear code based (t,m,n)-TCSS scheme is proposed. Analyses show that the scheme can prevent IP, HTCC and $(t-1)$-Insider conspiring attacks with asymptotically perfect security. Moreover, it doesn't depend on any computational assumption and is more secure and efficient in storage, communication and computation when compared with related schemes. 3) Based on (t,m,n)-TCSS, a group authentication scheme is constructed, which allows a group user to authenticate whether all users are legal group members at once and thus provides efficient and flexible m-to-m authentication for group oriented applications.",

This technology has enabled household devices to have the ability to communicate with the internet and a network comprising of such device can create a home IoT network. Such IoT devices are resource constrained and lack high-level security protocols. Thus, security becomes a major issue for such network systems. One way to secure the networks is through reliable authentication protocols and data transfer mechanism. As the household devices are controllable by the users remotely, they are accessed over the internet. Therefore, there should also be a method to make the communication over the internet between IoT devices and the users more secured. This paper proposes a two-phase authentication protocol for authentication purposes and a VPN based secure channel creation for the communication of the devices in the network. Furthermore, the paper discusses the Elliptic Curve Cryptography as a viable alternative to RSA for a more efficient Key exchange mechanism for low-powered IoT devices in the network.",

D2D communication aims to improve system spectrum efficiency, overall system throughput, energy efficiency and reduce the connection delay between devices. However, new security threats and challenges need to be considered regarding device and user authentication to avoid unauthorized access, abuse and attacks on the whole system. In this paper, a strong standalone authentication technique therefore is proposed. It is based on combining users biometric identities and a new clone-resistant device identity. The novel property of the proposal is that it is fully independent on both device manufacturer and mobile system operator. The biometric identity deploys user keystroke dynamics and accelerometer to generate user biometric identity by deploying a machine learning technique. The proposed mobile device clone-resistant identity is based on deploying a new concept of a pure digital clone-resistant structure which is both manufacturer and mobile operator-independent. When combining both identities, a mutually authenticated D2D secured link between any two devices can be established in addition to a strong user-device authentication. Furthermore, the concept does not allow the managing trusted authority to intercept users private links. Being an independent and standalone system, the technique would offer a broad spectrum of attractive future smart applications over the 5G mobile system infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we consider authentication at the physical layer, in which the authenticator aims at distinguishing a legitimate supplicant from an attacker on the basis of the characteristics of a set of parallel wireless channels, which are affected by time-varying fading. Moreover, the attacker's channel has a spatial correlation with the supplicant's one. In this setting, we assess and compare the performance achieved by different approaches under different channel conditions. We first consider the use of two different statistical decision methods, and we prove that using a large number of references (in the form of channel estimates) affected by different levels of time-varying fading is not beneficial from a security point of view. We then consider classification methods based on machine learning. In order to face the worst case scenario of an authenticator provided with no forged messages during training, we consider one-class classifiers. When instead the training set includes some forged messages, we resort to more conventional binary classifiers, considering the cases in which such messages are either labelled or not. For the latter case, we exploit clustering algorithms to label the training set. The performance of both nearest neighbor (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) classification techniques is evaluated. Through numerical examples, we show that under the same probability of false alarm, one-class classification (OCC) algorithms achieve the lowest probability of missed detection when a small spatial correlation exists between the main channel and the adversary one, while statistical methods are advantageous when the spatial correlation between the two channels is large.",

    "abstract": "Temporal memory corruptions are commonly exploited software vulnerabilities that can lead to powerful attacks. Despite significant progress made by decades of research on mitigation techniques, existing countermeasures fall short due to either limited coverage or overly high overhead. Furthermore, they require external mechanisms (e.g., spatial memory safety) to protect their metadata. Otherwise, their protection can be bypassed or disabled. To address these limitations, we present robust points-to authentication, a novel runtime scheme for detecting all kinds of temporal memory corruptions. We built a prototype system, called PTAuth, that realizes this scheme on ARM architectures. PTAuth contains a customized compiler for code analysis and instrumentation and a runtime library for performing the points-to authentication as a protected program runs. PTAuth leverages the Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) feature, provided by the ARMv8.3 and later CPUs, which serves as a simple hardware-based encryption primitive. PTAuth uses minimal in-memory metadata and protects its metadata without requiring spatial memory safety. We report our evaluation of PTAuth in terms of security, robustness and performance using 150 vulnerable programs from Juliet test suite and the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks. PTAuth detects all three categories of heap-based temporal memory corruptions, generates zero false alerts, and slows down program execution by 26% (this number was measured based on software-emulated PAC; it is expected to decrease to 20% when using hardware-based PAC). We also show that PTAuth incurs 2% memory overhead thanks to the efficient use of metadata.",

Despite its relevance, the procedures used by RBA-instrumented online services are currently not disclosed. Consequently, there is little scientific research about RBA, slowing down progress and deeper understanding, making it harder for end users to understand the security provided by the services they use and trust, and hindering the widespread adoption of RBA.

    "abstract": "Network-based attacks on control systems may alter sensor data delivered to the controller, effectively causing degradation in control performance. As a result, having access to accurate state estimates, even in the presence of attacks on sensor measurements, is of critical importance. In this paper, we analyze performance of resilient state estimators (RSEs) when any subset of sensors may be compromised by a stealthy attacker. Specifically, we consider systems with the well-known l0-based RSE and two commonly used sound intrusion detectors (IDs). For linear time-invariant plants with bounded noise, we define the notion of perfect attackability (PA) when attacks may result in unbounded estimation errors while remaining undetected by the employed ID (i.e., stealthy). We derive necessary and sufficient PA conditions, showing that a system can be perfectly attackable even if the plant is stable. While PA can be prevented with the use the standard cryptographic mechanisms (e.g.,message authentication) that ensure data integrity under network-based attacks, their continuous use imposes significant communication and computational overhead. Consequently, we also study the impact that even intermittent use of data authentication has on RSE performance guarantees in the presence of stealthy attacks. We show that if messages from some of the sensors are even intermittently authenticated, stealthy attacks could not result in unbounded state estimation errors.",

In touch gesture authentication, a user swipes across the touchscreen of a mobile device to perform an authentication attempt. A key characteristic of touch gesture authentication and new behavioural biometrics in general is the lack of available data to train and validate models. From a machine learning perspective, this presents the classic curse of dimensionality problem and the methodology presented here focuses on Bayesian unsupervised models as they are well suited to such conditions. This paper presents results from a set of experiments consisting of 38 sessions with labelled victim as well as blind and over-the-shoulder presentation attacks. Three models are compared using this dataset; two single-mode models: a shrunk covariance estimate and a Bayesian Gaussian distribution, as well as a Bayesian non-parametric infinite mixture of Gaussians, modelled as a Dirichlet Process. Equal error rates (EER) for the three models are compared and attention is paid to how these vary across the two single-mode models at differing numbers of enrolment samples.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a network infrastructure of identifiable things that share data through the Internet. A smart home is one of the applications for the Internet of Things. In a smart home, household appliances could be monitored and controlled remotely. This raises a demand for reliable security solutions for IoT systems. Authorization and authentication are challenging IoT security operations that need to be considered. For instance, unauthorized access, such as cyber-attacks, to a smart home system could cause danger by controlling sensors and actuators, opening the doors for a thief. This paper applies an extra layer of security of multi-factor authentication to act as a prevention method for mitigating unauthorized access. One of those factors is face recognition, as it has recently become popular due to its non-invasive biometric techniques, which is easy to use with cameras attached to most trending computers and smartphones. In this paper, the gaps in existing IoT smart home systems have been analyzed, and we have suggested improvements for overcoming them by including necessary system modules and enhancing user registration and log-in authentication. We propose software architecture for implementing such a system. To the best of our knowledge, the existing IoT smart home management research does not support face recognition and liveness detection within the authentication operation of their suggested software architectures.",

    "abstract": "Physical-layer security is regaining traction in the research community, due to the performance boost introduced by deep learning classification algorithms. This is particularly true for sender authentication in wireless communications via radio fingerprinting. However, previous research efforts mainly focused on terrestrial wireless devices while, to the best of our knowledge, none of the previous work took into consideration satellite transmitters. The satellite scenario is generally challenging because, among others, satellite radio transducers feature non-standard electronics (usually aged and specifically designed for harsh conditions). Moreover, the fingerprinting task is specifically difficult for Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites (like the ones we focus in this paper) since they orbit at about 800Km from the Earth, at a speed of around 25,000Km/h, thus making the receiver experiencing a down-link with unique attenuation and fading characteristics. In this paper, we propose PAST-AI, a methodology tailored to authenticate LEO satellites through fingerprinting of their IQ samples, using advanced AI solutions. Our methodology is tested on real data -- more than 100M I/Q samples -- collected from an extensive measurements campaign on the IRIDIUM LEO satellites constellation, lasting 589 hours. Results are striking: we prove that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and autoencoders (if properly calibrated) can be successfully adopted to authenticate the satellite transducers, with an accuracy spanning between 0.8 and 1, depending on prior assumptions. The proposed methodology, the achieved results, and the provided insights, other than being interesting on their own, when associated to the dataset that we made publicly available, will also pave the way for future research in the area.",

    "abstract": "5G communications proposed significant improvements over 4G in terms of efficiency and security. Among these novelties, the 5G Network Slicing seems to have a prominent role: deploy multiple virtual network slices, each providing a different service with different needs and features. Like this, a Slice Operator (SO) ruling a specific slice may want to offer a service for users meeting some requirements. It is of paramount importance to provide a robust authentication protocol, able to ensure that users meet the requirements, but providing at the same time a privacy-by-design architecture. This makes even more sense having a growing density of Internet of Things (IoT) devices exchanging private information over the network. In this paper, we improve the 5G network slicing authentication using a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) scheme: granting users full control over their data. We introduce an approach to allow a user to prove his right to access a specific service without leaking any information about him. Such an approach is SANS, a protocol that provides non-linkable protection for any issued information, preventing an SO or an eavesdropper from tracking users' activity and relating it with their real identities. Furthermore, our protocol is scalable and can be taken as a framework for improving related technologies in similar scenarios, like authentication in the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) or other wireless networks and services. Such features can be achieved using cryptographic primitives called Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). Upon implementing our solution using a state-of-the-art ZKP library and performing several experiments, we provide benchmarks demonstrating that our approach is affordable in speed and memory consumption.",

    "abstract": "The widespread use of new technologies such as the Internet of things (IoT) and machine type communication (MTC) forces an increase on the number of user equipments (UE) and MTC devices that are connecting to mobile networks. Inherently, as the number of UEs inside a base station's (BS) coverage area surges, the quality of service (QoS) tends to decline. The use of drone-mounted BS (UxNB) is a solution in places where UEs are densely populated, such as stadiums. UxNB emerges as a promising technology that can be used for capacity injection purposes in the future due to its fast deployment. However, this emerging technology introduces a new security issue. Mutual authentication, creating a secure communication channel between terrestrial BS and UxNB, and fast handover operations may cause security issues in the use of UxNB for capacity injection. This study proposes a scheme for authenticating UxNBs by the terrestrial BSs. The new protocol suggests performing UE handover from terrestrial to UxNB as a group. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no authentication solution between BSs according to LTE and 5G standards. The proposed method provides a solution for the authentication of UxNB by the terrestrial BS. Additionally, a credential sharing phase for each UE in handover is not required in the proposed method. The absence of a credential sharing step saves resources by reducing the number of communications between BSs. Moreover, many UE handover operations are completed in concise time within the proposed group handover method.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) deployed in real-life applications such as autonomous vehicles have shown to be vulnerable to manipulation attacks, such as poisoning attacks and fine-tuning. Hence, it is essential to ensure the integrity and authenticity of CNNs because compromised models can produce incorrect outputs and behave maliciously. In this paper, we propose a self-contained tamper-proofing method, called DeepiSign, to ensure the integrity and authenticity of CNN models against such manipulation attacks. DeepiSign applies the idea of fragile invisible watermarking to securely embed a secret and its hash value into a CNN model. To verify the integrity and authenticity of the model, we retrieve the secret from the model, compute the hash value of the secret, and compare it with the embedded hash value. To minimize the effects of the embedded secret on the CNN model, we use a wavelet-based technique to transform weights into the frequency domain and embed the secret into less significant coefficients. Our theoretical analysis shows that DeepiSign can hide up to 1KB secret in each layer with minimal loss of the model's accuracy. To evaluate the security and performance of DeepiSign, we performed experiments on four pre-trained models (ResNet18, VGG16, AlexNet, and MobileNet) using three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenet) against three types of manipulation attacks (targeted input poisoning, output poisoning, and fine-tuning). The results demonstrate that DeepiSign is verifiable without degrading the classification accuracy, and robust against representative CNN manipulation attacks.",

In this way, legitimate users can be reliably authenticated and false users can be reliably detected. We analyze the ability of a receiver to discriminate between transmitters (users) according to their channel frequency responses. This work is based on a generalized channel response with both spatial and temporal variability, and considers correlations among the time, frequency and spatial domains. Simulation results, using the ray-tracing tool WiSE to generate the time-averaged response, verify the efficacy of the approach under realistic channel conditions, as well as its capability to work under unknown channel variations.",

To obtain some service, we provide enough information about our identity for an unscrupulous person to steal it (for example, we give our credit card number to Amazon.com). One of the consequences is that many people avoid e-commerce entirely due to privacy and security concerns. The solution is to perform authentication without identification. In fact, all on-line actions should be as anonymous as possible, for this is the only way to guarantee security for the overall system. A credential system is a system in which users can obtain credentials from organizations and demonstrate possession of these credentials. Such a system is anonymous when transactions carried out by the same user cannot be linked. An anonymous credential system is of significant practical relevance because it is the best means of providing privacy for users.",

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Design of an efficient and reliable node authentication protocol for such networks is a particularly challenging task since the nodes are battery-driven and resource constrained. This paper presents a robust and efficient key exchange protocol for nodes authentication in a MANET based on multi-path communication. Simulation results demonstrate that the protocol is effective even in presence of large fraction of malicious nodes in the network. Moreover, it has a minimal computation and communication overhead that makes it ideally suitable for MANETs.",

    "abstract": "Activation Codes are used in many different digital services and known by many different names including voucher, e-coupon and discount code. In this paper we focus on a specific class of ACs that are short, human-readable, fixed-length and represent value. Even though this class of codes is extensively used there are no general guidelines for the design of Activation Code schemes. We discuss different methods that are used in practice and propose BEPAC, a new Activation Code scheme that provides both authenticity and confidentiality. The small message space of activation codes introduces some problems that are illustrated by an adaptive chosen-plaintext attack (CPA-2) on a general 3-round Feis- tel network of size 2^(2n) . This attack recovers the complete permutation from at most 2^(n+2) plaintext-ciphertext pairs. For this reason, BEPAC is designed in such a way that authenticity and confidentiality are in- dependent properties, i.e. loss of confidentiality does not imply loss of authenticity.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a strict authentication watermarking for medical images. In this scheme, we define region of interest (ROI) by taking the smallest rectangle around an image. The watermark is generated from hashing the area of interest. The embedding region is considered to be outside the region of interest as to preserve the area from distortion as a result from watermarking. The strict authentication watermarking is robust to some degree of JPEG compression (SAW-JPEG). JPEG compression will be reviewed. To embed a watermark in the spatial domain, we have to make sure that the embedded watermark will survive JPEG quantization process. The watermarking scheme, including data embedding, extracting and verifying procedure were presented. Experimental results showed that such a scheme could embed and extract the watermark at a high compression rate. The watermark is robust to a high compression rate up to 90.6%. The JPEG image quality threshold is 60 for the least significant bit embedding. The image quality threshold is increased to 61 for 2nd and 3rd LSB manipulations.",

    "abstract": "Next generation Internet is highly concerned about the issue of reliability. Principally, the foundation of reliability is authentication of the source IP address. With the signature-and-verification based defense mechanisms available today, unfortunately, there is a lack of hierarchical architecture, which makes the structure of the trust alliance excessively flat and single. Moreover, with the increasing scale of the trust alliance, costs of validation grow so quickly that they do not adapt to incremental deployment. Via comparison with traditional solutions, this article proposes a hierarchical, inter-domain authenticated source address validation solution named SafeZone. SafeZone employs two intelligent designs, lightweight tag replacement and a hierarchical partitioning scheme, each of which helps to ensure that SafeZone can construct trustworthy and hierarchical trust alliances without the negative influences and complex operations on de facto networks. Extensive experiments also indicate that SafeZone can effectively obtain the design goals of a hierarchical architecture, along with lightweight, loose coupling and \"multi-fence support\" and as well as an incremental deployment scheme.",

The most important purpose of off-line handwriting recognition is in protection systems and authentication. Arabic Handwriting scripts are much more complicated in comparison to Latin scripts. This paper introduces a simple and novel methodology to authenticate Arabic handwriting characters. Reaching our aim, we built our own character database. The research methodology depends on two stages: The first is character extraction where preprocessing the word and then apply segmentation process to obtain the character. The second is the character recognition by matching the characters comprising the word with the letters in the database. Our results ensure character recognition with 81%.

    "abstract": "In recent years, radio frequency identification technology has moved into the mainstream applications that help to speed up handling of manufactured goods and materials. RFID tags are divided into two classes: active and passive. Active tag requires a power source that's why its cost is more than passive tags. However, the low-cost RFID tags are facing new challenges to security and privacy. Some solutions utilize expensive cryptographic primitives such as hash or encryption functions, and some lightweight approaches have been reported to be not secure. This paper describes a lightweight Mutual authentication and ownership transfer protocol utilizing minimalistic cryptography using Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) and Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR). PUFs and LFSRs are very efficient in hardware and particularly suitable for the low-cost RFID tags. To functioning security in low cost RFID tag minimum gate requirement is 2000 gates. To implement security protocols using PUF and LFSR functions need only approx 800 gates. In this paper it is explained how we can authenticate and transfer ownership of low cost RFID tag securely using LFSR and PUF as compared to existing solutions based on hash functions.",

The scheme is designed from the analytical study of state transition behaviour of non-group CA and the basic cryptography/encryption scheme is significantly different from the conventional SS data hiding approaches. Experimental studies confirm that the scheme is robust in terms of confidentiality, authentication, non-repudiation and integrity. The transform domain blind watermarking technique offers better visual & statistical imperceptibility and resiliency against different types of intentional & unintentional image degradations.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of reliably broadcasting information in a multihop asynchronous network that is subject to Byzantine failures. Most existing approaches give conditions for perfect reliable broadcast (all correct nodes deliver the authentic message and nothing else), but they require a highly connected network. An approach giving only probabilistic guarantees (correct nodes deliver the authentic message with high probability) was recently proposed for loosely connected networks, such as grids and tori. Yet, the proposed solution requires a specific initialization (that includes global knowledge) of each node, which may be difficult or impossible to guarantee in self-organizing networks - for instance, a wireless sensor network, especially if they are prone to Byzantine failures. In this paper, we propose a new protocol offering guarantees for loosely connected networks that does not require such global knowledge dependent initialization. In more details, we give a methodology to determine whether a set of nodes will always deliver the authentic message, in any execution. Then, we give conditions for perfect reliable broadcast in a torus network. Finally, we provide experimental evaluation for our solution, and determine the number of randomly distributed Byzantine failures than can be tolerated, for a given correct broadcast probability.",

Unfortunately, they also exacerbate many privacy and tracking risks. We propose Crypto-Book, an anonymizing layer enabling cross-site authentication while reducing these risks. Crypto-Book relies on a set of independently managed servers that collectively assign each social network identity a public/private keypair. Only an identity's owner learns all the private key shares, and can therefore construct the private key, while all participants can obtain any user's public key, even if the corresponding private key has yet to be retrieved. Having obtained an appropriate key set, a user can then leverage anonymous authentication techniques such as linkable ring signatures to log into third-party web sites while preserving privacy. We have implemented a prototype of Crypto-Book and demonstrate its use with three applications: a Wiki system, an anonymous group communication system, and a whistleblower submission system. Our results show that for anonymity sets of size 100, Crypto-Book login takes 0.56s for signature generation by the client, 0.38s for signature verification on the server, and requires 5.6KB of communication bandwidth.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a formal model for order queries on lists in zero knowledge in the traditional authenticated data structure model. We call this model Privacy-Preserving Authenticated List (PPAL). In this model, the queries are performed on the list stored in the (untrusted) cloud where data integrity and privacy have to be maintained. To realize an efficient authenticated data structure, we first adapt consistent data query model. To this end we introduce a formal model called Zero-Knowledge List (ZKL) scheme which generalizes consistent membership queries in zero-knowledge to consistent membership and order queries on a totally ordered set in zero knowledge. We present a construction of ZKL based on zero-knowledge set and homomorphic integer commitment scheme. Then we discuss why this construction is not as efficient as desired in cloud applications and present an efficient construction of PPAL based on bilinear accumulators and bilinear maps which is provably secure and zero-knowledge.",

    "abstract": "We further study the keyless authentication problem in a noisy model in our previous work, where no secret setup is available for sender Alice and receiver Bob while there is DMC $W_1$ from Alice to Bob and a two-way noiseless but insecure channel between them. We propose a construction such that the message length over DMC $W_1$ does not depend on the size of the source space. If the source space is ${\\cal S}$ and the number of channel $W_1$ uses is $n$, then our protocol only has a round complexity of $\\log^*|{\\cal S}|-\\log^*n+4.$ In addition, we show that the round complexity of any secure protocol in our model is lower bounded by $\\log^*|{\\cal S}|-\\log^* n-5$. We also obtain a lower bound on the success probability when the message size on DMC $W_1$ is given. Finally, we derive the capacity for a non-interactive authentication protocol under general DMCs, which extends the result under BSCs in our previous work.",

    "abstract": "In an open network environment, privacy of group communication and integrity of the communication data are the two major issues related to secured information exchange. The required level of security may be achieved by authenticating a group key in the communication channel, where contribution from each group member becomes a part of the overall group key. In the current work, we have developed an authentication system through Central Administrative Server (CAS) for automatic integration and validation of the group key. For secured group communication, the CAS generates a secret alphanumeric group key image. Using secret image sharing scheme, this group key image shares are distributed among all the participating group members in the open network. Some or all the secret shares may be merged to reconstruct the group key image at CAS. A k-nearest neighbor classifier with 48 features to represent the images, is used to validate the reconstructed image with the one stored in the CAS. 48 topological features are used to represent the reconstructed group key image. We have achieved 99.1% classification accuracy for 26 printed English uppercase characters and 10 numeric digits.",

    "abstract": "To circumvent the FLP impossibility result in a deterministic way several protocols have been proposed on top of an asynchronous distributed system enriched with additional assumptions. In the context of Byzantine failures for systems where at most t processes may exhibit a Byzantine behavior, two approaches have been investigated to solve the consensus problem.The first, relies on the addition of synchrony, called Timer-Based, but the second is based on the pattern of the messages that are exchanged, called Time-Free. This paper shows that both types of assumptions are not antagonist and can be combined to solve authenticated Byzantine consensus. This combined assumption considers a correct process pi, called 2t-BW, and a set X of 2t processes such that, eventually, for each query broadcasted by a correct process pj of X, pj receives a response from pi 2 X among the (n- t) first responses to that query or both links connecting pi and pj are timely. Based on this combination, a simple hybrid authenticated Byzantine consensus protocol,benefiting from the best of both worlds, is proposed. Whereas many hybrid protocols have been designed for the consensus problem in the crash model, this is, to our knowledge, the first hybrid deterministic solution to the Byzantine consensus problem.",

Additionally, the considered finite field transforms are adjusted to be number theoretic transforms, appropriate for error-free calculation. The employed technique can provide invisible fragile watermarking for authentication systems with tamper location capability. It is shown that the choice of the finite field characteristic is pivotal to obtain perceptually invisible watermarked images.

All stages of the framework's pipeline are designed to be used in an automatic fashion. First, the optimal focus is selected using the absolute gradient method. Then, pollen grains are extracted using a coarse-to-fine approach involving both clustering and morphological techniques (coarse stage), and a snake-based segmentation (fine stage). Finally, features are extracted and selected using a generalized approach, and their classification is tested with four classifiers: Weighted Neighbor Distance, Neural Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest. The latter method, which has shown the best and more robust classification accuracy results (above 97\\% for any number of pollen types), is finally used for the authentication stage.",

Conventionally, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is utilized for a secure communication with the pre-certified public key. However, a secure vehicle-to-vehicle communication requires additional means of verification in order to avoid impersonation attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes to certify both the public key and out-of-band sense-able static attributes to enable mutual authentication of the communicating vehicles. Vehicle owners are bound to preprocess (periodically) a certificate for both a public key and a list of fixed unchangeable attributes of the vehicle. Furthermore, the proposed approach is shown to be adaptable with regards to the existing authentication protocols.

In this paper, we present a solution called Trust-in-the-Middle, a TPM based proxy system which ensures that user credentials are securely stored and submitted without disclosing them even if the proxy is compromised. We build our architecture on a trust chain bootstrapped by TPM DRTM and prevent access to credentials if any entity in the chain is maliciously modified. We use remote attestation to guarantee that all critical operations on the proxy are performed securely and credentials are cryptographically protected when they are not in DRTM-supported isolation.",

However, the existing approaches are obtrusive since the user is required to perform explicit gestures in order to be authenticated. While the gait signal captured by inertial sensors is understood to be a reliable profile for effective implicit authentication, recent studies have been conducted in ideal conditions and might therefore be inapplicable in the real mobile context. Particularly, the acquiring sensor is always fixed to a specific position and orientation. This paper mainly focuses on addressing the instability of sensor's orientation which mostly happens in the reality. A flexible solution taking advantages of available sensors on mobile devices which can help to handle this problem is presented. Moreover, a novel gait recognition method utilizes statistical analysis and supervised learning to adapt itself to the instability of the biometric gait under various circumstances is also proposed.

A survey was used to collect quantitative data from the ATM users which was then analysed using factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. The study established that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and user privacy were key determinants for biometric ATMs acceptance, adoption and usage. The study further demonstrated that age, gender and experience were moderating factors on effort expectancy with experience further moderating performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and user privacy.

We propose the design and implementation of Secure Mobile Identities (SMI), a repetitive key-exchange protocol that uses this weak SIM authentication as a foundation to enable mobile users to establish stronger identity authenticity. The security guarantees of SMI are directly reliant on the mobility of users and are further enhanced by external trusted entities providing trusted location signatures (e.g. trusted GPS, NFC synchronization points).

IDNet is the first system that exploits a deep learning approach as universal feature extractors for gait recognition, and that combines classification results from subsequent walking cycles into a multi-stage decision making framework. Experimental results show the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art techniques, leading to misclassification rates (either false negatives or positives) smaller than 0.15% with fewer than five walking cycles.

On the one hand, federated identity ensures usability and provides economic benefits to service providers. On the other hand, it poses serious privacy threats to users as well as service providers. The current technology, which is prevalently deployed on the Internet, allows identity providers to track the user's behavior across a broad range of services. In this work, we propose PRIMA, a universal credential-based authentication system for supporting federated identity management in a privacy-preserving manner. Basically, PRIMA does not require any interaction between service providers and identity providers during the authentication process, thus preventing identity providers to profile users' behavior. Moreover, throughout the authentication process, PRIMA provides a mechanism for controlled disclosure of the users' private information. We have conducted comprehensive evaluations of the system to show the feasibility of our approach. Our performance analysis shows that an identity provider can process 1,426 to 3,332 requests per second when the key size is varied from 1024 to 2048-bit, respectively.",

We evaluate the performance of RNN models on three types of devices; smartphone, smartwatch, and Raspberry Pi and show that unlike CNN models, RNN models can be easily ported onto resource-constrained devices without a significant loss in accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Fallback authentication is used to retrieve forgotten passwords. Security questions are one of the main techniques used to conduct fallback authentication. In this paper, we propose a serious game design that uses system-generated security questions with the aim of improving the usability of fallback authentication. For this purpose, we adopted the popular picture-based \"4 Pics 1 word\" mobile game. This game was selected because of its use of pictures and cues, which previous psychology research found to be crucial to aid memorability. This game asks users to pick the word that relates to the given pictures. We then customized this game by adding features which help maximize the following memory retrieval skills: (a) verbal cues - by providing hints with verbal descriptions, (b) spatial cues - by maintaining the same order of pictures, (c) graphical cues - by showing 4 images for each challenge, (d) interactivity/engaging nature of the game.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing is an upcoming technology that has been designed for commercial needs. One of the major issues in cloud computing is the difficulty to manage federated identities and the trust between the user and the service providers. This paper focuses on how security can be provided between the user and the service provider and how the user information can be authenticated. For the purpose of providing privacy and authentication, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) based Single Sign-On is used. Security is provided by using Hash based Encryption algorithm (HBE). HBE algorithm works with the help of Key Exchange Protocol which contains poly hash function. In the algorithm, Identity providers maintain user directory and authenticates user information; service provider provides the service to users. The user has to register their details with the identity provider prior to this. During this stage, Hash based Encryption algorithm is used to provide secure communication between the identity provider and the user. In this paper we suggest that higher security can be given to user login by using an additional cryptographic technique, i.e. Hash based Encryption algorithm with the help of the Key Exchange Protocol.",

A widely investigated solution to such threats consists in processing the biometric signals under encryption, to avoid any leakage of information towards non-authorised parties. In this paper, we propose to leverage on the superior performance of multimodal biometric recognition to improve the efficiency of a biometric-based authentication protocol operating on encrypted data under the malicious security model. In the proposed protocol, authentication relies on both facial and iris biometrics, whose representation accuracy is specifically tailored to trade-off between recognition accuracy and efficiency. From a cryptographic point of view, the protocol relies on SPDZ a new multy-party computation tool designed by Damgaard et al. Experimental results show that the multimodal protocol is faster than corresponding unimodal protocols achieving the same accuracy.",

A typical counter-measure to avoid this risk is to set up a secret code that has to be entered to unlock the device after a period of inactivity. However, for blind users, PINs and passwords are inadequate, since entry 1) consumes a non-trivial amount of time, e.g. using screen readers, 2) is susceptible to observation, where nearby people can see or hear the secret code, and 3) might collide with social norms, e.g. disrupting personal interactions. Tap-based authentication methods have been presented and allow unlocking to be performed in a short time and support naturally occurring inconspicuous behavior (e.g. concealing the device inside a jacket) by being usable with a single hand. This paper presents a study with blind users (N = 16) where an authentication method based on tap phrases is evaluated. Results showed the method to be usable and to support the desired inconspicuity.",

The proposed method, namely the Marginally Smoothed HMM (MSHMM), utilizes the marginal probabilities of location and timing information of the observations to smooth-out the emission probabilities while training. Hence, it can efficiently handle unforeseen observations during the test phase. The verification performance of this method is compared to a sequence matching (SM) method , a Markov Chain-based method (MC) and an HMM with basic Laplace Smoothing (HMM-lap). Experimental results using the location information of the UMD Active Authentication Dataset-02 (UMDAA02) and the GeoLife dataset are presented. The proposed MSHMM method outperforms the compared methods in terms of equal error rate (EER). Additionally, the effects of different parameters on the proposed method are discussed.",

The authors also introduced a new security notion for IBAKE protocols called resiliency, that is, if a shared secret between a group of parties is compromised or leaked, they can generate another completely new shared secret without the need to set up a new key exchange session. They then proved that their IBAKE protocol satisfies this security notion. We analyze the security of their protocol and prove that it has a major security flaw which renders it insecure against an impersonation attack.

In this paper, we introduce a new protocol called a Meta Key Agreement and Authentication Protocol (MKAAP) that has some characteristics of a public-key solution and some of a shared-key solution. Specifically it has the deployment benefits of a public-key system, allowing two entities that have never met before to authenticate without requiring real-time access to a third-party, but does require secure provisioning of key material from a trusted key distribution system (similar to a symmetric system) prior to deployment. We then describe a specific MKAAP instance, the Ironwood MKAAP, discuss its security, and show how it resists certain quantum attacks such as Shor's algorithm or Grover's quantum search algorithm. We also show Ironwood implemented on several ``internet of things'' (IoT devices), measure its performance, and show how it performs significantly better than ECC using fewer device resources.",

Specifically, we assume that a user carries a personal voice-powered device (e.g., smartphone, smartwatch, or smartglass), which serves as the user's identity. When another voice-powered IoT device of the user requires authentication, PIANO estimates the distance between the two devices by playing and detecting certain acoustic signals; PIANO grants access if the estimated distance is no larger than a user-selected threshold. We implemented a proof-of-concept prototype of PIANO. Through theoretical and empirical evaluations, we find that PIANO is secure, reliable, personalizable, and efficient.",

The Diffie-Hellman protocol is used with a short authentication string (SAS)-based key agreement over Wi-Fi Direct out-of-band communication channels. It protects the communication from any man-in-the-middle security threats. In particular, the security process is integrated into two LAR routing schemes, i.e., the request-zone LAR scheme and the distance-based LAR scheme. We conduct extensive simulations with different network parameters such as the vehicular node density, the number of the malicious nodes, and the speed of the nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed routing protocols provide superior performance in secure data delivery and average total packet delay.

Nowadays, due to the widespread use of smartphones, mobile user authentication is often favoured. This naturally supports two-factor authentication schemes (2FA). We use the term mobile derived identity to stress two aspects: a) the identity is enabled for mobile usage and b) the identity is somehow derived from a physical or digital proof of identity. This work reviews 21 systems that support mobile derived identities. One subset of the considered systems is already in place (public or private sector in Europe), another subset is subject to research. Our goal is to identify prevalent design and implementation aspects for these systems in order to gain a better understanding on best practises and common views on mobile derived identities. We found, that research prefers storing identity data on the mobile device itself whereas real world systems usually rely on cloud storage. 2FA is common in both worlds, however biometrics as second factor is the exception.",

Every time a particular algorithm is selected, the corresponding developer is rendered a micropayment.

It is based on the segmentation of the signature skeleton (through standard image skeletonization) into unambiguous sequences of points, or unambiguously connected skeleton segments corresponding to vectorial representations of signature portions. These segments are assumed to be the fundamental carriers of useful information for authenticity verification, and are compactly encoded as sets of 9 scalars (4 sampled coordinates and 1 length measure). Thus signature authenticity is inferred through Euclidean distance based comparisons between pairs of such compact representations. The average performance of this method is evaluated through experiments with offline versions of signatures from the MCYT-100 database. For comparison purposes, three other approaches are applied to the same set of signatures, namely: (1) a straightforward approach based on Dynamic Time Warping distances between segments, (2) a published method by [shanker2007], also based on DTW, and (3) the average human performance under equivalent experimental protocol. Results suggest that if human performance is taken as a goal for automatic verification, then we should discard signature shape details to approach this goal. Moreover, our best result -- close to human performance -- was obtained by the simplest strategy, where equal weights were given to segment shape and length.",

Beside unfulfilled reliability requirements, the availability of a system can further be reduced, if it is under attack in the sense of violation of information security goals such as data authenticity or integrity. In order to guarantee the safe operation of an application, a system has at least to be able to detect these attacks. Though there are numerous techniques in the sense of conventional cryptography in order to achieve that goal, these are not always suited for the requirements of the applications mentioned due to resource inefficiency. In the present work, we show how the goal of message authenticity based on physical layer security (PHYSEC) can be achieved.

The gesture patterns of the user are modeled from multiple sensors - touch, accelerometer and gyroscope data using a continuous left-right HMM. The approach models the tap and stroke patterns of a user since these are the basic and most frequently used interactions on a mobile device. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method a new data set has been created from 42 users who interacted with off-the-shelf applications on their smart phones.

    "abstract": "Many of the benefits we derive from the Internet require trust in the authenticity of HTTPS connections. Unfortunately, the public key certification ecosystem that underwrites this trust has failed us on numerous occasions. Towards an exploration of the root causes we present an update to the common knowledge about the Certificate Authority (CA) ecosystem. Based on our findings the certificate ecosystem currently undergoes a drastic transformation. Big steps towards ubiquitous encryption were made, however, on the expense of trust for authentication of communication partners. Furthermore we describe systemic problems rooted in misaligned incentives between players in the ecosystem. We depict that proposed security extensions do not correctly realign these incentives. As such we argue that it is worth considering alternative methods of authentication. As a first step in this direction we propose an insurance-based mechanism and we demonstrate that it is technically feasible.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor networks (WSN) today suffer from a lack of security adapted to their multiple constraints, to which authentication and trust management solutions such as PGP only partially responds. On the one hand, the constraints of autonomy and co-operation of the nodes necessary to guarantee the coherence of the network do not require a distributed solution. On the other hand, the constraints of energy consumption and the low computing power of the nodes require the use of algorithms of low complexity (Zhang2014) . To our knowledge, no solution can answer both these problems at the same time. We are proposing a new solution for securing WSNs named BATMAN (Blockchain Authentication and Trust Module in Ad-hoc Networks) to reply to these challenges. We present a model of centralized management for authentication and trust, implementable on the Tezos blockchain, and evaluate through simulation the confidence estimators proposed here.",

    "abstract": "Arithmetic Coding is an efficient lossless compression scheme applied for many multimedia standards such as JPEG, JPEG2000, H.263, H.264 and H.265. Due to nonlinearity, high error propagation and high error sensitivity of arithmetic coders, many techniques have been developed for extending the usage of arithmetic coders for security as a lightweight joint compression and encryption solution for systems with limited resources. Through this paper, we will describe how to upgrade these techniques to achieve an additional low cost authentication and integrity capabilities with arithmetic coders. Consequently, the new proposed technique can produce a secure and lightweight framework of compression, encryption, authentication and integrity for limited resources environments such as Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded systems. Although the proposed technique can be used alongside with any arithmetic coder based system, we will focus on the implementations for JPEG and JPEG2000 standards.",

    "abstract": "The secure distribution of protected content requires consumer authentication and involves the conventional method of end-to-end encryption. However, in information-centric networking (ICN) the end-to-end encryption makes the content caching ineffective since encrypted content stored in a cache is useless for any consumer except those who know the encryption key. For effective caching of encrypted content in ICN, we propose a novel scheme, called the Secure Distribution of Protected Content (SDPC). SDPC ensures that only authenticated consumers can access the content. The SDPC is a lightweight authentication and key distribution protocol; it allows consumer nodes to verify the originality of the published article by using a symmetric key encryption. The security of the SDPC was proved with BAN logic and Scyther tool verification.",

Next, we modify the 5G-AKA protocol to prevent these attacks, while satisfying the cost and efficiency constraints of the 5G-AKA protocol. We then formally prove that our protocol is sigma-unlinkable. This is a new security notion, which allows for a fine-grained quantification of a protocol privacy. Our security proof is carried out in the Bana-Comon indistinguishability logic. We also prove mutual authentication as a secondary result.",

We have learned that users' choice of patterns mimics the poor password choices in other systems, such as PIN or text-based passwords. A wide variety of analysis and data collections methods was used to reach these conclusions, but what is missing from the literature is a systemized comparison of the related work in this space that compares both the methodology and the results. In this paper, we take a detailed accounting of the different methods applied to data collection and analysis for Android unlock patterns. We do so in two dimensions. First we systemize prior work into a detailed taxonomy of collection methods, and in the second dimension, we perform a detailed analysis of 9 different data sets collected using different methods. While this study focuses singularly on the collection methods and comparisons of the Android pattern unlock scheme, we believe that many of the findings generalize to other graphical password schemes, unlock authentication technology, and other knowledge-based authentication schemes.",

    "abstract": "An approach is developed for analyzing computer networks to identify systems and accounts that are at particular risk of compromise by an adversary seeking to move laterally through the network via authentication. The dynamics of the adversary are modeled as a contagion spreading across systems linked via authentication relationships derived from Administrator account access and active session data. The adversary is assumed to traverse the network via credential chaining, where the adversary steals credentials from one system, uses them to authenticate to another, and repeats the process. Graph topology measures are used to analyze different contagion models applied to a real Windows network for three primary exposures by identifying: accounts which, either individually or collectively, provide wide and far-reaching access to many systems across the network; accounts with notable privilege escalation liability; and \"gatekeeper\" systems through which the adversary must pass in order to reach critical assets. The approach can be used to test how different mitigations and countermeasures affect these exposures; for example, we find that disabling remote logins by local accounts and implementing protections that prevent the caching of credentials on remote hosts can substantially curtail lateral movement and privilege escalation.",

The scheme is a multiparty interactive solution that combines RSA distributed key generation and attribute-based encryption. We believe that it will be a robust IDM privacy-preserving solution in cloud computing, because it has the following features: (i) protects sensitive data on untrusted hosts using active bundle; (ii) supports the minimum disclosure property; (iii) minimizes authentication overhead by providing single sign-on; (iv) supports authentication with encrypted credentials; (v) avoids using trusted third parties (TTPs_, incl. using TTPs for key management; (vi) supports revocation and delegation of access right; and (vii) supports revocation of user credentials.

We first show a series of impossibility results forbidding the achievement of very strong security, leaving open the feasibility of achieving a weaker security notion. We then answer this open question positively by presenting a construction for quantum PAKE that provably achieves everlasting security in the simulation-based model. Everlasting security is a security notion introduced by M\\\"uller-Quade and Unruh in 2007, which implies unconditional security after the execution of the protocol and only reduces the power of the adversary to be computational during the execution of the protocol, which seems quite a reasonable assumption for nowadays practical use-cases.",

Traditional efforts to secure these devices against impersonation attacks mainly rely on either dedicated sensors or specified user motions, impeding their wide-scale adoption. This paper transcends these limitations with a general security solution by leveraging ubiquitous wireless chips available in IoT devices. Particularly, representative time and frequency features are first extracted from received signal strengths (RSSs) to characterize radio propagation profiles. Then, an adversarial multi-player network is developed to recognize underlying radio propagation patterns and facilitate on-body device authentication. We prove that at equilibrium, our adversarial model can extract all information about propagation patterns and eliminate any irrelevant information caused by motion variances. We build a prototype of our system using universal software radio peripheral (USRP) devices and conduct extensive experiments with both static and dynamic body motions in typical indoor and outdoor environments. The experimental results show that our system achieves an average authentication accuracy of 90.4%, with a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.958 and better generalization performance in comparison with the conventional non-adversarial-based approach.",

Using document boundaries present in the authentic and synthetic parallel data, we create sequences of up to 1000 subword segments and train transformer translation models.

We further explore multi-task training for the incorporation of document-level source language monolingual data via the BERT-objective on the encoder and two-pass decoding for combinations of sentence-level and document-level systems. Based on preliminary human evaluation results, evaluators strongly prefer the document-level systems over our comparable sentence-level system.

To mitigate single point failures, new and technologically advanced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) tools have been developed as security solutions. However, the usability and adoption of such tools have raised concerns. An obvious solution can be viewed as conducting user studies to create more user-friendly MFA tools. To learn more, we performed a systematic literature review of recently published academic papers (N = 623) that primarily focused on MFA technologies. While majority of these papers (m = 300) proposed new MFA tools, only 9.1% of papers performed any user evaluation research. Our meta-analysis of user focused studies (n = 57) showed that researchers found lower adoption rate to be inevitable for MFAs, while avoidance was pervasive among mandatory use. Furthermore, we noted several reporting and methodological discrepancies in the user focused studies. We identified trends in participant recruitment that is indicative of demographic biases.",

    "abstract": "We live in an era of information and it is very important to handle the exchange of information. While sending data to an authorized source, we need to protect it from unauthorized sources, changes, and authentication. ZKP technique can be used in designing secure authentication systems that dont involve any direct exchange of information between the claimant and the verifier thus preventing any possible leak of personal information. We propose a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) algorithm based on isomorphic graphs. We suggest most of the computations should be carried out on the users' web browser without revealing the password to the server at any point in time. Instead, it will generate random graphs and their permutations based on the login ID and password.",

    "abstract": "Given a large enterprise network of devices and their authentication history (e.g., device logons), how can we quantify network vulnerability to lateral attack and identify at-risk devices? We systematically address these problems through D2M, the first framework that models lateral attacks on enterprise networks using multiple attack strategies developed with researchers, engineers, and threat hunters in the Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection group. These strategies integrate real-world adversarial actions (e.g., privilege escalation) to generate attack paths: a series of compromised machines. Leveraging these attack paths and a novel Monte-Carlo method, we formulate network vulnerability as a probabilistic function of the network topology, distribution of access credentials and initial penetration point. To identify machines at risk to lateral attack, we propose a suite of five fast graph mining techniques, including a novel technique called AnomalyShield inspired by node immunization research. Using three real-world authentication graphs from Microsoft and Los Alamos National Laboratory (up to 223,399 authentications), we report the first experimental results on network vulnerability to lateral attack, demonstrating D2M's unique potential to empower IT admins to develop robust user access credential policies.",

With 1K users for testing the network, a population size comparable to previous works, TypeNet obtains an equal error rate of 4.8% using only 5 enrollment sequences and 1 test sequence per user with 50 keystrokes per sequence. Using the same amount of data per user, as the number of test users is scaled up to 100K, the performance in comparison to 1K decays relatively by less than 5%, demonstrating the potential of TypeNet to scale well at large scale number of users.

Yet, this requires an additional relatively expensive depth sensor. To mitigate this, we propose a novel authentication system, based on slim grayscale coded light field imaging. We provide a reconstruction free fast anti-spoofing mechanism, working directly on the coded image. It is followed by a multi-view, multi-modal face verification network that given grayscale data together with a low-res depth map achieves competitive results to the RGB case. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on a simulated 3D (RGBD) version of LFW, which will be made public, and a set of real faces acquired by a light field computational camera.",

In this paper, we studied Knock Codes security asking participants to select codes on mobile devices in three settings: a control treatment, a blocklist treatment, and a treatment with a larger, 2x3 grid. We find that Knock Codes are significantly weaker than other deployed authentication, e.g., PINs or Android patterns. In a simulated attacker setting, 2x3 grids offered no additional security, but blocklisting was more beneficial, making Knock Codes' security similar to Android patterns. Participants expressed positive perceptions of Knock Codes, but usability was challenged. SUS values were \"marginal\" or \"ok\" across treatments. Based on these findings, we recommend deploying blacklists for selecting a Knock Code because it improves security but has limited impact on usability perceptions.",

Addressing this gap, we introduce a new method for extracting a hardware fingerprint of an IoT sensor which can be used for secret-free authentication. By comparing the fingerprint against reference measurements recorded prior to deployment, we can tell whether the sensing hardware connected to the IoT device has been changed by environmental effects or with malicious intent. Our approach exploits the characteristic behavior of analog circuits, which is revealed by applying a fixed-frequency alternating current to the sensor, while recording its output voltage. To demonstrate the general feasibility of our method, we apply it to four commercially available temperature sensors using laboratory equipment and evaluate the accuracy. The results indicate that with a sensible configuration of the two hyperparameters we can identify individual sensors with high probability, using only a few recordings from the target device.",

Having the ability to differentiate users, typing behaviors can unobtrusively form a component of a behavioral biometric recognition system to improve existing account security. Keystroke dynamics systems on free-text data have previously required 500 or more characters to achieve reasonable performance. In this paper, we propose a novel instance-based graph comparison algorithm called the instance-based tail area density (ITAD) metric to reduce the number of keystrokes required to authenticate users. Additionally, commonly used features in the keystroke dynamics literature, such as monographs and digraphs, are all found to be useful in informing who is typing. The usefulness of these features for authentication is determined using a random forest classifier and validated across two publicly available datasets. Scores from the individual features are fused to form a single matching score. With the fused matching score and our ITAD metric, we achieve equal error rates (EERs) for 100 and 200 testing digraphs of 9.7% and 7.8% for the Clarkson II dataset, improving upon state-of-the-art of 35.3% and 15.3%.",

UA models are trained to map input data of different users to highly separable embedding vectors, which are then used to accept or reject new inputs at test time. Training UA models requires having direct access to the raw inputs and embedding vectors of users, both of which are privacy-sensitive information. In this paper, we propose Federated User Authentication (FedUA), a framework for privacy-preserving training of UA models. FedUA adopts federated learning framework to enable a group of users to jointly train a model without sharing the raw inputs. It also allows users to generate their embeddings as random binary vectors, so that, unlike the existing approach of constructing the spread out embeddings by the server, the embedding vectors are kept private as well. We show our method is privacy-preserving, scalable with number of users, and allows new users to be added to training without changing the output layer. Our experimental results on the VoxCeleb dataset for speaker verification shows our method reliably rejects data of unseen users at very high true positive rates.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, power systems have experienced drastic transformations in order to address the growth in energy demand, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance power quality and energy efficiency. This shift to the smart grid concept involves, among others, the utilization of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar panels and storage systems, contributing towards grid decentralization while improving control over power generation. In order to seamlessly integrate DERs into power systems, embedded devices are used to support the communication and control functions of DERs. As a result, vulnerabilities of such components can be ported to the industrial environment. Insecure control networks and protocols further exacerbate the problem. Towards reducing the attack surface, we present an authentication scheme for DERs, DERauth, which leverages the inherent entropy of the DER battery energy storage system (BESS) as a root-of-trust. The DER authentication is achieved using a challenge-reply mechanism that relies on the corresponding DER's BESS state-of-charge (SoC) and voltage measurements. A dynamically updating process ensures that the BESS state is up-to-date. We evaluate our proof-of-concept in a prototype development that uses lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries for the BESS. The robustness of our design is assessed against modeling attacks performed by neural networks.",

    "abstract": "On today's Internet, combining the end-to-end security of TLS with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) while ensuring the authenticity of connections results in a challenging delegation problem. When CDN servers provide content, they have to authenticate themselves as the origin server to establish a valid end-to-end TLS connection with the client. In standard TLS, the latter requires access to the secret key of the server. To curb this problem, multiple workarounds exist to realize a delegation of the authentication. In this paper, we present a solution that renders key sharing unnecessary and reduces the need for workarounds. By adapting identity-based signatures to this setting, our solution offers short-lived delegations. Additionally, by enabling forward-security, existing delegations remain valid even if the server's secret key leaks. We provide an implementation of the scheme and discuss integration into a TLS stack. In our evaluation, we show that an efficient implementation incurs less overhead than a typical network round trip. Thereby, we propose an alternative approach to current delegation practices on the web.",

    "abstract": "Rolling out a new security mechanism in an organisation requires planning, good communication, adoption from users, iterations of reflection on the challenges experienced and how they were overcome. Our case study elicited users' perceptions to reflect on the adoption and usage of the two factor authentication (2FA) mechanism being rolled out within our higher education organisation. This was achieved using a mixed method research approach. Our qualitative analysis, using content and thematic coding, revealed that initially SMS was the most popular 'second factor' and the main usability issue with 2FA was the getting the authenticator app to work; this result was unexpected by the IT team and led to a change in how the technology was subsequently rolled out to make the authenticator app the default primary second factor. Several lessons were learnt about the information users needed; this included how to use the technology in different scenarios and also a wider appreciation of why the technology was beneficial to a user and the organisation. The case study also highlighted a positive impact on the security posture of the organisation which was measure using IT service request metrics.",

    "abstract": "The majority of systems rely on user authentication on passwords, but passwords have so many weaknesses and widespread use that easily raise significant security concerns, regardless of their encrypted form. Users hold the same password for different accounts, administrators never check password files for flaws that might lead to a successful cracking, and the lack of a tight security policy regarding regular password replacement are a few problems that need to be addressed. The proposed research work aims at enhancing this security mechanism, prevent penetrations, password theft, and attempted break-ins towards securing computing systems. The selected solution approach is two-folded; it implements a two-factor authentication scheme to prevent unauthorized access, accompanied by Honeyword principles to detect corrupted or stolen tokens. Both can be integrated into any platform or web application with the use of QR codes and a mobile phone.",

    "abstract": "Network coding provides the advantage of maximizing the usage of network resources, and has great application prospects in future network communications. However, the properties of network coding also make the pollution attack more serious. In this paper, we give an unconditional secure authentication scheme for network coding based on a linear code $C$. Safavi-Naini and Wang gave an authentication code for multi-receivers and multiple messages. We notice that the scheme of Safavi-Naini and Wang is essentially constructed with Reed-Solomon codes. And we modify their construction slightly to make it serve for authenticating subspace codes over linear network. Also, we generalize the construction with linear codes. The generalization to linear codes has the similar advantages as generalizing Shamir's secret sharing scheme to linear secret sharing sceme based on linear codes. One advantage of this generalization is that for a fixed message space, our scheme allows arbitrarily many receivers to check the integrity of their own messages, while the scheme with Reed-Solomon codes has a constraint on the number of verifying receivers. Another advantage is that we introduce access structure in the generalized scheme. Massey characterized the access structure of linear secret sharing scheme by minimal codewords in the dual code whose first component is 1. We slightly modify the definition of minimal codewords. Let $C$ be a $[V,k]$ linear code. For any coordinate $i\\in \\{1,2,\\cdots,V\\}$, a codeword $\\vec{c}$ in $C$ is called minimal respect to $i$ if the codeword $\\vec{c}$ has component 1 at the $i$-th coordinate and there is no other codeword whose $i$-th component is 1 with support strictly contained in that of $\\vec{c}$. Then the security of receiver $R_i$ in our authentication scheme is characterized by the minimal codewords respect to $i$ in the dual code $C^\\bot$.",

    "abstract": "Traditional authentication in radio-frequency (RF) systems enable secure data communication within a network through techniques such as digital signatures and hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC), which suffer from key recovery attacks. State-of-the-art IoT networks such as Nest also use Open Authentication (OAuth 2.0) protocols that are vulnerable to cross-site-recovery forgery (CSRF), which shows that these techniques may not prevent an adversary from copying or modeling the secret IDs or encryption keys using invasive, side channel, learning or software attacks. Physical unclonable functions (PUF), on the other hand, can exploit manufacturing process variations to uniquely identify silicon chips which makes a PUF-based system extremely robust and secure at low cost, as it is practically impossible to replicate the same silicon characteristics across dies. Taking inspiration from human communication, which utilizes inherent variations in the voice signatures to identify a certain speaker, we present RF- PUF: a deep neural network-based framework that allows real-time authentication of wireless nodes, using the effects of inherent process variation on RF properties of the wireless transmitters (Tx), detected through in-situ machine learning at the receiver (Rx) end. The proposed method utilizes the already-existing asymmetric RF communication framework and does not require any additional circuitry for PUF generation or feature extraction. Simulation results involving the process variations in a standard 65 nm technology node, and features such as LO offset and I-Q imbalance detected with a neural network having 50 neurons in the hidden layer indicate that the framework can distinguish up to 4800 transmitters with an accuracy of 99.9% (~ 99% for 10,000 transmitters) under varying channel conditions, and without the need for traditional preambles.",

    "abstract": "We present a practical methodology for securing the password-based authentication scheme. We propose a solution based on the well-known (k,n) threshold scheme of Shamir for sharing a secret, where in our case the secret is the password itself and (k,n) threshold scheme means that n password-derived secrets (shares) are created and k less than n shares are necessary and sufficient for reconstructing the password, while k-1 are not sufficient. The scheme is information-theoretic secure. Since each of the n shares is stored on a different host (shareholder), an attacker will need to compromise k different shareholders for obtaining an amount of data sufficient for reconstructing the secret. Furthermore, in order to be resistant to the compromising of the server (dealer) coordinating the shareholders we define a variant of the classic Shamir, where the Shamir's abscissae are unknown to dealer and shareholders, making the reconstruction impossible even in the case of dealer and shareholders compromised. In addition we use the Pedersen technique for allowing the verification of shares. For the described scenario we have designed two protocols: the registration (user's sign-up, to be carried out once), and authentication (user's login). We analyse several scenarios where dealer and/or shareholders are partially/totally compromised and confirm that none of them is enabling the attacker to break the authentication. Furthermore we focus on cases where one or more byzantine servers are presented, analysing the impact on the framework and show the adopted mechanisms to be safe against these kinds of attacks. We have developed a prototype demonstrating that our framework works correctly, effectively and efficiently. It provides a first feasibility study that will provide a base for structured and engineered cloud-based implementations aiming at providing an authentication-as-a-service.",

    "abstract": "The exponentially increasing number of ubiquitous wireless devices connected to the Internet in Internet of Things (IoT) networks highlights the need for a new paradigm of data flow management in such large-scale networks under software defined wireless networking (SDWN). The limited power and computation capability available at IoT devices as well as the centralized management and decision-making approach in SDWN introduce a whole new set of security threats to the networks. In particular, the authentication mechanism between the controllers and the forwarding devices in SDWNs is a key challenge from both secrecy and integrity aspects. Conventional authentication protocols based on public key infrastructure (PKI) are no longer sufficient for these networks considering the large-scale and heterogeneity nature of the networks as well as their deployment cost, and security vulnerabilities due to key distribution and storage. We propose a novel security protocol based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) known as hardware security primitives to enhance the authentication security in SDWNs. In this approach, digital PUFs are developed using the inherent randomness of the nanomaterials of Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) that are embedded in most IoT devices to enable a secure authentication and access control in these networks. These PUFs are developed based on a novel approach of multi-states, in which the natural drifts due to the physical variations in the environment are predicted to reduce the potential errors in challenge-response pairs of PUFs being tested in different situations. We also proposed a PUF-based PKI protocol to secure the controller in SDWNs. The performance of the developed ReRAM-based PUFs are evaluated in the experimental results.",

We aim to quantify the impact of factors used by 3DS 2.0 in its fraud-detection decision making process. Method. We ran credit card transactions with two Web sites systematically manipulating the nominal IVs \\textsf{machine\\_data}, \\textsf{value}, \\textsf{region}, and \\textsf{website}. We measured whether the user was \\textsf{challenged} with an authentication, whether the transaction was \\textsf{declined}, and whether the card was \\textsf{blocked} as nominal DVs. Results. While \\textsf{website} and \\textsf{card} largely did not show a significant impact on any outcome, \\textsf{machine\\_data}, \\textsf{value} and \\textsf{region} did. A change in \\textsf{machine\\_data}, \\textsf{region} or \\textsf{value} made it 5-7 times as likely to be challenged with password authentication. However, even in a foreign region with another factor being changed, the overall likelihood of being challenged only reached $60\\%$. When in the card's home region, a transaction will be rarely declined ($< 5\\%$ in control, $40\\%$ with one factor changed). However, in a region foreign to the card the system will more likely decline transactions anyway (about $60\\%$) and any change in \\textsf{machine\\_data} or \\textsf{value} will lead to a near-certain declined transaction. The \\textsf{region} was the only significant predictor for a card being blocked ($\\mathsf{OR}=3$). Conclusions. We found that the decisions to challenge the user with a password authentication, to decline a transaction and to block a card are governed by different weightings. 3DS 2.0 is most likely to decline transactions, especially in a foreign region. It is less likely to challenge users with password authentication, even if \\textsf{machine\\_data} or \\textsf{value} are changed.",

Sibert, Dehornoy, and Girault used this problem in their authentication scheme, which was inspired by the Fiat-Shamir scheme involving repeating several times a three-pass challenge-response step. In this paper, we offer an authentication scheme whose security is based on the apparent hardness of the twisted conjugacy search problem, which is: given a pair of endomorphisms (i.e., homomorphisms into itself) phi, \\psi of a group G and a pair of elements w, t \\in G, find an element s \\in G such that t = \\psi(s^{-1}) w \\phi(s) provided at least one such s exists.

    "abstract": "When users want to establish wireless communication between/among their devices, the channel has to be bootstrapped first. To prevent any malicious control of or eavesdropping over the communication, the channel is desired to be authenticated and confidential. The process of setting up a secure communication channel between two previously unassociated devices is referred to as \"Secure Device Pairing\". When there is no prior security context, e.g., shared secrets, common key servers or public key certificates, device pairing requires user involvement into the process. The idea usually involves leveraging an auxiliary human-perceptible channel to authenticate the data exchanged over the insecure wireless channel. We observe that the focus of prior research has mostly been limited to pairing scenarios where a single user controls both the devices. In this paper, we consider more general and emerging \"two-user\" scenarios, where two different users establish pairing between their respective devices. Although a number of pairing methods exists in the literature, only a handful of those are applicable to the two-user setting. We present the first study to identify the methods practical for two-user pairing scenarios, and comparatively evaluate the usability of these methods. Our results identify methods best-suited for users, in terms of efficiency, error-tolerance and of course, usability. Our work sheds light on the applicability and usability of pairing methods for emerging two-user scenarios, a topic largely ignored so far.",

Soft biometrics is ancillary information that can be combined with primary biometrics to identify a person in a better way. Iris has certain advantage compared to other biometric traits like fingerprint. Iris is an internal part that is less prone to damage. Moreover is very difficult for an attacker to capture an iris.

Almost all the works that have appeared in the literature so far assume the presence of authenticated channels between the parties. This assumption is far from realistic. Two directions of research have been borne from relaxing this (strong) assumption: (a) The adversary is virtually omnipotent and can control all the communication channels in the network, (b) Only a partially connected topology of authenticated channels is guaranteed and adversary controls a subset of the communication channels in the network. This work introduces a new setting for (unconditional) secure multiparty computation problem which is an interesting intermediate model with respect to the above well studied models from the literature (by sharing a salient feature from both the above models). We consider the problem of (unconditional) secure multi-party computation when 'some' of the communication channels connecting the parties can be corrupted passively as well as actively. For this setting, some honest parties may be connected to several other honest parties via corrupted channels and may not be able to authentically communicate with them. Such parties may not be assured the canonical guarantees of correctness or privacy. We present refined definitions of security for this new intermediate model of unconditional multiparty computation. We show how to adapt protocols for (Unconditional) secure multiparty computation to realize the definitions and also argue the tightness of the results achieved by us.",

Regardless of the authentication method used, CEDAR establishes a secure session key, which has the flexibility to be used for multiple capabilities. We demonstrate how a layered approach to security sessions can avoid round-trips and latency inherent in network authentication. The creation of a distinct session management layer allows for optimizations to improve scalability by way of delegating sessions to other components in the system. This session delegation creates a chain of trust that reduces the overhead of establishing secure connections and enables centralized enforcement of system-wide security policies. Additionally, secure channels based upon UDP datagrams are often overlooked by existing libraries; we show how CEDAR's structure accommodates this as well. As an example of the utility of this work, we show how the use of delegated security sessions and other techniques inherent in CEDAR's architecture enables US CMS to meet their scalability requirements in deploying Condor over large-scale, wide-area grid systems.",

The central dogma of our approach can be phrased as follows: Consider a player who diligently executes (only) the delegated protocol but the adversary steals some private information from him. Should such a player be considered faulty? With respect to ABG protocols, we argue that the answer has to be no. In the new model we show that in spite of using unique session identifiers, if $n < 2t$, there cannot exist any ABG protocol that composes in parallel even twice. Further, for $n \\geq 2t$, we design ABG protocols that compose for any number of parallel executions. Besides investigating the composition of ABG under a new light, our work also brings out several new insights into Canetti's Universal Composability framework. Specifically, we show that there are several undesirable effects if one deviates from our dogma.

Moreover, we report on a deficiency in the protocol specifications of UMTS AKA and LTE AKA and the specifications of the core network security (called network domain security), which may enable efficient attacks. The vulnerability allows an inside attacker not only to impersonate an honest protocol participant during a run of the protocol but also to subsequently use wireless services on his behalf. UMTS AKA run over MAP with MAPsec seems vulnerable in the most straight-forward application of the attack. On the other hand, our analysis shows that UMTS and LTE AKA over Diameter/IPsec and UMTS AKA over MAP/TCAPsec (with sufficiently long session identifiers) computationally satisfy intended authentication properties as well as some key secrecy properties, assuming that the used primitives meet standard cryptographic assumptions.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, several protocols for password-based authenticated key exchange have been proposed. These protocols aim to be secure even though the sample space of passwords may be small enough to be enumerated by an off-line adversary. In Eurocrypt 2000, Bellare, Pointcheval and Rogaway (BPR) presented a model and security definition for authenticated key exchange. They claimed that in the ideal-cipher model (random oracles), the two-flow protocol at the core of Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) is secure. Bellare and Rogaway suggested several instantiations of the ideal cipher in their proposal to the IEEE P1363.2 working group. Since then there has been an increased interest in proving the security of password-based protocols in the ideal-cipher model. For example, Bresson, Chevassut, and Pointcheval have recently showed that the One-Encryption-Key-Exchange (OEKE) protocol is secure in the ideal cipher model. In this paper, we present examples of real (NOT ideal) ciphers (including naive implementations of the instantiations proposed to IEEE P1363.2) that would result in broken instantiations of the idealised AuthA protocol and OEKE protocol. Our result shows that the AuthA protocol can be instantiated in an insecure way, and that there are no well defined (let alone rigorous) ways to distinguish between secure and insecure instantiations. Thus, without a rigorous metric for ideal-ciphers, the value of provable security in ideal cipher model is limited.",

    "abstract": "In ubiquitous computing devices, users tend to store some valuable information in their device. Even though the device can be borrowed by the other user temporarily, it is not safe for any user to borrow or lend the device as it may cause private data of the user to be public. To safeguard the user data and also to preserve user privacy we propose and model the technique of ownership authentication transfer. The user who is willing to sell the device has to transfer the ownership of the device under sale. Once the device is sold and the ownership has been transferred, the old owner will not be able to use that device at any cost. Either of the users will not be able to use the device if the process of ownership has not been carried out properly. This also takes care of the scenario when the device has been stolen or lost, avoiding the impersonation attack. The aim of this paper is to model basic process of proposed ownership authentication transfer protocol and check its safety properties by representing it using CSP and model checking approach. For model checking we have used a symbolic model checker tool called NuSMV. The safety properties of ownership transfer protocol has been modeled in terms of CTL specification and it is observed that the system satisfies all the protocol constraint and is safe to be deployed.",

    "abstract": "RFID tags are heavily constrained in computational and storage capabilities, and raise numerous privacy concerns in everyday life due to their vulnerability to different attacks. Both forward security and backward security are required to maintain the privacy of a tag i.e., exposure of a tag's secret key should not reveal the past or future secret keys of the tag. We envisage the need for a formal model for backward security for RFID protocol designs in shared key settings, since the RFID tags are too resource-constrained to support public key settings. However, there has not been much research on backward security for shared key environment since Serge Vaudenay in his Asiacrypt 2007 paper showed that perfect backward security is impossible to achieve without public key settings. We propose a Key-Insulated Mutual Authentication Protocol for shared key environment, KIMAP, which minimizes the damage caused by secret key exposure using insulated keys. Even if a tag's secret key is exposed during an authentication session, forward security and `restricted' backward security of the tag are preserved under our assumptions. The notion of `restricted' backward security is that the adversary misses the protocol transcripts which are needed to update the compromised secret key. Although our definition does not capture perfect backward security, it is still suitable for effective implementation as the tags are highly mobile in practice. We also provide a formal security model of KIMAP. Our scheme is more efficient than previous proposals from the viewpoint of computational requirements.",

    "abstract": "This paper is about authenticating genuine van Gogh paintings from forgeries. The authentication process depends on two key steps: feature extraction and outlier detection. In this paper, a geometric tight frame and some simple statistics of the tight frame coefficients are used to extract features from the paintings. Then a forward stage-wise rank boosting is used to select a small set of features for more accurate classification so that van Gogh paintings are highly concentrated towards some center point while forgeries are spread out as outliers. Numerical results show that our method can achieve 86.08% classification accuracy under the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. Our method also identifies five features that are much more predominant than other features. Using just these five features for classification, our method can give 88.61% classification accuracy which is the highest so far reported in literature. Evaluation of the five features is also performed on two hundred datasets generated by bootstrap sampling with replacement. The median and the mean are 88.61% and 87.77% respectively. Our results show that a small set of statistics of the tight frame coefficients along certain orientations can serve as discriminative features for van Gogh paintings. It is more important to look at the tail distributions of such directional coefficients than mean values and standard deviations. It reflects a highly consistent style in van Gogh's brushstroke movements, where many forgeries demonstrate a more diverse spread in these features.",

    "abstract": "Before deploying a new user authentication scheme, it is critical to subject the scheme to comprehensive study. Few works, however, have undertaken such a study. Recently, Thorpe et al. proposed GeoPass, the most promising of a class of user authentication schemes based on geographic locations in online maps. Their study showed very high memorability (97%) and satisfactory resilience against online guessing, which means that GeoPass has compelling features for real-world use. No comprehensive study, however, has been conducted for GeoPass or any other location-based password scheme. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for the detailed evaluation of a password system, which we implement to study GeoPass. We conducted three separate studies to evaluate the suitability of GeoPass for widespread use. First, we performed a field study over two months, in which users in a real-world setting remembered their location-passwords 96% of the time and showed improvement with more login sessions. Second, we conducted a study to test how users would fare with multiple location-passwords and found that users remembered their location-passwords in less than 70% of login sessions, with 40% of login failures due to interference effects. Third, we conducted a study to examine the resilience of GeoPass against shoulder surfing. Our participants played the role of attackers and had an overall success rate of 48%. Based on our results, we suggest suitable applications of GeoPass in its current state and identify aspects of GeoPass that must be improved before widespread deployment could be considered.",

Today, wireless networks are more prolific, and the monitoring devices used to find them are mobile and easy to access. Securing wireless networks can be difficult because these networks consist of radio transmitters and receivers, and anybody can listen, capture data and attempt to compromise it. In recent years, a range of technologies and mechanisms have helped make networking more secure. This paper holistically evaluated various enhanced protocols proposed to solve WEP related authentication, confidentiality and integrity problems. It discovered that strength of each solution depends on how well the encryption, authentication and integrity techniques work. The work suggested using a Defence-in-Depth Strategy and integration of biometric solution in 802.11i. Comprehensive in-depth comparative analysis of each of the security mechanisms is driven by review of related work in WLAN security solutions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new biometric verification and template protection system which we call the THRIVE system. The system includes novel enrollment and authentication protocols based on threshold homomorphic cryptosystem where the private key is shared between a user and the verifier. In the THRIVE system, only encrypted binary biometric templates are stored in the database and verification is performed via homomorphically randomized templates, thus, original templates are never revealed during the authentication stage. The THRIVE system is designed for the malicious model where the cheating party may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol specification. Since threshold homomorphic encryption scheme is used, a malicious database owner cannot perform decryption on encrypted templates of the users in the database. Therefore, security of the THRIVE system is enhanced using a two-factor authentication scheme involving the user's private key and the biometric data. We prove security and privacy preservation capability of the proposed system in the simulation-based model with no assumption. The proposed system is suitable for applications where the user does not want to reveal her biometrics to the verifier in plain form but she needs to proof her physical presence by using biometrics. The system can be used with any biometric modality and biometric feature extraction scheme whose output templates can be binarized. The overall connection time for the proposed THRIVE system is estimated to be 336 ms on average for 256-bit biohash vectors on a desktop PC running with quad-core 3.2 GHz CPUs at 10 Mbit/s up/down link connection speed. Consequently, the proposed system can be efficiently used in real life applications.",

However, we find that the survey work on the password cracking research has not been done very much. This paper is mainly to give a brief review of the password cracking methods, import technologies of password cracking, and the countermeasures against password cracking that are usually designed at two stages including the password design stage (e.g. user education, dynamic password, use of tokens, computer generations) and after the design (e.g. reactive password checking, proactive password checking, password encryption, access control).

In this paper, we make a further step by proposing a novel artificial-noise-aided PHY-PCRAS (ANA-PHY-PCRAS) for practical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, where the Tikhonov-distributed artificial noise is introduced to interfere with the phase-modulated key for resisting potential key-recovery attacks whenever a static channel between two legitimate users is unfortunately encountered. Then, we address various practical issues for ANA-PHY-PCRAS with OFDM transmission, including correlation among subchannels, imperfect carrier and timing recoveries. Among them, we show that the effect of sampling offset is very significant and a search procedure in the frequency domain should be incorporated for verification. With practical OFDM transmission, the number of uncorrelated subchannels is often not sufficient. Hence, we employ a time-separated approach for allocating enough subchannels and a modified ANA-PHY-PCRAS is proposed to alleviate the discontinuity of channel phase at far-separated time slots. Finally, the key equivocation is derived for the worst case scenario. We conclude that the enhanced security of ANA-PHY-PCRAS comes from the uncertainty of both the wireless channel and introduced artificial noise, compared to the traditional challenge-response authentication scheme implemented at the upper layer.",

The geographical colocation of the subjects in the study is representative of a large closed-world environment such as an organization where the unauthorized user of a device is likely to be an insider threat: coming from within the organization. We consider four biometric modalities: (1) text entered via soft keyboard, (2) applications used, (3) websites visited, and (4) physical location of the device as determined from GPS (when outdoors) or WiFi (when indoors). We implement and test a classifier for each modality and organize the classifiers as a parallel binary decision fusion architecture.

The absence of secure-and-fair billing is one main hurdle to widely adopt this promising technology. This paper introduces a secure and privacy-aware fair billing framework for OLEV on the move through the charging plates installed under the road. We first propose two extreme lightweight mutual authentication mechanisms, a direct authentication and a hash chain-based authentication between vehicles and the charging plates that can be used for different vehicular speeds on the road. Second we propose a secure and privacy-aware wireless power transfer on move for the vehicles with bidirectional auditability guarantee by leveraging game-theoretic approach. Each charging plate transfers a fixed amount of energy to the vehicle and bills the vehicle in a privacy-aware way accordingly. Our protocol guarantees secure, privacy-aware, and fair billing mechanism for the OLEVs while receiving electric power from the road. Moreover our proposed framework can play a vital role in eliminating the security and privacy challenges in the deployment of power transfer technology to the OLEVs.",

    "abstract": "Market research indicates that fingerprints are still the most popular biometric modality for personal authentication. Even with the onset of new modalities (e.g. vein matching), many applications within different domains (e-ID, banking, border control...) and geographies rely on fingerprints obtained from the distal phalanges (a.k.a. sections, digits) of the human hand structure. Motivated by the problem of poor quality distal fingerprint images affecting a non-trivial portion of the population (which decreases associated authentication accuracy), we designed and tested a multifinger, multiphalanx fusion scheme, that combines minutiae matching scores originating from non-distal (ie. middle and proximal) phalanges based on (i) simple sum fusion, (ii) NFIQ image-quality-based fusion, and (iii) phalanx-type-based fusion. Utilizing a medium-size (50 individuals, 400 unique fingers, 1600 distinct images) database collected in our laboratory with a commercial optical fingerprint sensor, and a commercial minutiae extractor & matcher (without any modification), allowed us to simulate a real-world fingerprint authentication setting. Detailed analyses including ROC curves with statistical confidence intervals show that the proposed system can be a viable alternative for cases where (i) distal phalanx images are not usable (e.g. due to missing digits, or low quality finger surface due to manual labor), and (ii) switching to a new biometric modality (e.g. iris) is not possible due to economical or infrastructure limits. Further, we show that when distal phalanx images are in fact usable, combining them with images from other phalanges increases accuracy as well.",

These systems are very popular, as they provide a convenient means for users to log in at RPs and move much of the burden of user authentication from RPs to IdPs. There is, however, a downside to current systems, as they do not respect users' privacy: IdPs learn at which RP a user logs in. With one exception, namely Mozilla's BrowserID system (a.k.a. Mozilla Persona), current SSO systems were not even designed with user privacy in mind. Unfortunately, recently discovered attacks, which exploit design flaws of BrowserID, show that BrowserID does not provide user privacy either. In this paper, we therefore propose the first privacy-respecting SSO system for the web, called SPRESSO (for Secure Privacy-REspecting Single Sign-On). The system is easy to use, decentralized, and platform independent. It is based solely on standard HTML5 and web features and uses no browser extensions, plug-ins, or other executables. Existing SSO systems and the numerous attacks on such systems illustrate that the design of secure SSO systems is highly non-trivial. We therefore also carry out a formal analysis of SPRESSO based on an expressive model of the web in order to formally prove that SPRESSO enjoys strong authentication and privacy properties.",

Despite many research efforts in recent years, it remains a challenging task to design an efficient SCA-WSN scheme that achieves user anonymity. The majority of published SCA-WSN schemes use only lightweight cryptographic techniques (rather than public-key cryptographic techniques) for the sake of efficiency, and have been demonstrated to suffer from the inability to provide user anonymity. Some schemes employ elliptic curve cryptography for better security but require sensors with strict resource constraints to perform computationally expensive scalar-point multiplications; despite the increased computational requirements, these schemes do not provide user anonymity. In this paper, we present a new SCA-WSN scheme that not only achieves user anonymity but also is efficient in terms of the computation loads for sensors. Our scheme employs elliptic curve cryptography but restricts its use only to anonymous user-to-gateway authentication, thereby allowing sensors to perform only lightweight cryptographic operations. Our scheme also enjoys provable security in a formal model extended from the widely accepted Bellare-Pointcheval-Rogaway (2000) model to capture the user anonymity property and various SCA-WSN specific attacks (e.g., stolen smart card attacks, node capture attacks, privileged insider attacks, and stolen verifier attacks).",

A distributed storage system consists of a data owner machine, multiple storage servers and channels to link them. In such a system, secret sharing scheme is widely adopted, in which secret data are split into multiple pieces and stored in each server. To reconstruct them, the data owner should gather plural pieces. Shamir's (k, n)-threshold scheme, in which the data are split into n pieces (shares) for storage and at least k pieces of them must be gathered for reconstruction, furnishes information theoretic security, that is, even if attackers could collect shares of less than the threshold k, they cannot get any information about the data, even with unlimited computing power. Behind this scenario, however, assumed is that data transmission and authentication must be perfectly secure, which is not trivial in practice. Here we propose a totally information theoretically secure distributed storage system based on a user-friendly single-password-authenticated secret sharing scheme and secure transmission using quantum key distribution, and demonstrate it in the Tokyo metropolitan area.",

Therefore they learn image features that effectively predict human visual quality judgments of inauthentic, and usually isolated (single) distortions. However, real-world images usually contain complex, composite mixtures of multiple distortions. We study the perceptually relevant natural scene statistics of such authentically distorted images, in different color spaces and transform domains. We propose a bag of feature-maps approach which avoids assumptions about the type of distortion(s) contained in an image, focusing instead on capturing consistencies, or departures therefrom, of the statistics of real world images. Using a large database of authentically distorted images, human opinions of them, and bags of features computed on them, we train a regressor to conduct image quality prediction. We demonstrate the competence of the features towards improving automatic perceptual quality prediction by testing a learned algorithm using them on a benchmark legacy database as well as on a newly introduced distortion-realistic resource called the LIVE In the Wild Image Quality Challenge Database. We extensively evaluate the perceptual quality prediction model and algorithm and show that it is able to achieve good quality prediction power that is better than other leading models.",

Although they are inexpensive and easy-to-use, security concerns of password-based authentication are serious. Phishing and theft of password databases are two critical concerns. The tendency of users to re-use passwords across different services exacerbates the impact of these two concerns. Current solutions addressing these concerns are not fully satisfactory: they typically address only one of the two concerns; they do not protect passwords from rogue servers; they do not provide any verifiable evidence of their (server-side) adoption to users; and they face deployability challenges in terms of the cost for service providers and/or ease-of-use for end users. We present SafeKeeper, a comprehensive approach to protect the confidentiality of passwords in web authentication systems. Unlike previous approaches, SafeKeeper protects user passwords against very strong adversaries, including rogue servers and sophisticated external phishers. It is relatively inexpensive to deploy as it (i) uses widely available hardware security mechanisms like Intel SGX, (ii) is integrated into popular web platforms like WordPress, and (iii) has small performance overhead. We describe a variety of challenges in designing and implementing such a system, and how we overcome them. Through an 86-participant user study, and systematic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate the usability, security and deployability of SafeKeeper, which is available as open-source.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, due to the trend in globalization, system integrators have had to deal with integrated circuit (IC)/intellectual property (IP) counterfeiting more than ever. These counterfeit hardware issues counterfeit hardware that have driven the need for more secure chip authentication. High entropy random numbers from physical sources are a critical component in authentication and encryption processes within secure systems [6]. Secure encryption is dependent on sources of truly random numbers for generating keys, and there is a need for an on chip random number generator to achieve adequate security. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) adopts a large number of these hardware-based security and prevention solutions in order to securely exchange data in resource efficient manner. In this work, we have developed several methodologies of hardware-based random functions in order to address the issues and enhance the security and trust of ICs: a novel DRAM-based intrinsic Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) [13] for system level security and authentication along with analysis of the impact of various environmental conditions, particularly silicon aging; a DRAM remanence based True Random Number Generation (TRNG) to produce random sequences with a very low overhead; a DRAM TRNG model using its startup value behavior for creating random bit streams; an efficient power supply noise based TRNG model for generating an infinite number of random bits which has been evaluated as a cost effective technique; architectures and hardware security solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Since IoT devices are heavily resource constrained, our proposed designs can alleviate the concerns of establishing trustworthy and security in an efficient and low-cost manner.",

    "abstract": "Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a key technology for next generation wireless broadband networks showing rapid progress and inspiring numerous compelling applications. A WMN comprises of a set of mesh routers (MRs) and mesh clients (MCs), where MRs are connected to the Internet backbone through the Internet gateways (IGWs). The MCs are wireless devices and communicate among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths with or without the involvement of MRs. User privacy and security have been primary concerns in WMNs due to their peer-to-peer network topology, shared wireless medium, stringent resource constraints, and highly dynamic environment. Moreover, to support real-time applications, WMNs must also be equipped with robust, reliable and efficient communication protocols so as to minimize the end-to-end latency and packet drops. Design of a secure and efficient communication protocol for WMNs, therefore, is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a security and privacy protocol that provides security and user anonymity while maintaining communication efficiency in a WMN. The security protocol ensures secure authentication and encryption in access and the backbone networks. The user anonymity, authentication and data privacy is achieved by application of a protocol that is based on Rivest's ring signature scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that while the protocols have minimal storage and communication overhead, they are robust and provide high level of security and privacy to the users of the network services.",

    ],
    "abstract": "The Austrian eID system constitutes a main pillar within the Austrian e-Government strategy. The eID system ensures unique identification and secure authentication for citizens protecting access to applications where sensitive and personal data is involved. In particular, the Austrian eID system supports three main use cases: Identification and authentication of Austrian citizens, electronic representation, and foreign citizen authentication at Austrian public sector applications. For supporting all these use cases, several components -- either locally deployed in the applications' domain or centrally deployed -- need to communicate with each other. While local deployments have some advantages in terms of scalability, still a central deployment of all involved components would be advantageous, e.g. due to less maintenance efforts. However, a central deployment can easily lead to load bottlenecks because theoretically the whole Austrian population as well as -- for foreign citizens -- the whole EU population could use the provided services. To mitigate the issue on scalability, in this paper we propose the migration of main components of the ecosystem into a public cloud. However, a move of trusted services into a public cloud brings up new obstacles, particular with respect to privacy. To bypass the issue on privacy, in this paper we propose an approach on how the complete Austrian eID ecosystem can be moved into a public cloud in a privacy-preserving manner by applying selected cryptographic technologies (in particular using proxy re-encryption and redactable signatures). Applying this approach, no sensitive data will be disclosed to a public cloud provider by still supporting all three main eID system use cases. We finally discuss our approach based on selected criteria.",

    "abstract": "Wine counterfeiting has been posing significant challenges to wine industry, and has undermined the international wine trading market and the global economy hugely. The situation of counterfeiting has even been exacerbating in wine industry and global supply chain. There has been a number of anti-counterfeiting approaches which have been proposed and adopted utilizing different authentication technologies, in response to growing threats of counterfeiting to wine industry. The proposed NFC-Enabled Anti-Counterfeiting System (NAS) is developed for luxury-good industry such as wine industry, aiming at upholding provenance and authenticity of wine products from counterfeits via the product pedigree, transaction records and supply chain integrity maintained along the supply chain. Consumers can therefore safeguard their stake by authenticating a specific wine product with their NFC-enabled smartphones before purchasing at the retail points. NAS utilizes Near-field Communication (NFC), which has emerged as a promising technology and communication protocol for developing innovative alternatives, to facilitate the wine record processing of wine products and in turn combat wine and spirit counterfeiting. The integrated NAS is consisted of a wide range of hardware and software components, and the best combination of settings, parameters and deployments will therefore be identified. Other possible implementation issues, such as tag selection, tag programming and encryption, setup of back-end database servers and the design of NFC mobile application will also be discussed in this project. The critical design of NAS is vital not only to the key of product anti-counterfeiting of wine industry, but also to the strong foundation for other innovative supply chain solutions, such as the NFC-enabled purchasing system, developed on top of NAS with improved and integrated anti-counterfeiting functionalities.",

    "abstract": "We model (interactive) resources that provide Alice with a string $X$ and a guarantee that any Eve interacting with her interface of the resource obtains a (quantum) system $E$ such that the conditional (smooth) min-entropy of $X$ given $E$ is lower bounded by some $k$. This (abstract) resource specification encompasses any setting that results in the honest players holding such a string (or aborting). For example, it could be constructed from, e.g., noisy channels, quantum key distribution (QKD), or a violation of Bell inequalities, which all may be used to derive bounds on the min-entropy of $X$. As a first application, we use this min-entropy resource to modularize key distribution (KD) schemes by dividing them in two parts, which may be analyzed separately. In the first part, a KD protocol constructs a min-entropy resource given the (physical) resources available in the specific setting considered. In the second, it distills secret key from the min-entropy resource---i.e., it constructs a secret key resource. We prove security for a generic key distillation protocol that may use any min-entropy resource. Since the notion of resource construction is composable---security of a composed protocol follows from the security of its parts--- this reduces proving security of a KD protocol (e.g., QKD) to proving that it constructs a min-entropy resource. As a second application, we provide a composable security proof for the recent Fehr-Salvail protocol [EUROCRYPT 2017] that authenticates classical messages with a quantum message authentication code (Q-MAC), and recycles all the key upon successfully verifying the authenticity of the message. This protocol uses (and recycles) a non-uniform key, which we model as consuming and constructing a min-entropy resource.",

    "abstract": "Embedded systems play a crucial role in fueling the growth of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) in application domains such as healthcare, home automation, transportation, etc. However, their increasingly network-connected nature, coupled with their ability to access potentially sensitive/confidential information, has given rise to many security and privacy concerns. An additional challenge is the growing number of counterfeit components in these devices, resulting in serious reliability and financial implications. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a promising security primitive to help address these concerns. Memory-based PUFs are particularly attractive as they require minimal or no additional hardware for their operation. However, current memory-based PUFs utilize only a single memory technology for constructing the PUF, which has several disadvantages including making them vulnerable to security attacks. In this paper, we propose the design of a new memory-based combination PUF that intelligently combines two memory technologies, SRAM and DRAM, to overcome these shortcomings. The proposed combination PUF exhibits high entropy, supports a large number of challenge-response pairs, and is intrinsically reconfigurable. We have implemented the proposed combination PUF using a Terasic TR4-230 FPGA board and several off-the-shelf SRAMs and DRAMs. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over current memory-based PUFs including the ability to resist various attacks. Extensive authentication tests across a wide temperature range (20 - 60 deg. Celsius) and accelerated aging (12 months) demonstrate the robustness of the proposed design, which achieves a 100% true-positive rate and 0% false-positive rate for authentication across these parameter ranges.",

Traditionally, the authentication problem is solved by means of a cryptographic protocol. However, the computational complexity of cryptographic protocols and/or scalability problems related to key management, render almost all cryptography based authentication protocols impractical for IoT. The problem of device identification is, on the other hand, sadly neglected. We believe that device fingerprinting can be used to solve both these problems effectively. In this work, we present a methodology to perform device behavioral fingerprinting that can be employed to undertake device type identification. A device behavior is approximated using features extracted from the network traffic of the device. These features are used to train a machine learning model that can be used to detect similar device types. We validate our approach using five-fold cross validation; we report a identification rate of 86-99% and a mean accuracy of 99%, across all our experiments. Our approach is successful even when a device uses encrypted communication. Furthermore, we show preliminary results for fingerprinting device categories, i.e., identifying different device types having similar functionality.",

    "abstract": "Scribble colors based line art colorization is a challenging computer vision problem since neither greyscale values nor semantic information is presented in line arts, and the lack of authentic illustration-line art training pairs also increases difficulty of model generalization. Recently, several Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) based methods have achieved great success. They can generate colorized illustrations conditioned on given line art and color hints. However, these methods fail to capture the authentic illustration distributions and are hence perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they often lack accurate shading. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep conditional adversarial architecture for scribble based anime line art colorization. Specifically, we integrate the conditional framework with WGAN-GP criteria as well as the perceptual loss to enable us to robustly train a deep network that makes the synthesized images more natural and real. We also introduce a local features network that is independent of synthetic data. With GANs conditioned on features from such network, we notably increase the generalization capability over \"in the wild\" line arts. Furthermore, we collect two datasets that provide high-quality colorful illustrations and authentic line arts for training and benchmarking. With the proposed model trained on our illustration dataset, we demonstrate that images synthesized by the presented approach are considerably more realistic and precise than alternative approaches.",

To enhance SSA, the dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS) framework couples on-line data with off-line models to enhance system performance. Using feedback control, sensor management, and communications reliability. For information management, there is a need for identity authentication and access control to ensure the integrity of exchanged data as well as to grant authorized entities access right to data and services. Due to decentralization and heterogeneity of SSA systems, it is challenging to build an efficient centralized access control system, which could either be a performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. Inspired by the blockchain and smart contract technology, this paper introduces BlendCAC, a decentralized authentication and capability-based access control mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services and information in SSA networks. To achieve secure identity authentication, the BlendCAC leverages the blockchain to create virtual trust zones and a robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices and more powerful computing devices, and is tested on a private Ethereum blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the BlendCAC scheme to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine-grained access control solution for space system towards SSA.",

The prevalence of techniques like return-oriented programming (ROP) in attacking real-world systems has prompted major processor manufacturers to design hardware-based countermeasures against specific classes of run-time attacks. An example is the recently added support for pointer authentication (PA) in the ARMv8-A processor architecture, commonly used in devices like smartphones. PA is a low-cost technique to authenticate pointers so as to resist memory vulnerabilities. It has been shown to enable practical protection against memory vulnerabilities that corrupt return addresses or function pointers. However, so far, PA has received very little attention as a general purpose protection mechanism to harden software against various classes of memory attacks. In this paper, we use PA to build novel defenses against various classes of run-time attacks, including the first PA-based mechanism for data pointer integrity. We present PARTS, an instrumentation framework that integrates our PA-based defenses into the LLVM compiler and the GNU/Linux operating system and show, via systematic evaluation, that PARTS provides better protection than current solutions at a reasonable performance overhead",

    "abstract": "Shoulder surfing is an attack vector widely recognized as a real threat - enough to warrant researchers dedicating a considerable effort toward designing novel authentication methods to be shoulder surfing resistant. Despite a multitude of proposed solutions over the years, few have employed empirical evaluations and comparisons between different methods, and our understanding of the shoulder surfing phenomenon remains limited. Barring the challenges in experimental design, the reason for that can be primarily attributed to the lack of objective and comparable vulnerability measures. In this paper, we develop an ensemble of vulnerability metrics, a first endeavour toward a comprehensive assessment of a given method's susceptibility to observational attacks. In the largest on-site shoulder surfing experiment (n = 274) to date, we verify the model on four conceptually different authentication methods in two observation scenarios. On the example of a novel hybrid authentication method based on associations, we explore the effect of input type on the adversary's effectiveness. We provide first empirical evidence that graphical passwords are easier to observe; however, that does not necessarily mean that the observed information will allow the attacker to guess the victim's password easier. An in-depth analysis of individual metrics within the clusters offers insight into many additional aspects of the shoulder surfing attack not explored before. Our comparative framework makes an advancement in evaluation of shoulder surfing and furthers our understanding of observational attacks. The results have important implications for future shoulder surfing studies and the field of Password Security as a whole.",

While the majority of research focuses on smart IoT devices, treatments for legacy dumb network-ready devices are lacking; moreover, IoT devices deployed in a hostile environment are often required to be dumb due to the strict hardware constraints, making them highly vulnerable to cyber attacks. To mitigate the problem, we propose a light-weight authentication scheme for dumb IoT devices, in a case study of the UAV-sensor collaborative RISTA missions. Our scheme utilizes the covert channels in the physical layer for authentications and does not request conventional key deployments, key generations which may cause security risks and large overhead that a dumb sensor cannot afford. Our scheme operates on the physical layer, and thus it is highly portable and generalizable to most commercial and military communication protocols. We demonstrate the viability of our scheme by building a prototype system and conducting experiments to emulate the behaviors of UAVs and sensors in real scenarios.",

Together, all Charlotte blocks form a directed acyclic graph, the blockweb; all observers and applications use subgraphs of the blockweb for their own data structures. Unlike prior systems, Charlotte data structures are composable: applications and data structures can operate fully independently when possible, and share blocks when desired. To support this composability, we define a language-independent format for Charlotte blocks and a network API for Charlotte servers. An authenticated distributed data structure guarantees that data is immutable and self-authenticating: data referenced will be unchanged when it is retrieved. Charlotte extends these guarantees by allowing applications to plug in their own mechanisms for ensuring availability and integrity of data structures. Unlike most traditional distributed systems, including distributed databases, blockchains, and distributed hash tables, Charlotte supports heterogeneous trust: different observers may have their own beliefs about who might fail, and how. Despite heterogeneity of trust, Charlotte presents each observer with a consistent, available view of data. We demonstrate the flexibility of Charlotte by implementing a variety of integrity mechanisms, including consensus and proof of work. We study the power of disentangling availability and integrity mechanisms by building a variety of applications. The results from these examples suggest that developers can use Charlotte to build flexible, fast, composable applications with strong guarantees.",

With this in mind, we have developed a solution for managing user profiles based on privacy and evolution. For that, we define the criteria and characteristics for each environment. The contribution of the work also applies to the evolution of the UbiPri Middleware, with a module implemented and tested according to the rules of environments so that they can modify the user's profile over time according to their frequency in the environment. The modified profile can be raised, reduced and blocked. This implementation has been validated using scripts that perform probabilistic simulation and user authentication. From the rules assigned to the environments, it was possible to perceive the high adaptability of the implementation, and it can be easily adjusted to any IoT environment that wants to treat the authentication and privacy of environments and users. The results obtained were satisfactory and could be useful for both the evolution of the UbiPri Middleware and other related works.",

In this work, we perform a black-box timing analysis of TPM 2.0 devices deployed on commodity computers. Our analysis reveals that some of these devices feature secret-dependent execution times during signature generation based on elliptic curves. In particular, we discovered timing leakage on an Intel firmware-based TPM as well as a hardware TPM. We show how this information allows an attacker to apply lattice techniques to recover 256-bit private keys for ECDSA and ECSchnorr signatures. On Intel fTPM, our key recovery succeeds after about 1,300 observations and in less than two minutes. Similarly, we extract the private ECDSA key from a hardware TPM manufactured by STMicroelectronics, which is certified at Common Criteria (CC) EAL 4+, after fewer than 40,000 observations. We further highlight the impact of these vulnerabilities by demonstrating a remote attack against a StrongSwan IPsec VPN that uses a TPM to generate the digital signatures for authentication. In this attack, the remote client recovers the server's private authentication key by timing only 45,000 authentication handshakes via a network connection. The vulnerabilities we have uncovered emphasize the difficulty of correctly implementing known constant-time techniques, and show the importance of evolutionary testing and transparent evaluation of cryptographic implementations. Even certified devices that claim resistance against attacks require additional scrutiny by the community and industry, as we learn more about these attacks.",

    "abstract": "Many IoT use cases involve constrained battery-powered devices offering services in a RESTful manner to their communication partners. Such services may involve, e.g., costly computations or actuator/sensor usage, which may have significant influence on the power consumption of the service Providers. Remote attackers may excessively use those services in order to exhaust the Providers' batteries, which is a form of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Previous work proposed solutions based on lightweight symmetric authentication. These solutions scale poorly due to requiring pre-shared keys and do not provide protection against compromised service Requesters. In contrast, we consider more powerful attackers even capable of compromising legit Requesters. We propose a method that combines attacker detection and throttling, conducted by a third trusted Backend, with a lightweight authentication protocol. For attacker detection and throttling, we propose a novel approach using rate limitation algorithms. In addition, we propose and formally verify two authentication protocols suitable for different, widely used IoT network topologies. Our protocols ensure service availability for benign Requesters even if Providers are under a battery exhaustion attack. The protocols do neither require pre-shared keys between Requesters and Providers, nor the usage of asymmetric cryptography and public key infrastructures on the Provider. This makes our protocols suitable for a variety of IoT deployments involving constrained devices and constrained networks. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method through a simulation and a proof of concept implementation.",

The mobile payment, mobile security and privacy protection have become the focus of widespread attention. Iris recognition becomes a high-security authentication technology in these fields, it is widely used in distinct science fields in biometric authentication fields. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the mainstream deep learning approaches for image recognition, whereas its anti-noise ability is weak and needs a certain amount of memory to train in image classification tasks. Under these conditions we put forward a fine-tuning neural network model based on the Mask R-CNN and Inception V4 neural network model, which integrates every component in an overall system that combines the iris detection, extraction, and recognition function as an iris recognition system. The proposed framework has the characteristics of scalability and high availability; it not only can learn part-whole relationships of the iris image but also enhancing the robustness of the whole framework. Importantly, the proposed model can be trained using the different spectrum of samples, such as Visible Wavelength (VW) and Near Infrared (NIR) iris biometric databases. The recognition average accuracy of 99.10% is achieved while executing in the mobile edge calculation device of the Jetson Nano.",

The method was not able to utilize the available huge amount of monolingual data because of the inability of models to differentiate between the authentic and synthetic parallel data. Tagging, or using gates, has been used to enable translation models to distinguish between synthetic and authentic data, improving standard back-translation and also enabling the use of iterative back-translation on language pairs that under-performed using standard back-translation. This work presents pre-training and fine-tuning as a simplified but more effective approach of differentiating between the two data. The approach - tag-less back-translation - trains the model on the synthetic data and fine-tunes it on the authentic data. Experiments have shown the approach to outperform the baseline and standard back-translation by 4.0 and 0.7 BLEU respectively on low resource English-Vietnamese NMT. While the need for tagging (noising) the dataset has been removed, the technique outperformed tagged back-translation by 0.4 BLEU. The approach reached the best scores in less training time than the standard and tagged back-translation approaches.",

SRP is a widely deployed Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol used in 1Password, iCloud Keychain, and other products. As with many PAKE protocols, two participants use knowledge of a pre-shared password to authenticate each other and establish a session key. SRP aims to resist dictionary attacks, not store plaintext-equivalent passwords on the server, avoid patent infringement, and avoid export controls by not using encryption. Formal analysis of SRP is challenging in part because existing tools provide no simple way to reason about its use of the mathematical expression $v + g^b \\mod q$. Modeling $v + g^b$ as encryption, we complete an exhaustive study of all possible execution sequences of SRP. Ignoring possible algebraic attacks, this analysis detects no major structural weakness, and in particular no leakage of any secrets. We do uncover one notable weakness of SRP, which follows from its design constraints. It is possible for a malicious server to fake an authentication session with a client, without the client's participation. This action might facilitate an escalation of privilege attack, if the client has higher privileges than does the server. We conceived of this attack before we used CPSA and confirmed it by generating corresponding execution shapes using CPSA.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Device Authentication Code (DAC), a novel method for authenticating IoT devices with wireless interface by exploiting their radio frequency (RF) signatures. The proposed DAC is based on RF fingerprinting, information theoretic method, feature learning, and discriminatory power of deep learning. Specifically, an autoencoder is used to automatically extract features from the RF traces, and the reconstruction error is used as the DAC and this DAC is unique to the device and the particular message of interest. Then Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is used to match the distribution of the reconstruction error generated by the autoencoder and the received message, and the result will determine whether the device of interest belongs to an authorized user. We validate this concept on two experimentally collected RF traces from six ZigBee and five universal software defined radio peripheral (USRP) devices, respectively. The traces span a range of Signalto- Noise Ratio by varying locations and mobility of the devices and channel interference and noise to ensure robustness of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that DAC is able to prevent device impersonation by extracting salient features that are unique to any wireless device of interest and can be used to identify RF devices. Furthermore, the proposed method does not need the RF traces of the intruder during model training yet be able to identify devices not seen during training, which makes it practical.",

We formulate an optimization problem at the baseband correlator domain by using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). We model correlator tap outputs of the received signal to form a dictionary of triangle-shaped functions and leverage sparse signal processing to choose a decomposition of shifted matching triangles from said dictionary. The optimal solution of this minimization problem discriminates the presence of a potential spoofing attack peak by observing a decomposition of two different code-phase values (authentic and spoofed) in a sparse vector output. We use a threshold to mitigate false alarms. Furthermore, we present a variation of the minimization problem by enhancing the dictionary to a higher-resolution of shifted triangles. The proposed technique can be implemented as an advanced fine-acquisition monitoring tool to aid in the tracking loops for spoofing mitigation. In our experiments, we are able to distinguish authentic and spoofer peaks from synthetic data simulations and from a real dataset, namely, the Texas Spoofing Test Battery (TEXBAT).

Existing research relies on building machine learning classifiers to recognize an individual's unique patterns. However, these classifiers are not powerful enough to learn the discriminative features. When implemented on the mobile devices, they face new challenges from the behavioral dynamics, data privacy and side-channel leaks. To address these challenges, we present a new framework to incorporate training on battery-powered mobile devices, so private data never leaves the device and training can be flexibly scheduled to adapt the behavioral patterns at runtime. We re-formulate the classification problem into deep metric learning to improve the discriminative power and design an effective countermeasure to thwart side-channel leaks by embedding a noise signature in the sensing signals without sacrificing too much usability. The experiments demonstrate authentication accuracy over 95% on three public datasets, a sheer 15% gain from multi-class classification with less data and robustness against brute-force and side-channel attacks with 99% and 90% success, respectively. We show the feasibility of training with mobile CPUs, where training 100 epochs takes less than 10 mins and can be boosted 3-5 times with feature transfer. Finally, we profile memory, energy and computational overhead. Our results indicate that training consumes lower energy than watching videos and slightly higher energy than playing games.",

    "abstract": "Previous works on the CERT insider threat detection case have neglected graph and text features despite their relevance to describe user behavior. Additionally, existing systems heavily rely on feature engineering and audit data aggregation to detect malicious activities. This is time consuming, requires expert knowledge and prevents tracing back alerts to precise user actions. To address these issues we introduce ADSAGE to detect anomalies in audit log events modeled as graph edges. Our general method is the first to perform anomaly detection at edge level while supporting both edge sequences and attributes, which can be numeric, categorical or even text. We describe how ADSAGE can be used for fine-grained, event level insider threat detection in different audit logs from the CERT use case. Remarking that there is no standard benchmark for the CERT problem, we use a previously proposed evaluation setting based on realistic recall-based metrics. We evaluate ADSAGE on authentication, email traffic and web browsing logs from the CERT insider threat datasets, as well as on real-world authentication events. ADSAGE is effective to detect anomalies in authentications, modeled as user to computer interactions, and in email communications. Simple baselines give surprisingly strong results as well. We also report performance split by malicious scenarios present in the CERT datasets: interestingly, several detectors are complementary and could be combined to improve detection. Overall, our results show that graph features are informative to characterize malicious insider activities, and that detection at fine-grained level is possible.",

Traditional encryption algorithms require sensitive information such as keys to be stored in memory, and also need the support of operating system, which is obviously unacceptable for resource-constrained Internet of Things terminals. Physical not cloning function by extracting the chip is inevitable in the process of manufacturing process deviation, the introduction of the corresponding function relationship between incentive and response, not to need the storage user sensitive information, and only when electricity will respond, in power response immediately disappear, this can save a lot of resources of equipment and the power consumption. However, PUF is vulnerable to modeling attacks, and the traditional methods such as the challenge obfuscation method are time-invariant, which is equivalent to adding a fixed function to the front stage of a traditional APUF circuit. Therefore, it can be potentially modelling attacked with sufficient CRPs. In order to further enhance APUF circuit resistance to modelling attack, this paper proposes a dual-LFSR-based APUF circuit with time-variant challenge obfuscation. Besides, traditional authentication scheme generally adopts the one-time key scheme to enhance resistance to man-in-the-middle attack. The two-time authentication scheme proposed in this paper can improve the ability of RFID system to resist man-in-the-middle attack without sacrificing CRPs.",

People are encouraged to cover their faces when in public area to avoid the spread of infection. The use of these face masks has raised a serious question on the accuracy of the facial recognition system used for tracking school/office attendance and to unlock phones. Many organizations use facial recognition as a means of authentication and have already developed the necessary datasets in-house to be able to deploy such a system. Unfortunately, masked faces make it difficult to be detected and recognized, thereby threatening to make the in-house datasets invalid and making such facial recognition systems inoperable. This paper addresses a methodology to use the current facial datasets by augmenting it with tools that enable masked faces to be recognized with low false-positive rates and high overall accuracy, without requiring the user dataset to be recreated by taking new pictures for authentication. We present an open-source tool, MaskTheFace to mask faces effectively creating a large dataset of masked faces. The dataset generated with this tool is then used towards training an effective facial recognition system with target accuracy for masked faces. We report an increase of 38% in the true positive rate for the Facenet system. We also test the accuracy of re-trained system on a custom real-world dataset MFR2 and report similar accuracy.",

Specifically, we consider a single-reader, single-tag RFID system whereby the reader and the tag undergo two-way signaling which enables the reader to extract the tag ID in order to authenticate the legitimate tag (L-tag). We then consider a scenario whereby a malicious tag (M-tag)---having the same ID as the L-tag programmed in its memory by a wizard---attempts to deceive the reader by pretending to be the L-tag. To this end, we counter the identity attack by exploiting the non-reciprocity of the end-to-end channel (i.e., the residual channel) between the reader and the tag as the fingerprint of the tag. The passive nature of the tag(s) (and thus, lack of any computational platform at the tag) implies that the proposed light-weight physical-layer authentication method is implemented at the reader. To be concrete, in our proposed scheme, the reader acquires the raw data via two-way (challenge-response) message exchange mechanism, does least-squares estimation to extract the fingerprint, and does binary hypothesis testing to do authentication. We also provide closed-form expressions for the two error probabilities of interest (i.e., false alarm and missed detection). Simulation results attest to the efficacy of the proposed method.",

In this study, we focus on deep learning methods for explicit authentication based on motion sensor signals. In this scenario, attackers could craft adversarial examples with the aim of gaining unauthorized access and even restraining a legitimate user to access his mobile device. To our knowledge, this is the first study that aims at quantifying the impact of adversarial attacks on machine learning models used for user identification based on motion sensors. To accomplish our goal, we study multiple methods for generating adversarial examples. We propose three research questions regarding the impact and the universality of adversarial examples, conducting relevant experiments in order to answer our research questions. Our empirical results demonstrate that certain adversarial example generation methods are specific to the attacked classification model, while others tend to be generic. We thus conclude that deep neural networks trained for user identification tasks based on motion sensors are subject to a high percentage of misclassification when given adversarial input.",

We leverage user's inherent capabilities of identifying fake news and propose a warning-based control mechanism to curb this spread. Warnings are based on previous users' responses that indicate the authenticity of the news. We use population-size dependent continuous-time multi-type branching processes to describe the spreading under the warning mechanism. We also have new results towards these branching processes. The (time) asymptotic proportions of the individual populations are derived. These results are instrumental in deriving relevant type-1, type-2 performance measures, and formulating an optimization problem to design optimal warning parameters. The fraction of copies tagged as real (fake) are considered for the type-1 (type-2) performance. We derive structural properties of the performance, which help simplify the optimization problem. We finally demonstrate that the optimal warning mechanism effectively mitigates fake news, with negligible influences on the propagation of authentic news. We validate performance measures using Monte Carlo simulations on ego-network database related to Twitter.",

With the adoption of Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) in Galileo, the E1B signal component will continuously broadcast unpredictable cryptographic data. This allows GNSS receivers not only to ensure the authenticity of data origin but also to detect replay spoofing attacks for receivers already tracking real signals with relatively good visibility conditions. Since the spoofer needs to estimate the unpredictable bits introduced by OSNMA with almost zero delay in order to perform a Security Code Estimation and Replay (SCER) attack, the spoofer unavoidably introduces a slight distortion into the signal, which can be the basis of a spoofing detector. In this work, we propose five detectors based on partial correlations of GNSS signals obtained over predictable and unpredictable parts of the signals. We evaluate them in a wide set of test cases, including different types of receiver and spoofing conditions. The results show that one of the detectors is consistently superior to the others, and it is able to detect SCER attacks with a high probability even in favorable conditions for the spoofer. Finally, we discuss some practical considerations for implementing the proposed detector in receivers, in particular when the Galileo OSNMA message structure is used.",

Accordingly, security between such tags and readers have primarily been studied among many issues of RFID. However, the authenticity of data cannot be guaranteed if logistics services can give false information. Although the use of blockchain is often discussed, it is simply a recording system, so there is a risk that false records may be written to it. As a solution, we propose a design in which a digitally signing, location-constrained and tamper-evident reader atomically writes an evidence to blockchain along with its reading and writing a tag. By semi-formal modeling, we confirmed that the confidentiality and integrity of the information can be maintained throughout the system, and digitally signed data can be verified later despite possible compromise of private keys or signature algorithms, or expiration of public key certificates. We also introduce a prototype design to show that our proposal is viable. This makes it possible to trace authentic logistics information using inexpensive passive RFID tags. Furthermore, by abstracting the reader/writer as a sensor/actuator, this model can be extended to IoT in general.",

An email's authenticity is based on an authentication chain involving multiple protocols, roles and services, the inconsistency among which creates security threats. Thus, it depends on the weakest link of the chain, as any failed part can break the whole chain-based defense. This paper systematically analyzes the transmission of an email and identifies a series of new attacks capable of bypassing SPF, DKIM, DMARC and user-interface protections. In particular, by conducting a \"cocktail\" joint attack, more realistic emails can be forged to penetrate the celebrated email services, such as Gmail and Outlook. We conduct a large-scale experiment on 30 popular email services and 23 email clients, and find that all of them are vulnerable to certain types of new attacks. We have duly reported the identified vulnerabilities to the related email service providers, and received positive responses from 11 of them, including Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud and Alibaba. Furthermore, we propose key mitigating measures to defend against the new attacks. Therefore, this work is of great value for identifying email spoofing attacks and improving the email ecosystem's overall security.",

    "abstract": "Biometric systems based on Machine learning and Deep learning are being extensively used as authentication mechanisms in resource-constrained environments like smartphones and other small computing devices. These AI-powered facial recognition mechanisms have gained enormous popularity in recent years due to their transparent, contact-less and non-invasive nature. While they are effective to a large extent, there are ways to gain unauthorized access using photographs, masks, glasses, etc. In this paper, we propose an alternative authentication mechanism that uses both facial recognition and the unique movements of that particular face while uttering a password, that is, the temporal facial feature movements. The proposed model is not inhibited by language barriers because a user can set a password in any language. When evaluated on the standard MIRACL-VC1 dataset, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 98.1%, underscoring its effectiveness as an effective and robust system. The proposed method is also data-efficient since the model gave good results even when trained with only 10 positive video samples. The competence of the training of the network is also demonstrated by benchmarking the proposed system against various compounded Facial recognition and Lip reading models.",

    "abstract": "Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a promising concept to meet the challenges in next-generation wireless networks such as providing flexible, adaptive, and reconfigurable architecture while offering cost-effective solutions to service providers. As WMNs become an increasingly popular replacement technology for last-mile connectivity to the home networking, community and neighborhood networking, it is imperative to design efficient and secure communication protocols for these networks. However, several vulnerabilities exist in currently existing protocols for WMNs. These security loopholes can be exploited by potential attackers to launch attack on WMNs. The absence of a central point of administration makes securing WMNs even more challenging. The broadcast nature of transmission and the dependency on the intermediate nodes for multi-hop communications lead to several security vulnerabilities in WMNs. The attacks can be external as well as internal in nature. External attacks are launched by intruders who are not authorized users of the network. For example, an intruding node may eavesdrop on the packets and replay those packets at a later point of time to gain access to the network resources. On the other hand, the internal attacks are launched by the nodes that are part of the WMN. On example of such attack is an intermediate node dropping packets which it was supposed to forward. This chapter presents a comprehensive discussion on the current authentication and privacy protection schemes for WMN. In addition, it proposes a novel security protocol for node authentication and message confidentiality and an anonymization scheme for privacy protection of users in WMNs.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the security of the authentication code against pollution attacks in network coding given by Oggier and Fathi and show one way to remove one very strong condition they required. Actually, we find a way to attack their authentication scheme. In their scheme, they considered that if some malicious nodes in the network collude to make pollution in the network flow or make substitution attacks to other nodes, they thought these malicious nodes must solve a system of linear equations to recover the secret parameters. Then they concluded that their scheme is an unconditional secure scheme. Actually, note that the authentication tag in the scheme of Oggier and Fathi is nearly linear on the messages, so it is very easy for any malicious node to make pollution attack in the network flow, replacing the vector of any incoming edge by linear combination of his incoming vectors whose coefficients have sum 1. And if the coalition of malicious nodes can carry out decoding of the network coding, they can easily make substitution attack to any other node even if they do not know any information of the private key of the node. Moreover, even if their scheme can work fruitfully, the condition in their scheme $H\\leqslant M$ in a network can be removed, where $H$ is the sum of numbers of the incoming edges at adversaries. Under the condition $H\\leqslant M$, $H$ may be large, so we need large parameter $M$ which increases the cost of computation a lot. On the other hand, the parameter $M$ can not be very large as it can not exceed the length of original messages.",

    "abstract": "OAuth is the new de facto standard for delegating authorization in the web. An important limitation of OAuth is the fact that it was designed for authorization and not for authentication. The usage of OAuth for authentication thus leads to serious vulnerabilities as shown by Zhou et. al. in [44] and Chen et. al. in [9]. OpenID Connect was created on top of OAuth to fill this gap by providing federated identity management and user authentication. OpenID Connect was standardized in February 2014, but leading companies like Google, Microsoft, AOL and PayPal are already using it in their web applications [1], [2], [3], [30]. In this paper we describe the OpenID Connect protocol and provide the first in-depth analysis of one of the key features of OpenID Connect: the Discovery and the Dynamic Registration extensions.We present a new class of attacks on OpenID Connect that belong to the category of second-order vulnerabilities. These attacks consist of two phases: First, the injection payload is stored by the legitimate application. Later on, this payload is used in a security-critical operation. Our new class of attacks - called Malicious Endpoints attacks - exploits the OpenID Connect extensions Discovery and Dynamic Registration. These attacks break user authentication, compromise user privacy, and enable Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), client-side code injection, and Denial-of-Service (DoS). As a result, the security of the OpenID Connect protocol cannot be guaranteed when these extensions are enabled in their present form. We contacted the authors of the OpenID Connect and OAuth specifications. They acknowledged our Malicious Endpoint attacks and recognized the need to improve the specification [29]. We are currently involved in the discussion regarding the mitigation of the existing issues and an extension to the OAuth specification.",

    "abstract": "Zero-interaction authentication (ZIA) refers to a form of user-transparent login mechanism using which a terminal (e.g., a desktop computer) can be unlocked by the mere proximity of an authentication token (e.g., a smartphone). Given its appealing usability, ZIA has already been deployed in many real-world applications. However, ZIA contains one major security weakness - unauthorized physical access to the token, e.g., during lunch-time or upon theft, allows the attacker to have unfettered access to the terminal. In this paper, we address this gaping vulnerability with ZIA systems by (un)locking the authentication token with the user's walking pattern as she approaches the terminal to access it. Since a user's walking or gait pattern is believed to be unique, only that user (no imposter) would be able to unlock the token to gain access to the terminal in a ZIA session. While walking-based biometrics schemes have been studied in prior literature for other application settings, our main novelty lies in the careful use of: (1) multiple sensors available on the current breed of devices (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer), and (2) multiple devices carried by the user (in particular, an \"in-pocket\" smartphone and a \"wrist-worn\" smartwatch), that all capture unique facets of user's walking pattern. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we introduce, design and implement WUZIA (\"Walk-Unlock ZIA\"), a multi-modal walking biometrics approach tailored to enhance the security of ZIA systems (still with zero interaction). Second, we demonstrate that WUZIA offers a high degree of detection accuracy, based on multi-sensor and multi-device fusion. Third, we show that WUZIA can resist active attacks that attempt to mimic a user's walking pattern, especially when multiple devices are used.",

    "abstract": "Embedded sensing systems are pervasively used in life- and security-critical systems such as those found in airplanes, automobiles, and healthcare. Traditional security mechanisms for these sensors focus on data encryption and other post-processing techniques, but the sensors themselves often remain vulnerable to attacks in the physical/analog domain. If an adversary manipulates a physical/analog signal prior to digitization, no amount of digital security mechanisms after the fact can help. Fortunately, nature imposes fundamental constraints on how these analog signals can behave. This work presents PyCRA, a physical challenge-response authentication scheme designed to protect active sensing systems against physical attacks occurring in the analog domain. PyCRA provides security for active sensors by continually challenging the surrounding environment via random but deliberate physical probes. By analyzing the responses to these probes, and by using the fact that the adversary cannot change the underlying laws of physics, we provide an authentication mechanism that not only detects malicious attacks but provides resilience against them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PyCRA through several case studies using two sensing systems: (1) magnetic sensors like those found wheel speed sensors in robotics and automotive, and (2) commercial RFID tags used in many security-critical applications. Finally, we outline methods and theoretical proofs for further enhancing the resilience of PyCRA to active attacks by means of a confusion phase---a period of low signal to noise ratio that makes it more difficult for an attacker to correctly identify and respond to PyCRA's physical challenges. In doing so, we evaluate both the robustness and the limitations of PyCRA, concluding by outlining practical considerations as well as further applications for the proposed authentication mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in healthcare industry with new technology and population growth has given rise to security threat to our most personal data. The healthcare data management system consists of records in different formats such as text, numeric, pictures and videos leading to data which is big and unstructured. Also, hospitals have several branches at different locations throughout a country and overseas. In view of these requirements a cloud based healthcare management system can be an effective solution for efficient health care data management. One of the major concerns of a cloud based healthcare system is the security aspect. It includes theft to identity, tax fraudulence, insurance frauds, medical frauds and defamation of high profile patients. Hence, a secure data access and retrieval is needed in order to provide security of critical medical records in health care management system. Biometric authentication mechanism is suitable in this scenario since it overcomes the limitations of token theft and forgetting passwords in conventional token id-password mechanism used for providing security. It also has high accuracy rate for secure data access and retrieval. In this paper we propose BAMHealthCloud which is a cloud based system for management of healthcare data, it ensures security of data through biometric authentication. It has been developed after performing a detailed case study on healthcare sector in a developing country. Training of the signature samples for authentication purpose has been performed in parallel on hadoop MapReduce framework using Resilient Backpropagation neural network. From rigorous experiments it can be concluded that it achieves a speedup of 9x, Equal error rate (EER) of 0.12, sensitivity of 0.98 and specificity of 0.95 as compared to other approaches existing in literature.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing development of advanced communication technologies, vehicles are becoming smarter and more connected. Due to the tremendous growth of various vehicular applications, a huge amount of data is generated through advanced on-board devices and is deemed critical to improve driving safety and enhance vehicular services. However, cloud based models often fall short in applications where latency and mobility are critical. In order to fully realize the potential of vehicular networks, the challenges of efficient communication and computation need to be addressed. In this direction, vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged which extends the concept of fog computing to conventional vehicular networks. It is a geographically distributed paradigm that has the potential to conduct time-critical and data-intensive tasks by pushing intelligence (i.e. computing resources, storage, and application services) in the vicinity of end vehicles. However secure and reliable transmission are of significant importance in highly-mobile vehicular networks in order to ensure the optimal Quality of Service (QoS). In this direction, several authentication mechanisms have been proposed in the literature but most of them are found unfit due to absence of decentralization, anonymity, and trust characteristics. Thus, an effective cross-datacenter authentication and key-exchange scheme based on blockchain and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is proposed in this paper. Here, the distributed ledger of blockchain is used for maintaining the network information while the highly secure ECC is employed for mutual authentication between vehicles and road side units (RSUs). Additionally, the proposed scheme is lightweight and scalable for the considered VFC setup. The performance evaluation results against the existing state-of-the-art reveal that the proposed scheme accomplishes enhanced security features.",

The proposed solution effectively limits the number of mining nodes a single individual would be able to run while keeping membership open to everyone, circumventing the impossibility of full decentralization and the blockchain scalability trilemma when instantiated on a blockchain with a consensus protocol based on the cryptographic random selection of nodes. Resistance to collusion is also considered. Solving one of the most pressing problems in blockchains, a zk-PoI cryptocurrency is proved to have the following advantageous properties: - an incentive-compatible protocol for the issuing of cryptocurrency rewards based on a unique Nash equilibrium - strict domination of mining over all other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies, thus the zk-PoI cryptocurrency becoming the preferred choice by miners is proved to be a Nash equilibrium and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy - PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies are condemned to pay the Price of Crypto-Anarchy, redeemed by the optimal efficiency of zk-PoI as it implements the social optimum - the circulation of a zk-PoI cryptocurrency Pareto dominates other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies - the network effects arising from the social networks inherent to national identity cards and ePassports dominate PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies - the lower costs of its infrastructure imply the existence of a unique equilibrium where it dominates other forms of payment",

    "abstract": "RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a powerful technology that, due to its numerous advantages, is supposed to replace the various identification systems such as barcodes or magnetic stripes in a short time. There are three devices involved in an RFID protocol: a Reader, a Tag, and a back-end Database. One of the key factors for the RFID technology is that, in order to be used on large scale, the price of the Tags has to be cheap: it cannot be expensive because who is supposed to use it would need a great amount of them, furthermore, Tags must have very small dimensions. The low-cost nature of such devices implies the impossibility to use standard cryptographic protocols on them, furthermore, Ultra-Lightweight Tags even lack the necessary computational power to generate random numbers. Many experts are trying to build secure protocols that involve just simple bitwise logical operations for these Tags, but, unfortunately, each of these protocols turned out to be vulnerable to some serious attack after short time from publication. The need for a secure RFID authentication protocol today seems more urgent than ever, because this technology is already used for security purposes, such as electronic passports. The challenge to build a secure protocol for Ultra-Lightweight RFID systems is so hard that in several years no one has been able to build one. In this thesis we analyze in great detail a recently proposed protocol for Ultra-Lightweight RFID systems called SLAP, with the aim of finding new vulnerabilities. SLAP has already been violated (along with a set of similar protocols) by Safkhani and Bagheri, that have recently published a de-synchronization attack. At the end of our analysis, we will propose an impersonification attack to the protocol, along with a fix for our attack and some considerations on the attacks proposed on this kind of protocols.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the first-ever blockchain which can simultaneously handle device and data security, which is important for the emerging Internet-of-Everything (IoE). This article presents a unique concept of blockchain that integrates hardware security primitives called Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to solve scalability, latency, and energy requirement challenges and is called PUFchain. Data management and security (and privacy) of data, devices, and individuals, are some of the issues in the IoE architectures that need to be resolved. Integrating the blockchain into the IoE environment can help solve these issues and helps in the aspects of data storage and security. This article introduces a new blockchain architecture called PUFchain and introduces a new consensus algorithm called \"Proof of PUF-Enabled Authentication\" (PoP) for deployment in PUFchain. The proposed PoP is the PUF integration into our previously proposed Proof-of-Authentication (PoAh) consensus algorithm and can be called \"Hardware-Assisted Proof-of-Authentication (HA-PoAh)\". However, PUF integration is possible in the existing and new consensus algorithms. PoP utilizes PUFs which are responsible for generating a unique key that cannot be cloned and hence provide the highest level of security. A PUF uses the nanoelectronic manufacturing variations that are introduced during the fabrication of an integrated circuit to generate the keys. Hence, once generated from a PUF module, the keys cannot be cloned or generated from any other module. PUFchain uses a PUF and Hashing module which performs the necessary cryptographic functions. Hence the mining process is offloaded to the hardware module which reduces the processing times. PoP is approximately 1,000X faster than the well-established Proof-of-Work (PoW) and 5X faster than Proof-of-Authentication (PoAh).",

    "abstract": "The problem of secret-key based authentication under privacy and storage constraints on the source sequence is considered. The identifier measurement channels during authentication are assumed to be controllable via a cost-constrained action sequence. Single-letter inner and outer bounds for the key-leakage-storage-cost regions are derived for a generalization of a classic two-terminal key agreement model with an eavesdropper that observes a sequence that is correlated with the sequences observed by the legitimate terminals. The additions to the model are that the encoder observes a noisy version of a remote source, and the noisy output and the remote source output together with an action sequence are given as inputs to the measurement channel at the decoder. Thus, correlation is introduced between the noise components on the encoder and decoder measurements. The model with a secret key generated by an encoder is extended to the randomized models, where a secret-key is embedded to the encoder. The results are relevant for several user and device authentication scenarios including physical and biometric identifiers with multiple measurements that provide diversity and multiplexing gains. To illustrate the behavior of the rate region, achievable (secret-key rate, storage-rate, cost) tuples are given for binary identifiers and measurement channels that can be represented as a mixture of binary symmetric subchannels. The gains from using an action sequence such as a large secret-key rate at a significantly small hardware cost, are illustrated to motivate the use of low-complexity transform-coding algorithms with cost-constrained actions.",

The crucial goals of confidentiality and authentication may be achieved in various forms, each of different strength. Using soft (rather than crisp) constraints, we develop a uniform formal notion for the two goals. They are no longer formalised as mere yes/no properties as in the existing literature, but gain an extra parameter, the security level. For example, different messages can enjoy different levels of confidentiality, or a principal can achieve different levels of authentication with different principals. The goals are formalised within a general framework for protocol analysis that is amenable to mechanisation by model checking. Following the application of the framework to analysing the asymmetric Needham-Schroeder protocol, we have recently discovered a new attack on that protocol as a form of retaliation by principals who have been attacked previously. Having commented on that attack, we then demonstrate the framework on a bigger, largely deployed protocol consisting of three phases, Kerberos.",

A secure and efficient mechanism is provided to convey the information that is necessary for obtaining the original data at the receiver-end from its parts in the packets, that is, for solving the 'jigsaw puzzle'. The algorithm is designed to provide information-theoretic (that is, unconditional) security by the use of a one-time pad like scheme so that no intermediate or unintended node can obtain the entire data. An authentication code is also used to ensure authenticity of every packet.",

We show how we can achieve seamless L2 and L3 handoffs regardless of the authentication mechanism used and without any changes to either the infrastructure or the protocol. In particular, we provide a working implementation of CR and show how, with CR, MNs can achieve a total L2+L3 handoff time of less than 16 ms in an open network and of about 21 ms in an IEEE 802.11i network.

In this paper, we study constant dimension codes. It is shown that Steiner structures are optimal constant dimension codes achieving the Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound. Furthermore, we show that constant dimension codes achieve the Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound if and only if they are certain Steiner structures. Then, we derive two Johnson type upper bounds, say I and II, on constant dimension codes. The Johnson type bound II slightly improves on the Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound. Finally, we point out that a family of known Steiner structures is actually a family of optimal constant dimension codes achieving both the Johnson type bounds I and II.",

After discussing its limits, we define a new method based on the handling of the knowledge of protocol participants. This method is very general and is of natural use, as it consists in adding simple annotations, like for authentication problems. The method is very easy to implement in tools able to handle participants knowledge. We have implemented it in the AVISPA Tool and analyzed the optimistic Cederquist-Corin- Dashti protocol, discovering two unknown attacks.

This problem can, in more abstract terms, be phrased as an ephemeral key exchange problem: given a low bandwidth authentic (or private) communication channel between two nodes, and a high bandwidth broadcast channel, can we establish a high-entropy shared secret session key between the two nodes without relying on any a priori shared secret information.

The aim of this paper is to propose a model for XML data integrity considering XML data features. The paper presents an XML data integrity model named as CSR (content integrity, structure integrity, context referential integrity) based on a concatenated hash function. XML data content integrity is ensured using an iterative hash process, structure integrity is protected by hashing an absolute path string from root node, and context referential integrity is ensured by protecting context-related elements.

In this paper, we propose a MIMO-assisted channel-based authentication scheme, exploiting current channel estimation mechanisms in MIMO systems to detect spoofing attacks with very low overhead. In this scheme, the use of multiple antennas provides extra dimensions of channel estimation data, and thus leads to a \"security gain\" over single-input single-output (SISO) systems. We investigate the security gain of MIMO systems in several system configurations via simulations for a specific real indoor environment using ray-tracing software. We also discuss the effect of increasing the number of transmit and receive antennas on the security gain and contrast that to the diversity/multiplexing gain.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the relationships between the traditional Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol and the identity-based (ID-based) key agreement protocol from pairings. For the Sakai-Ohgishi-Kasahara (SOK) ID-based key construction, we show that identical to the Diffie-Hellman protocol, the SOK key agreement protocol also has three variants, namely \\emph{ephemeral}, \\emph{semi-static} and \\emph{static} versions. Upon this, we build solid relations between authenticated Diffie-Hellman (Auth-DH) protocols and ID-based authenticated key agreement (IB-AK) protocols, whereby we present two \\emph{substitution rules} for this two types of protocols. The rules enable a conversion between the two types of protocols. In particular, we obtain the \\emph{real} ID-based version of the well-known MQV (and HMQV) protocol. Similarly, for the Sakai-Kasahara (SK) key construction, we show that the key transport protocol underlining the SK ID-based encryption scheme (which we call the \"SK protocol\") has its non-ID counterpart, namely the Hughes protocol. Based on this observation, we establish relations between corresponding ID-based and non-ID-based protocols. In particular, we propose a highly enhanced version of the McCullagh-Barreto protocol.",

Second, it is spontaneous: safety messages can be authenticated locally, without support from the roadside units or contacting other vehicles. Third, it is efficient by offering fast message authentication and verification, cost-effective identity tracking in case of a dispute, and low storage requirements.

The pollution attacks are amplified by the network coding process, resulting in a greater damage than under traditional routing. In this paper, we address this issue by designing an unconditionally secure authentication code suitable for multicast network coding. The proposed scheme is robust against pollution attacks from outsiders, as well as coalitions of malicious insiders. Intermediate nodes can verify the integrity and origin of the packets received without having to decode, and thus detect and discard the malicious messages in-transit that fail the verification. This way, the pollution is canceled out before reaching the destinations. We analyze the performance of the scheme in terms of both multicast throughput and goodput, and show the goodput gains. We also discuss applications to file distribution.",

It uses trust values to favor packet forwarding by maintaining a trust counter for each node. A node is punished or rewarded by decreasing or increasing the trust counter. If the trust counter value falls below a trust threshold, the corresponding intermediate node is marked as malicious.

We demonstrate that the existing passive attacks on the HB protocol family, which have contributed to considerable reduction in its effective key-size, are ineffective against the NLHB protocol. From the evidence, we conclude that smaller-key sizes are sufficient for the NLHB protocol to achieve the same level of passive attack security as the HB Protocol. Further, for this choice of parameters, we provide an implementation instance for the NLHB protocol for which the Prover/Verifier complexity is lower than the HB protocol, enabling authentication on very low-cost devices like RFID tags. Finally, in the spirit of the HB$^{+}$ protocol, we extend the NLHB protocol to the NLHB$^{+}$ protocol and prove security against the class of active attacks defined in the DET Model.",

For the route discovery attacks in MANET routing protocols, our protocol gives an effective security. It supports the node to drop the invalid packets earlier by detecting the malicious nodes quickly by verifying the digital signatures of all the intermediate nodes. It punishes the misbehaving nodes by decrementing a credit counter and rewards the well behaving nodes by incrementing the credit counter. Thus it prevents uncompromised nodes from attacking the routes with malicious or compromised nodes. It is also used to prevent the denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Our results show that, at the highest security level of the protocol (security parameter= 256), inferring a nonce is feasible with the probability of 0.99 by eavesdropping(observing) about 90 runs of the protocol. Finding a nonce enable a passive attacker to recover all five secret keys of the protocol. To do so, we propose a three-phase probabilistic approach in this paper. Our attack recovers the secret keys with a probability that increases by accessing to more protocol runs. We also show that tracing a tag using this protocol is also possible even with less runs of the protocol.",

The continuous key update property of both schemes makes them capable of defending against all of the passive eavesdropping attacks and most of the currently-known active attacks against either Wi-Fi or RFID networks. However, each scheme is tailored to best suit the requirements of its respective paradigm. In Wi-Fi networks, we overlay, rather than completely replace, the current Wi-Fi security protocols. Thus, our Wi-Fi scheme can be readily implemented via only minor modifications over the IEEE 802.11 standards. On the other hand, the proposed RFID scheme introduces the first provably secure low cost RFID authentication protocol. The proposed schemes impose a throughput-security tradeoff that is shown, through our analytical and experimental results, to be practically acceptable.",

The encoded data includes the holder's name, date of birth, and other identifying information for the holder or the document. The VIZ contains the holder's photo and signature, usually on the data page. However, the MRZ and VIZ can be easily duplicated with normal document reproduction technology to produce a fake passport which can pass traditional verification. Neither of these features actively verify the holder's identity; nor do they bind the holder's identity to the document. A passport also contains pages for stamps of visas and of country entry and exit dates, which can be easily altered to produce fake permissions and travel records.

    "abstract": "Routing is the main part of wireless adhoc network conventionally there are two approaches first one is Proactive and another one is Reactive. Both these approaches have some substantial disadvantage and to overcome hybrid routing protocols designed. ZRP (Zone Routing Protocol) is one of the hybrid routing protocols, it takes advantage of proactive approach by providing reliability within the scalable zone, and for beyond the scalable zone it looks for the reactive approach. It (ZRP) uses the proactive and the reactive routing according to the need of the application at that particular instance of time depending upon the prevailing scenario. This work revolves around the performance of ZRP against realistic parameters by varying various attributes such as Zone Radius of ZRP in different node density. Results vary as we change the node density on Qualnet 4.0 network simulator.",

Dictionary attacks may be of two kinds: online and offline. While offline dictionary attacks are possible only if the adversary is able to collect data for a successful protocol execution by eavesdropping on the communication channel and can be successfully countered using public key cryptography, online dictionary attacks can be performed by anyone and there is no satisfactory solution to counter them. This paper presents a new authentication protocol which is called CompChall (computational challenge). The proposed protocol uses only one way hash functions as the building blocks and attempts to eliminate online dictionary attacks by implementing a challenge-response system. This challenge-response system is designed in a fashion that it does not pose any difficulty to a genuine user but is time consuming and computationally intensive for an adversary trying to launch a large number of login requests per unit time as in the case of an online dictionary attack. The protocol is stateless and thus less vulnerable to DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.",

The paper hinges on the paradigm of multipath routing and exploits the properties of polynomials. The first step in the algorithm is to transform the data such that it is impossible to obtain any information without possessing the entire transformed data. The algorithm then uses an intuitively simple idea of a jigsaw puzzle to break the transformed data into multiple packets where these packets form the pieces of the puzzle. Then these packets are sent along disjoint paths to reach the receiver. A secure and efficient mechanism is provided to convey the information that is necessary for obtaining the original data at the receiver-end from its fragments in the packets, that is, for solving the jigsaw puzzle. The algorithm is designed to be secure so that no intermediate or unintended node can obtain the entire data. An authentication code is also used to ensure authenticity of every packet.",

Even though the device can be borrowed by the other user temporarily, it is not safe for any user to borrow or lend the device as it may result the private data of the user to be public. To safeguard the user data and also to preserve user privacy we propose the technique of ownership authentication transfer. The user who is willing to sell the device has to transfer the ownership of the device under sale. Once the device is sold and the ownership has been transferred, the old owner will not be able to use that device at any cost. Either of the users will not be able to use the device if the process of ownership has not been carried out properly. This also takes care of the scenario when the device has been stolen or lost, avoiding the impersonation attack. The proposed protocol has been modeled and verified using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) and is found to be safe.",

This security breach is classified as an unauthorized use of Card, and it forms the bedrock for RFID Card compromise especially in access control. As an on-card authentication mechanism, this research proposed a concept termed Bio-Thentic Card, which can be adopted to prevent this single point of failure of RFID Card.

This offers some advantages in terms of security, as an eventual discovery of the key does not provide an obvious access to the features. Crucial for an efficient implementation are the computational complexity and the choice of good code parameters. The parameters depend on the particular application, e.g. the biometric feature to be stored and the rate one wants to allow for false acceptance.

Quantum information, with its well-known property of no-cloning, would, at first glance, prevent the basic copying attack for classical programs. We show that this intuition is false: one-time programs for both classical and quantum maps, based solely on quantum information, do not exist, even with computational assumptions. We complement this strong impossibility proof by an equally strong possibility result: assuming the same basic one-time memories as used for classical one-time programs, we show that every quantum map has a quantum one-time program that is secure in the universal composability framework.

In fact, Web services are a solution for the integration of distributed information systems, autonomous, heterogeneous and self-adaptable to the context. However, as Web services can evolve in a dynamic environment in a well-defined context and according to events automatically, such as time, temperature, location, authentication, etc.. We are interested in improving their SOA to empower the Web services to be self adaptive contexts. In this paper, we propose a new trend of self adaptability of Web services context. Then applying these requirements in the architecture of the platform of adaptability to context WComp, by integrating the workflow. Our work is illustrated by a case study of authentication.",

    "abstract": "As the use of biometrics becomes more wide-spread, the privacy concerns that stem from the use of biometrics are becoming more apparent. As the usage of mobile devices grows, so does the desire to implement biometric identification into such devices. A large majority of mobile devices being used are mobile phones. While work is being done to implement different types of biometrics into mobile phones, such as photo based biometrics, voice is a more natural choice. The idea of voice as a biometric identifier has been around a long time. One of the major concerns with using voice as an identifier is the instability of voice. We have developed a protocol that addresses those instabilities and preserves privacy. This paper describes a novel protocol that allows a user to authenticate using voice on a mobile/remote device without compromising their privacy. We first discuss the \\vv protocol, which has recently been introduced in research literature, and then describe its limitations. We then introduce a novel adaptation and extension of the vaulted verification protocol to voice, dubbed $V^3$. Following that we show a performance evaluation and then conclude with a discussion of security and future work.",

Since the cloud is a mere collection of tangible super computers spread across the world, authentication and authorization for data access is more than a necessity.

    "abstract": "Everyone is concerned about the Internet security, yet most traffic is not cryptographically protected. The usual justification is that most attackers are only off-path and cannot intercept traffic; hence, challenge-response mechanisms suffice to ensure authenticity. Usually, the challenges re-use existing `unpredictable' header fields to protect widely-deployed protocols such as TCP and DNS. We argue that this practice may often only give an illusion of security. We present recent off-path TCP injection and DNS poisoning attacks, enabling attackers to circumvent existing challenge-response defenses. Both TCP and DNS attacks are non-trivial, yet very efficient and practical. The attacks foil widely deployed security mechanisms, such as the Same Origin Policy, and allow a wide range of exploits, e.g., long-term caching of malicious objects and scripts. We hope that this article will motivate adoption of cryptographic mechanisms such as SSL/TLS, IPsec and DNSSEC, and of correct, secure challenge-response mechanisms.",

However, because existing key distribution methods cannot be fully trusted enough for automatic use, key management has remained a user problem. We propose a fundamentally new approach to the key distribution problem by empowering end-users with the capacity to independently verify the authenticity of public keys using an additional media attestment. This permits client software to automatically lookup public keys from a keyserver without trusting the keyserver, because any attempted MITM attacks can be detected by end-users. Thus, our protocol is designed to enable a new breed of messaging clients with true end-to-end encryption built in, without the hassle of requiring users to manually manage the public keys, that is verifiably secure against MITM attacks, and does not require trusting any third parties.",

First, we analyze the state of the art, in particular the protective scheme VeRA and present two new rank order attacks as well as extensions to mitigate them. Second, we derive and evaluate TRAIL, a generic scheme for topology authentication in RPL. TRAIL solely relies on the basic assumptions of RPL that (1) the root node serves as a trust anchor and (2) each node interconnects to the root as part of a hierarchy. Using proper reachability tests, TRAIL scalably and reliably identifies any topological attacker without strong cryptographic efforts.",

In a 5x5 grid of access points, within a 6x6 grid of regions, by location tracking and data mining, we predict the mobility pattern of mobile node with good accuracy. The pre-scanning of mobile nodes, along with pre-authenticating neighbouring access points and pre-reassociation is used to reduce the scan delay, authentication delay and re-association delay respectively. The model implements first stage reservation by using prediction results and does second stage reservation based on the packet content type, so that sufficient resources can be reserved when the mobile node does the handoff to the next access point. The overall mobility management scheme thus reduces the handoff delay. The performance simulations are done to verify the proposed model.",

The groped blocks break the block-wise independence and therefore can withstand the Vector Quantization attack(VQ attack). The inserting positions are related to the statistical information of image block data, in order to increase the security and provide an auxiliary way to authenticate the image data.

At Google, we have created a first-of-its-kind dataset of human movements, passively collected by 1500 volunteers using their smartphones daily over several months. We (1) compare several neural architectures for efficient learning of temporal multi-modal data representations, (2) propose an optimized shift-invariant dense convolutional mechanism (DCWRNN), and (3) incorporate the discriminatively-trained dynamic features in a probabilistic generative framework taking into account temporal characteristics. Our results demonstrate that human kinematics convey important information about user identity and can serve as a valuable component of multi-modal authentication systems.",

    "abstract": "In sensor networks, nodes cooperatively work to collect data and forward it to the final destination. Many protocols have been proposed in the literature to provide routing and secure routing for ad hoc and sensor networks, but these protocols either very expensive to be used in very resource-limited environments such as sensor networks, or suffer from the lack of one or more security guarantees and vulnerable to attacks such as wormhole, Sinkhole, Sybil, blackhole, selective forwarding, rushing, and fabricating attacks. In this paper we propose a secure lightweight routing protocol called SRPS. SRPS uses symmetric cryptographic entities within the capabilities of the sensors, supports intermediate node authentication of the routing information in addition to end-to-end authentication, provides secure multiple disjoint paths, and thwarts all the known attacks against routing infrastructure against Byzantine cooperative attack model. We analyze the security guarantees of SRPS and use Ns-2 simulations to show the effectiveness of SRPS in counter-measuring known attacks against the routing infrastructure. Overhead cost analysis is conducted to prove the lightweight-ness of SRPS",

In this paper we describe a range of attacks on this protocol that include very efficient and practical tag impersonation as well as partial, and total, tag secret key recovery. Most of these results have been practically verified, they contrast with the 80-bit security that is claimed for the protocol, and they emphasize the importance of independent public review for any cryptographic proposal.",

ZKP is used to confirm the identify of the sensor nodes, with small computational requirement, which is favorable for body sensors given their limited resources, while the commitment scheme is used to deal with replay attacks and hence the injection attacks by committing a message and revealing the key later.

In the context of the biometric authentication, this means that more intruders will be classified as valid user, and in case of speaker identification system, user A will be classified user B. In this paper, we examine poisoning attack against SVM and introduce - Curie - a method to protect the SVM classifier from the poisoning attack. The basic idea of our method is to identify the poisoned data points injected by the adversary and filter them out. Our method is light weight and can be easily integrated into existing systems. Experimental results show that it works very well in filtering out the poisoned data.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of cheap computing through five decades of continued miniaturization following Moores Law, wearable devices are becoming increasingly popular. These wearable devices are typically interconnected using wireless body area network (WBAN). Human body communication (HBC) provides an alternate energy-efficient communication technique between on-body wearable devices by using the human body as a conducting medium. This allows order of magnitude lower communication power, compared to WBAN, due to lower loss and broadband signaling. Moreover, HBC is significantly more secure than WBAN, as the information is contained within the human body and cannot be snooped on unless the person is physically touched. In this paper, we highlight applications of HBC as (1) Social Networking (e.g. LinkedIn/Facebook friend request sent during Handshaking in a meeting/party), (2) Secure Authentication using human-human or human-machine dynamic HBC and (3) ultra-low power, secure BAN using intra-human HBC. One of the biggest technical bottlenecks of HBC has been the interference (e.g. FM) picked up by the human body acting like an antenna. In this work, for the first time, we introduce an integrating dual data rate (DDR) receiver technique, that allows notch filtering (>20 dB) of the interference for interference-robust HBC.",

Proposals have been published to tackle this problem in 5G based on pseudonyms, and different public-key technologies. This paper looks into the problem of concealing long-term identity of a subscriber and presents a technique based on identity based encryption (IBE) to tackle it. The proposed solution can be extended to a mutual authentication and key agreement protocol between a serving network (SN) and a user equipment (UE). This mutual authentication and key agreement protocol does not need to connect with the home network (HN) on every run. A qualitative comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of different techniques show that our solution is competitive for securing the long-term identity privacy of a user in the 5G network.",

In this work, we explore users' acceptance of location information and how it affects decision-making for security and privacy. We conducted a series of qualitative interviews to learn how location can be integrated into users' decision-making for security, and we designed a security indicator to alert the user to changes in website locations. We evaluated our tool in a 44-participant user study and found that users were less likely to perform security-sensitive tasks when alerted to location changes. Our results suggest that website location can be used as an effective indicator for users' security assessments.",

    "abstract": "Today's Internet utilizes a multitude of different protocols. While some of these protocols were first implemented and used and later documented, other were first specified and then implemented. Regardless of how protocols came to be, their definitions can contain traps that lead to insecure implementations or deployments. A classical example is insufficiently strict authentication requirements in a protocol specification. The resulting Misconfigurations, i.e., not enabling strong authentication, are common root causes for Internet security incidents. Indeed, Internet protocols have been commonly designed without security in mind which leads to a multitude of misconfiguration traps. While this is slowly changing, to strict security considerations can have a similarly bad effect. Due to complex implementations and insufficient documentation, security features may remain unused, leaving deployments vulnerable. In this paper we provide a systematization of the security traps found in common Internet protocols. By separating protocols in four classes we identify major factors that lead to common security traps. These insights together with observations about end-user centric usability and security by default are then used to derive recommendations for improving existing and designing new protocols---without such security sensitive traps for operators, implementors and users.",

On the one hand, we can improve the usability of existing cognitive schemes by significantly reducing the number of challenge-response rounds by (partially) relying on the hardness of mimicking carefully designed behavioural biometric gestures. On the other hand, the observation resistant property of cognitive schemes provides an extra layer of protection for behavioural biometrics; an attacker is unsure if a failed impersonation is due to a biometric failure or a wrong response to the challenge. We design and develop an instantiation of such a \"hybrid\" scheme, and call it BehavioCog. To provide security close to a 4-digit PIN---one in 10,000 chance to impersonate---we only need two challenge-response rounds, which can be completed in less than 38 seconds on average (as estimated in our user study), with the advantage that unlike PINs or passwords, the scheme is secure under observation.",

    "abstract": "Recent literature suggests that the Internet of Things (IoT) scales much better in an Information-Centric Networking (ICN) model instead of the current host-centric Internet Protocol (IP) model. In particular, the Named Data Networking (NDN) project (one of the ICN architecture flavors) offers features exploitable by IoT applications, such as stateful forwarding, in- network caching, and built-in assurance of data provenance. Though NDN-based IoT frameworks have been proposed, none have adequately and holistically addressed concerns related to secure onboarding and routing. Additionally, emerging IoT applications such as smart cities require high scalability and thus pose new challenges to NDN routing. Therefore, in this work, we propose and evaluate a novel, scalable framework for lightweight authentication and hierarchical routing in the NDN IoT (ND- NoT). Our ns-3 based simulation analyses demonstrate that our framework is scalable and efficient. It supports deployment densities as high as 40,000 nodes/km2 with an average onboarding convergence time of around 250 seconds and overhead of less than 20 KiB per node. This demonstrates its efficacy for emerging large-scale IoT applications such as smart cities.",

The celebrated PBFT state machine replication protocol tolerates $f$ Byzantine faults in an asynchronous setting using $3f+1$ replicas, and has since been studied or deployed by numerous works. In this work, we improve the Byzantine fault tolerance threshold to $n=2f+1$ by utilizing a relaxed synchrony assumption. We present a synchronous state machine replication protocol that commits a decision every 3 rounds in the common case. The key challenge is to ensure quorum intersection at one honest replica. Our solution is to rely on the synchrony assumption to form a post-commit quorum of size $2f+1$, which intersects at $f+1$ replicas with any pre-commit quorums of size $f+1$. Our protocol also solves synchronous authenticated Byzantine agreement in expected 8 rounds. The best previous solution (Katz and Koo, 2006) requires expected 24 rounds. Our protocols may be applied to build Byzantine fault tolerant systems or improve cryptographic protocols such as cryptocurrencies when synchrony can be assumed.",

If the channel is authenticated the task can be solved in a single round of communication using a strong randomness extractor; choosing a quantum-proof extractor allows one to establish security against quantum adversaries. In the case that the channel is not authenticated, Dodis and Wichs (STOC'09) showed that the problem can be solved in two rounds of communication using a non-malleable extractor, a stronger pseudo-random construction than a strong extractor. We give the first construction of a non-malleable extractor that is secure against quantum adversaries. The extractor is based on a construction by Li (FOCS'12), and is able to extract from source of min-entropy rates larger than $1/2$. Combining this construction with a quantum-proof variant of the reduction of Dodis and Wichs, shown by Cohen and Vidick (unpublished), we obtain the first privacy amplification protocol secure against active quantum adversaries.",

Existing tools and techniques do not allow to verify directly these properties, expressed as behavioral equivalences. We propose a different approach: we design two conditions on protocols which are sufficient to ensure anonymity and unlinkability, and which can then be effectively checked automatically using ProVerif. Our two conditions correspond to two broad classes of attacks on unlinkability, i.e. data and control-flow leaks. This theoretical result is general enough that it applies to a wide class of protocols based on a variety of cryptographic primitives. In particular, using our tool, UKano, we provide the first formal security proofs of protocols such as BAC and PACE (e-passport), Hash-Lock (RFID authentication), etc. Our work has also lead to the discovery of new attacks, including one on the LAK protocol (RFID authentication) which was previously claimed to be unlinkable (in a weak sense).",

The performance of these classifiers was evaluated on four distinct behavioral biometric datasets, and compared with eight multi-class classifiers (MCC). The results demonstrate that if we have sufficient training data from the genuine user the OCC, and their fusion can closely match the performance of the majority of MCC.

We also evaluate the performance of both the object password schemes against conventional text-based password schemes using prototypes of each of the frameworks.

The scheme uses only bitwise XOR and mod operation for the computational work. Also, the scheme does not use any pseudo-number generator on the tag-side. We use two benchmark metric based on anonymity set to measure the privacy level of the system when some tags are compromised by an adversary. We present some simulation results which show that the scheme preserves high level of privacy and discloses very less amount of information when some tags are compromised.

Given the increasing number of compromised user credential stores, we make the assumption that criminals already know the user credentials. Hence, to test our solution, users were given authentic user credentials and asked to login to our proof-of-concept. Despite the fact that all illegitimate users in our test cases were given the correct user credentials for legitimate users, none of these were granted access by the system. This demonstrates zero- tolerance to false positives. The results demonstrate the uniqueness of keystroke dynamics and its use to prevent users with stolen credentials from accessing systems they are not authorized to access.",

    "abstract": "The concept of truth, as a public good is the production of a collective understanding, which emerges from a complex network of social interactions. The recent impact of social networks on shaping the perception of truth in political arena shows how such perception is corroborated and established by the online users, collectively. However, investigative journalism for discovering truth is a costly option, given the vast spectrum of online information. In some cases, both journalist and online users choose not to investigate the authenticity of the news they receive, because they assume other actors of the network had carried the cost of validation. Therefore, the new phenomenon of \"fake news\" has emerged within the context of social networks. The online social networks, similarly to System of Systems, cause emergent properties, which makes authentication processes difficult, given availability of multiple sources. In this study, we show how this conflict can be modeled as a volunteer's dilemma. We also show how the public contribution through news subscription (shared rewards) can impact the dominance of truth over fake news in the network.",

Moreover, the authentication process itself may be a weak point. To study authentication weaknesses at scale, automated login capabilities are needed. In this work we introduce Shepherd, a scanning framework to automatically log in on websites. The Shepherd framework enables us to perform large-scale scans of post-login aspects of websites. Shepherd scans a website for login fields, attempts to submit credentials and evaluates whether login was successful. We illustrate Shepherd's capabilities by means of a scan for session hijacking susceptibility. In this study, we use a set of unverified website credentials, some of which will be invalid. Using this set, Shepherd is able to fully automatically log in and verify that it is indeed logged in on 6,273 unknown sites, or 12.4% of the test set. We found that from our (biased) test set, 2,579 sites, i.e., 41.4%, are vulnerable to simple session hijacking attacks.",

Recent advances have facilitated the communication between backscatter tags and on-body smart devices. These studies have focused on the communication dimension, while the security dimension remains vulnerable. It has been demonstrated that wireless connectivity can be exploited to send unauthorized commands or fake messages that result in device malfunctioning. The key challenge in defending these attacks stems from the minimalist design in backscatter. Thus, in this paper, we explore the feasibility of authenticating an on-body backscatter tag without modifying its signal or protocol. We present SecureScatter, a physical-layer solution that delegates the security of backscatter to an on-body smart device. To this end, we profile the on-body propagation paths of backscatter links, and construct highly sensitive propagation signatures to identify on-body backscatter links. We implement our design in a software radio and evaluate it with different backscatter tags that work at 2.4 GHz and 900 MHz. Results show that our system can identify on-body devices at 93.23% average true positive rate and 3.18% average false positive rate.",

Here, we use multi-task learning to differentiate samples by both fonts and characters and compare the resulting classifier with its analogue trained for binary font classification. We train neural networks for authenticity estimation of the fonts used in machine-readable zones and ID numbers of the Russian national passport and test them on samples of individual characters acquired from 3238 images of the Russian national passport. Our results show that the usage of multi-task learning increases sensitivity and specificity of the classifier. Moreover, the resulting CNNs demonstrate high generalization ability as they correctly classify fonts which were not present in the training set. We conclude that the proposed method is sufficient for authentication of the fonts and can be used as a part of the forgery detection system for images acquired with a smartphone camera.",

The cooperation of the Internet and vehicular cloud can make the communication more efficient in IoV. In this paper, we mainly focus on the secure communication between vehicles and roadside units.

With big sensing data, IoT provides lots of convenient services for the monitoring and management of smart cities and people's daily lives. However, there are still many security challenges influencing the further development of IoT, one of which is how to quickly verify the big data obtained from IoT terminals. Aggregate signature is an efficient approach to perform big data authentication. It can effectively reduce the computation and communication overheads. In this paper, utilizing these features, we construct a verifiable data aggregation scheme for Internet of Things, named VDAS, based on an improved certificateless aggregate signature algorithm. In VDAS, the length of the aggregated authentication message is independent of the number of IoT terminals. Then, we prove that VDAS is existentially unforgeable under adaptive chosen message attacks assuming that the computational Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Additionally, the proposed VDAS achieves a better trade-off on the computation overheads between the resource-constrained IoT terminals and the data center.",

Reference bits are derived from the scrambled MSB bits of a cover image, and then are combined with authentication bits to form the watermark bits for LSB embedding. We find this algorithm has a feature of block independence of embedding watermark such that it is vulnerable to a collage attack. In addition, because the generation of authentication bits via hash function operations is not related to secret keys, we analyze this algorithm by a multiple stego-image attack. We find that the cost of obtaining all the permutation relations of $l\\cdot b^2$ watermark bits of each block (i.e., equivalent permutation keys) is about $(l\\cdot b^2)!$ for the embedding mode $(m, l)$, where $m$ MSB layers of a cover image are used for generating reference bits and $l$ LSB layers for embedding watermark, and $b\\times b$ is the size of image block. The simulation results and the statistical results demonstrate our analysis is effective.",

Existing CNN-based approaches usually well recognize the spoofing faces when training and testing spoofing samples display similar patterns, but their performance would drop drastically on testing spoofing faces of unseen scenes. In this paper, we try to boost the generalizability and applicability of these methods by designing a CNN model with two major novelties. First, we propose a simple yet effective Total Pairwise Confusion (TPC) loss for CNN training, which enhances the generalizability of the learned Presentation Attack (PA) representations. Secondly, we incorporate a Fast Domain Adaptation (FDA) component into the CNN model to alleviate negative effects brought by domain changes. Besides, our proposed model, which is named Generalizable Face Authentication CNN (GFA-CNN), works in a multi-task manner, performing face anti-spoofing and face recognition simultaneously. Experimental results show that GFA-CNN outperforms previous face anti-spoofing approaches and also well preserves the identity information of input face images.",

Furthermore, by calculations and experiments, the daily channel capacity to leak data of the channel is obtained. Although the storage capacity of a single RFID card is very small, a large user base can still bring about a considerable amount to leak data. Then, the reasons for the existence of such channels are discussed. To eliminate this type of covert channels, a new authentication protocol between RFID cards and card readers are proposed.

For example, the attacker cannot break memory isolation, or the attacker has no knowledge of a secret key or random values. This paper presents a novel, lightweight mechanism protecting return addresses, Zipper Stack, which authenticates all return addresses by a chain structure using cryptographic message authentication codes (MACs). This innovative design can defend against the most powerful attackers who have full control over the program's memory and even know the secret key of the MAC function. This threat model is stronger than the one used in related work. At the same time, it produces low-performance overhead. We implemented Zipper Stack by extending the RISC-V instruction set architecture, and the evaluation on FPGA shows that the performance overhead of Zipper Stack is only 1.86%. Thus, we think Zipper Stack is suitable for actual deployment.",

Personal services are vanilla HTTP services that are invoked from a browser, upon a request made by a service Provider, to deliver some service on the client side, i.e., on an execution environment defined by the browser's user. Personal services can be used both to handle content manipulation and presentation or to deliver request-response interactions with different goals (e.g. user authentication). Unlike plugins, that are described to service providers on each and every HTTP request, personal services are explicitly searched by service providers using a novel agent, a Broker, that works in close cooperation with each browser. We have implemented this architecture and implemented an HTTP proxy to cope with it. For demonstration purposes we show how we can use personal services for personal authentication with an electronic identification (eID) card",

    "abstract": "Email breaches are commonplace, and they expose a wealth of personal, business, and political data that may have devastating consequences. The current email system allows any attacker who gains access to your email to prove the authenticity of the stolen messages to third parties -- a property arising from a necessary anti-spam / anti-spoofing protocol called DKIM. This exacerbates the problem of email breaches by greatly increasing the potential for attackers to damage the users' reputation, blackmail them, or sell the stolen information to third parties. In this paper, we introduce \"non-attributable email\", which guarantees that a wide class of adversaries are unable to convince any third party of the authenticity of stolen emails. We formally define non-attributability, and present two practical system proposals -- KeyForge and TimeForge -- that provably achieve non-attributability while maintaining the important protection against spam and spoofing that is currently provided by DKIM. Moreover, we implement KeyForge and demonstrate that that scheme is practical, achieving competitive verification and signing speed while also requiring 42% less bandwidth per email than RSA2048.",

    "abstract": "Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) are widely used as authentication method for systems such as Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and Point of Sale (PoS). Input devices (PIN pads) usually give the user a feedback sound when a key is pressed. In this paper, we propose an attack based on the extraction of inter-keystroke timing from the feedback sound when users type their PINs. Our attack is able to reach an accuracy of 98% with a mean error of 0.13 +/-6.66 milliseconds. We demonstrate that inter-keystroke timing significantly improves the guessing probability of certain subsets of PINs. We believe this represents a security problem that has to be taken into account for secure PIN generation. Furthermore, we identified several attack scenarios where the adversary can exploit inter-keystroke timing and additional information about the user or the PIN, such as typing behavior. Our results show that combining the inter-keystroke timing with other information drastically reduces attempts to guess a PIN, outperforming random guessing. With our attack, we are able to guess 72% of the 4-digit PINs within 3 attempts. We believe this poses a serious security problem for systems that use PIN-based authentication.",

    "abstract": "The central building block of secure and privacy-preserving Vehicular Communication (VC) systems is a Vehicular Public-Key Infrastructure (VPKI), which provides vehicles with multiple anonymized credentials, termed pseudonyms. These pseudonyms are used to ensure message authenticity and integrity while preserving vehicle (thus passenger) privacy. In the light of emerging large-scale multi-domain VC environments, the efficiency of the VPKI and, more broadly, its scalability are paramount. By the same token, preventing misuse of the credentials, in particular, Sybil-based misbehavior, and managing \"honest-but-curious\" insiders are other facets of a challenging problem. In this paper, we leverage a state-of-the-art VPKI system and enhance its functionality towards a highly-available, dynamically-scalable, and resilient design; this ensures that the system remains operational in the presence of benign failures or resource depletion attacks, and that it dynamically scales out, or possibly scales in, according to request arrival rates. Our full-blown implementation on the Google Cloud Platform shows that deploying large-scale and efficient VPKI can be cost-effective.",

In order to enhance security and privacy on the Internet, many security protocols have been developed. Unfortunately, the security analyzes that have been carried out on these protocols show that they are vulnerable to one or few attacks, which eliminates the use of these protocols. Therefore, the need for a security protocol on the Internet of Things (IoT) has not yet been resolved. Recently, Khor and Sidorov cryptanalyzed the Wang et al. protocol and presented an improved version of it. In this paper, at first, we show that this protocol also does not have sufficient security and so it is not recommended to be used in any application. More precisely, we present a full secret disclosure attack against this protocol, which extracted the whole secrets of the protocol by two communication with the target tag. In addition, Sidorv et al. recently proposed an ultralightweight mutual authentication RFID protocol for blockchain enabled supply chains, supported by formal and informal security proofs. However, we present a full secret disclosure attack against this protocol as well.",

While some users acknowledge the security benefits of MFA, majority of them still faced problems with initial configuration, system design understanding, limited device compatibility, and risk trade-offs leading to non-adoption of MFA.

However, the existence of inaccurate information within the network can cause traffic aberrations and also disrupt the normal functioning of any traffic monitoring system. Thus, determining the credibility of broadcast messages originating from the region of interest (ROI) is crucial under a malicious environment. Additionally, a breach of privacy involving a vehicle's private information, such as location and velocity, can lead to severe consequences like unauthorized tracking and masquerading attack. Thus, we propose an edge cloud based privacy-preserving secured decision making model that employs a heuristic based on vehicular data such as GPS location and velocity to authenticate traffic-related information from the ROI under different traffic scenarios such as congestion. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been validated using VENTOS, SUMO, and Omnet++ simulators, and also by using a simulated cloud environment. We compare our proposed model to the existing peer-based authentication model, the majority voting model, and the reputation-based system under different attack scenarios. We show that our model is capable of filtering malicious vehicles effectively and provide accurate traffic information under the presence of at least one non-malicious vehicle within the ROI.",

In this paper, we propose a novel Private DNS-over-TLS (PDoT ) architecture. PDoT includes a DNS Recursive Resolver (RecRes) that operates within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Using Remote Attestation, DNS clients can authenticate, and receive strong assurance of trustworthiness of PDoT RecRes.

Accordingly, we want to explore the use of artificially-generated sentences along with data-selection algorithms to improve German-to-English NMT models trained solely with authentic data.

WAGE is based on the Welch-Gong stream cipher and provides authenticated encryption. WAGE has 259 bits of state, two 7 bit Welch-Gong permutations, and four lightweight 7 bit S-boxes. ACE and WAGE have the same external interface and follow the same I/O protocol to transition between phases.

The paper reports area, power, and energy results for both serial and parallel (unrolled) implementations using four different ASIC libraries: two 65 nm libraries, a 90 nm library, and a 130 nm library. ACE implementations range from a throughput of 0.5 bits-per-clock cycle (bpc) and an area of 4210 GE (averaged across the four ASIC libraries) up to 4 bpc and 7260 GE.

As originally proposed, these schemes were claimed to be resistant against reversibility, authentication, and linkability attacks under the stolen token scenario. We propose several attacks against GRP-IoM and URP-IoM, and argue that both schemes are severely vulnerable against authentication and linkability attacks.

We conducted two surveys, one recruiting gamers and one recruiting from a general population. In addition, we conducted three focus group interviews to evaluate various incentive designs for both, the gaming context and the non-gaming context. We found that visual modifications, which are the most popular type of gaming-related incentives, are not as popular in non-gaming contexts.

    "abstract": "Smartphones and tablets have become ubiquitous in our daily lives. Smartphones, in particular, have become more than personal assistants. These devices have provided new avenues for consumers to play, work, and socialize whenever and wherever they want. Smartphones are small in size, so they are easy to handle and to stow and carry in users' pockets or purses. However, mobile devices are also susceptible to various problems. One of the greatest concerns is the possibility of breach in security and privacy if the device is seized by an outside party. It is possible that threats can come from friends as well as strangers. Due to the size of smart devices, they can be easily lost and may expose details of users' private lives. In addition, this might enable pervasive observation or imitation of one's movements and activities, such as sending messages to contacts, accessing private communication, shopping with a credit card, and relaying information about where one has been. This paper highlights the potential risks that occur when smartphones are stolen or seized, discusses the concept of continuous authentication, and analyzes current approaches and mechanisms of behavioral biometrics with respect to methodology, associated datasets and evaluation approaches.",

The novel approach of learning the mapping instead of the boundaries further avoids the problem encountered in typical classifiers for which the learnt boundaries may be complex and difficult to analyze. RegNet achieves high performance in terms of security metrics such as Equal Error Rate (EER), False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR).

To respond to automobile theft, data mining, biometrics, and additional authentication methods are proposed. Among current countermeasures, data mining method is one of the efficient ways to capture the owner driver's unique characteristics. To identify the owner driver from thieves, previous works applied various algorithms toward driving data. Such data mining methods utilized supervised learning, thus required labeled data set. However, it is unrealistic to gather and apply the thief's driving pattern. To overcome this problem, we propose driver identification method with GAN. GAN has merit to build identification model by learning the owner driver's data only. We trained GAN only with owner driver's data and used trained discriminator to identify the owner driver. From actual driving data, we evaluated our identification model recognizes the owner driver well. By ensembling various driver authentication methods with the proposed model, we expect industry can develop automobile theft countermeasures available in the real world.",

The adversary need not break crypto, nor compromise any upper-layer security protocols for mounting this attack. No known solution currently exists to protect against distance enlargement.

Existing infrastructure makes Wi-Fi a possible candidate, yet, utilizing traditional signal processing methods to extract information necessary to fully characterize an event by sensing weak ambient Wi-Fi signals is deemed to be challenging. This paper introduces a novel end to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously predicts the identity, activity and the location of a user to create user profiles similar to the information provided through a video camera. The system is fully autonomous and requires zero user intervention unlike systems that require user-initiated initialization, or a user held transmitting device to facilitate the prediction. The system can also predict the trajectory of the user by predicting the location of a user over consecutive time steps. The performance of the system is evaluated through experiments.",

In this work, we present a new multimodal biometric dataset (face, voice, and periocular) acquired using a smartphone. The new dataset is comprised of 150 subjects that are captured in six different sessions reflecting real-life scenarios of smartphone assisted authentication. One of the unique features of this dataset is that it is collected in four different geographic locations representing a diverse population and ethnicity. Additionally, we also present a multimodal Presentation Attack (PA) or spoofing dataset using a low-cost Presentation Attack Instrument (PAI) such as print and electronic display attacks. The novel acquisition protocols and the diversity of the data subjects collected from different geographic locations will allow developing a novel algorithm for either unimodal or multimodal biometrics. Further, we also report the performance evaluation of the baseline biometric verification and Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) on the newly collected dataset.",

    "abstract": "Using smartphones for peer-to-peer communication over the Internet is difficult without the aid of centralized services. These centralized services, which usually reside in the cloud, are necessary for brokering communication between peers, and all communication must pass through them. A reason for this is that smartphones lack publicly reachable IP addresses. Also, because people carry their smartphones with them, smartphones will often disconnect from one network and connect to another. Smartphones can also go offline. Additionally, a network of trusted peers (or friends) requires a directory of known peers, authentication mechanisms, and secure communication channels. In this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer middleware that provides these features without the need for centralized services.",

Most methods generate perturbations like normal noise, which is not interpretable and without semantic meaning. In this paper, we propose High-Resolution Feature-based Attack (HRFA), yielding authentic adversarial examples with up to $1024 \\times 1024$ resolution. HRFA exerts attack by modifying the latent feature representation of the image, i.e., the gradients back propagate not only through the victim DNN, but also through the generative model that maps the feature space to the image space. In this way, HRFA generates adversarial examples that are in high-resolution, realistic, noise-free, and hence is able to evade several denoising-based defenses. In the experiment, the effectiveness of HRFA is validated by attacking the object classification and face verification tasks with BigGAN and StyleGAN, respectively. The advantages of HRFA are verified from the high quality, high authenticity, and high attack success rate faced with defenses.",

This manipulation is performed by man-in-the-middle malware that covertly rearranges the linguistic content of an authentic social media post and comments. We call this attack Malware-Induced Misperception (MIM) because the goal is to socially engineer spiral-of-silence conditions on social media by inducing perception. We conducted experimental tests in controlled settings (N = 311) where a malware covertly altered selected words in a Facebook post about the freedom of political expression on college campuses. The empirical results (1) confirm the previous findings about the presence of the spiral-of-silence effect on social media; and (2) demonstrate that inducing misperception is an effective tactic to silence or provoke targeted users on Facebook to express their opinion on a polarizing political issue.",

Selected authorities may recover the identity of allegedly misbehaving users, and users can prove properties about their identity without revealing it in the clear. EL PASSO does not require specific secure hardware or a third party (other than existing participants in SSO). The generation and use of authentication credentials are asynchronous, allowing users to sign on when identity providers are temporarily unavailable. We evaluate EL PASSO in a distributed environment and prove its low computational cost, yielding faster sign-on operations than OIDC from a regular laptop, one-second user-perceived latency from a low-power device, and scaling to more than 50 sign-on operations per second at a relying party using a single 4-core server in the cloud.",

    "abstract": "Emerging non-volatile main memory (NVMM) is rapidly being integrated into computer systems. However, NVMM is vulnerable to potential data remanence and replay attacks. Established security models including split counter mode encryption and Bonsai Merkle tree (BMT) authentication have been introduced against such data integrity attacks. However, these security methods are not readily compatible with NVMM. Recent works on secure NVMM pointed out the need for data and its metadata, including the counter, the message authentication code (MAC), and the BMT to be persisted atomically. However, memory persistency models have been overlooked for secure NVMM, which is essential for crash recoverability. In this work, we analyze the invariants that need to be ensured in order to support crash recovery for secure NVMM. We highlight that prior research has substantially under-estimated the cost of BMT persistence and propose several optimization techniques to reduce the overhead of atomically persisting updates to BMTs. The optimizations proposed explore the use of pipelining, out-of-order writes, and update coalescing while conforming to strict or epoch persistency models respectively. We evaluate our work and show that our proposed optimizations significantly reduce the performance overhead of secure NVMM with crash recoverability.",

However, the accurate acquisition of the depth profile is an expensive and challenging process. Here, we introduce a novel method that learns to recognize faces from stereo camera systems without the need to explicitly compute the facial surface or depth map. The raw face stereo images along with the location in the image from which the face is extracted allow the proposed CNN to improve the recognition task while avoiding the need to explicitly handle the geometric structure of the face. This way, we keep the simplicity and cost efficiency of identity authentication from a single image, while enjoying the benefits of geometric data without explicitly reconstructing it. We demonstrate that the suggested method outperforms both existing single-image and explicit depth based methods on large-scale benchmarks, and even capable of recognize spoofing attacks. We also provide an ablation study that shows that the suggested method uses the face locations in the left and right images to encode informative features that improve the overall performance.",

More precisely, we show that using a simple strategyan adversary may indeed obtain non-negligible information on the shared identification secret. While the security of a quantum identity authentication scheme is not formally defined in [1], it is clear that such a definition should somehow imply that an external entity may gain no information on the shared identification scheme (even if he actively participates injecting messages in a protocol execution, which is not assumed in our attack strategy).",

We collect a dataset of PPG measurements from a set of 15 users over the course of 6-11 sessions per user using an iPhone X for the measurements. We design an authentication pipeline that leverages the uniqueness of each individual's cardiovascular system, identifying a set of distinctive features from each heartbeat. We conduct a set of experiments to evaluate the recognition performance of the PPG biometric trait, including cross-session scenarios which have been disregarded in previous work.

Furthermore, we propose a verifiable credential powered decentralized Public Key Infrastructure using distributed ledger technologies, which creates a straightforward and verifiable way for retrieving digital certificates.",

    "abstract": "Facial cosmetics have the ability to substantially alter the facial appearance, which can negatively affect the decisions of a face recognition. In addition, it was recently shown that the application of makeup can be abused to launch so-called makeup presentation attacks. In such attacks, the attacker might apply heavy makeup in order to achieve the facial appearance of a target subject for the purpose of impersonation. In this work, we assess the vulnerability of a COTS face recognition system to makeup presentation attacks employing the publicly available Makeup Induced Face Spoofing (MIFS) database. It is shown that makeup presentation attacks might seriously impact the security of the face recognition system. Further, we propose an attack detection scheme which distinguishes makeup presentation attacks from genuine authentication attempts by analysing differences in deep face representations obtained from potential makeup presentation attacks and corresponding target face images. The proposed detection system employs a machine learning-based classifier, which is trained with synthetically generated makeup presentation attacks utilizing a generative adversarial network for facial makeup transfer in conjunction with image warping. Experimental evaluations conducted using the MIFS database reveal a detection equal error rate of 0.7% for the task of separating genuine authentication attempts from makeup presentation attacks.",

To this end, we utilize pressure data collected from textile-based sensor arrays integrated onto a mattress to estimate the BMI values of subjects and classify their identities in different positions by using a deep multitask neural network. First, we filter and extract 14 features from the data and subsequently employ deep neural networks for BMI estimation and subject identification on two different public datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed solution outperforms prior works and several machine learning benchmarks by a considerable margin, while also estimating users' BMI in a 10-fold cross-validation scheme.",

    "abstract": "Conditional image generation is the task of generating diverse images using class label information. Although many conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown realistic results, such methods consider pairwise relations between the embedding of an image and the embedding of the corresponding label (data-to-class relations) as the conditioning losses. In this paper, we propose ContraGAN that considers relations between multiple image embeddings in the same batch (data-to-data relations) as well as the data-to-class relations by using a conditional contrastive loss. The discriminator of ContraGAN discriminates the authenticity of given samples and minimizes a contrastive objective to learn the relations between training images. Simultaneously, the generator tries to generate realistic images that deceive the authenticity and have a low contrastive loss. The experimental results show that ContraGAN outperforms state-of-the-art-models by 7.3% and 7.7% on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet datasets, respectively. Besides, we experimentally demonstrate that ContraGAN helps to relieve the overfitting of the discriminator. For a fair comparison, we re-implement twelve state-of-the-art GANs using the PyTorch library. The software package is available at https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/PyTorch-StudioGAN.",

    "abstract": "In multimedia forensics, learning-based methods provide state-of-the-art performance in determining origin and authenticity of images and videos. However, most existing methods are challenged by out-of-distribution data, i.e., with characteristics that are not covered in the training set. This makes it difficult to know when to trust a model, particularly for practitioners with limited technical background. In this work, we make a first step toward redesigning forensic algorithms with a strong focus on reliability. To this end, we propose to use Bayesian neural networks (BNN), which combine the power of deep neural networks with the rigorous probabilistic formulation of a Bayesian framework. Instead of providing a point estimate like standard neural networks, BNNs provide distributions that express both the estimate and also an uncertainty range. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework on a classical forensic task: resampling detection. The BNN yields state-of-the-art detection performance, plus excellent capabilities for detecting out-of-distribution samples. This is demonstrated for three pathologic issues in resampling detection, namely unseen resampling factors, unseen JPEG compression, and unseen resampling algorithms. We hope that this proposal spurs further research toward reliability in multimedia forensics.",

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel architecture that integrates remote attestation and backdoor inspection.

Next, we introduce post-quantum digital schemes, which are being developed with the specific intent of mitigating against threats from quantum algorithms whilst still relying on digital processes and infrastructure. Finally, we review schemes for signing information carried on quantum channels, which promise provable security metrics.

We formalize the problem as searching for the attribute set that satisfies a security requirement and minimizes the usability cost. The security is measured as the proportion of impersonated users given a fingerprinting probe, a user population, and an attacker that knows the exact fingerprint distribution among the user population. The usability is quantified by the collection time of browser fingerprints, their size, and their instability. We compare our framework with common baselines, based on a real-life fingerprint dataset, and find out that in our experimental settings, our framework selects attribute sets of lower usability cost. Compared to the baselines, the attribute sets found by FPSelect generate fingerprints that are up to 97 times smaller, are collected up to 3,361 times faster, and with up to 7.2 times less changing attributes between two observations, on average.",

The naturalness of the synthesized speech was comparable to that of the human speech, but the synthesized speech entertained listeners less than the performers of any rank. However, we obtained some interesting insights into challenges to be solved in order to achieve a truly entertaining rakugo synthesizer. For example, naturalness was not the most important factor, even though it has generally been emphasized as the most important point to be evaluated in the conventional speech synthesis field. More important factors were the understandability of the content and distinguishability of the characters in the rakugo story, both of which the synthesized rakugo speech was relatively inferior at as compared with the professional performers. We also found that fundamental frequency fo modeling should be further improved to better entertain audiences. These results show important steps to reaching authentically entertaining speech synthesis.",

At the cyber layer, the proposed solution is based on the MULTOS Trust-Anchor chip, using an authenticated encryption protocol, offering cryptographically protected and chained reports at up to 12/s. The availability of the trust-anchors, allows the grid controller to delegate aspects of passive anomaly detection, supporting local as well as central alarms. In this context, a distributed event-triggered MTD protocol is implemented at the physical layer to complement cyber side enhancement. This protocol applies a distributed anomaly detection scheme based on Holt-Winters seasonal forecasting in combination with MTD implemented via inductance perturbation. The scheme is shown to be effective at preventing or detecting a wide range of attacks against power system measurement system.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has enabled remarkable progress in model compression and knowledge transfer. However, KD requires a large volume of original data or their representation statistics that are not usually available in practice. Data-free KD has recently been proposed to resolve this problem, wherein teacher and student models are fed by a synthetic sample generator trained from the teacher. Nonetheless, existing data-free KD methods rely on fine-tuning of weights to balance multiple losses, and ignore the diversity of generated samples, resulting in limited accuracy and robustness. To overcome this challenge, we propose robustness and diversity seeking data-free KD (RDSKD) in this paper. The generator loss function is crafted to produce samples with high authenticity, class diversity, and inter-sample diversity. Without real data, the objectives of seeking high sample authenticity and class diversity often conflict with each other, causing frequent loss fluctuations. We mitigate this by exponentially penalizing loss increments. With MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets, our experiments show that RDSKD achieves higher accuracy with more robustness over different hyperparameter settings, compared to other data-free KD methods such as DAFL, MSKD, ZSKD, and DeepInversion.",

    "abstract": "Searching accounts for one of the most frequently performed computations over the Internet as well as one of the most important applications of outsourced computing, producing results that critically affect users' decision-making behaviors. As such, verifying the integrity of Internet-based searches over vast amounts of web contents is essential. We provide the first solution to this general security problem. We introduce the concept of an authenticated web crawler and present the design and prototype implementation of this new concept. An authenticated web crawler is a trusted program that computes a special \"signature\" $s$ of a collection of web contents it visits. Subject to this signature, web searches can be verified to be correct with respect to the integrity of their produced results. This signature also allows the verification of complicated queries on web pages, such as conjunctive keyword searches. In our solution, along with the web pages that satisfy any given search query, the search engine also returns a cryptographic proof. This proof, together with the signature $s$, enables any user to efficiently verify that no legitimate web pages are omitted from the result computed by the search engine, and that no pages that are non-conforming with the query are included in the result. An important property of our solution is that the proof size and the verification time both depend solely on the sizes of the query description and the query result, but not on the number or sizes of the web pages over which the search is performed. Our authentication protocols are based on standard Merkle trees and the more involved bilinear-map accumulators. As we experimentally demonstrate, the prototype implementation of our system gives a low communication overhead between the search engine and the user, and allows for fast verification of the returned results on the user side.",

    "abstract": "An interesting challenge for the cryptography community is to design authentication protocols that are so simple that a human can execute them without relying on a fully trusted computer. We propose several candidate authentication protocols for a setting in which the human user can only receive assistance from a semi-trusted computer --- a computer that stores information and performs computations correctly but does not provide confidentiality. Our schemes use a semi-trusted computer to store and display public challenges $C_i\\in[n]^k$. The human user memorizes a random secret mapping $\\sigma:[n]\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}_d$ and authenticates by computing responses $f(\\sigma(C_i))$ to a sequence of public challenges where $f:\\mathbb{Z}_d^k\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}_d$ is a function that is easy for the human to evaluate. We prove that any statistical adversary needs to sample $m=\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{s(f)})$ challenge-response pairs to recover $\\sigma$, for a security parameter $s(f)$ that depends on two key properties of $f$. To obtain our results, we apply the general hypercontractivity theorem to lower bound the statistical dimension of the distribution over challenge-response pairs induced by $f$ and $\\sigma$. Our lower bounds apply to arbitrary functions $f $ (not just to functions that are easy for a human to evaluate), and generalize recent results of Feldman et al. As an application, we propose a family of human computable password functions $f_{k_1,k_2}$ in which the user needs to perform $2k_1+2k_2+1$ primitive operations (e.g., adding two digits or remembering $\\sigma(i)$), and we show that $s(f) = \\min\\{k_1+1, (k_2+1)/2\\}$. For these schemes, we prove that forging passwords is equivalent to recovering the secret mapping. Thus, our human computable password schemes can maintain strong security guarantees even after an adversary has observed the user login to many different accounts.",

    "abstract": "BrowserID is a complex, real-world Single Sign-On (SSO) System for web applications recently developed by Mozilla. It employs new HTML5 features (such as web messaging and web storage) and cryptographic assertions to provide decentralized login, with the intent to respect users' privacy. It can operate in a primary and a secondary identity provider mode. While in the primary mode BrowserID runs with arbitrary identity providers (IdPs), in the secondary mode there is one IdP only, namely Mozilla's default IdP. We recently proposed an expressive general model for the web infrastructure and, based on this web model, analyzed the security of the secondary IdP mode of BrowserID. The analysis revealed several severe vulnerabilities. In this paper, we complement our prior work by analyzing the even more complex primary IdP mode of BrowserID. We do not only study authentication properties as before, but also privacy properties. During our analysis we discovered new and practical attacks that do not apply to the secondary mode: an identity injection attack, which violates a central authentication property of SSO systems, and attacks that break an important privacy promise of BrowserID and which do not seem to be fixable without a major redesign of the system. Some of our attacks on privacy make use of a browser side channel that has not gained a lot of attention so far. For the authentication bug, we propose a fix and formally prove in a slight extension of our general web model that the fixed system satisfies all the requirements we consider. This constitutes the most complex formal analysis of a web application based on an expressive model of the web infrastructure so far. As another contribution, we identify and prove important security properties of generic web features in the extended web model to facilitate future analysis efforts of web standards and web applications.",

    "abstract": "In the last several decades, the automotive industry has come to incorporate the latest Information and Communications (ICT) technology, increasingly replacing mechanical components of vehicles with electronic components. These electronic control units (ECUs) communicate with each other in an in-vehicle network that makes the vehicle both safer and easier to drive. Controller Area Networks (CANs) are the current standard for such high quality in-vehicle communication. Unfortunately, however, CANs do not currently offer protection against security attacks. In particular, they do not allow for message authentication and hence are open to attacks that replay ECU messages for malicious purposes. Applying the classic cryptographic method of message authentication code (MAC) is not feasible since the CAN data frame is not long enough to include a sufficiently long MAC to provide effective authentication. In this paper, we propose a novel identification method, which works in the physical layer of an in-vehicle CAN network. Our method identifies ECUs using inimitable characteristics of signals enabling detection of a compromised or alien ECU being used in a replay attack. Unlike previous attempts to address security issues in the in-vehicle CAN network, our method works by simply adding a monitoring unit to the existing network, making it deployable in current systems and compliant with required CAN standards. Our experimental results show that the bit string and classification algorithm that we utilized yielded more accurate identification of compromised ECUs than any other method proposed to date. The false positive rate is more than 2 times lower than the method proposed by P.-S. Murvay et al. This paper is also the first to identify potential attack models that systems should be able to detect.",

    "abstract": "The lack of stability is one of the major limitations that constrains PUF from being put in widespread practical use. In this paper, we propose a weak PUF and a strong PUF that are both completely stable with 0% intra-distance. These PUFs are called Locally Enhanced Defectivity (LED)PUF. The source of randomness of a LEDPUF is extracted from locally enhance defectivity without affecting other parts of the chip. A LEDPUF is a pure functional PUF that does not require any kinds of correction schemes as conventional parametric PUFs do. A weak LEDPUF is constructed by forming arrays of Directed Self Assembly (DSA) random connections is presented, and the strong LEDPUF is implemented by using the weak LEDPUF as the key of a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). Our simulation and statistical results show that the entropy of the weak LEDPUF bits is close to ideal, and the inter-distances of both weak and strong LEDPUFs are about 50%, which means that these LEDPUFs are not only stable but also unique. We develop a new unified framework for evaluating the level of security of PUFs, based on password security, by using information theoretic tools of guesswork. The guesswork model allows to quantitatively compare, with a single unified metric, PUFs with varying levels of stability, bias and available side information. In addition, it generalizes other measures to evaluate the security level such as min-entropy and mutual information. We evaluate guesswork-based security of some measured SRAM and Ring Oscillator PUFs as an example and compare them with LEDPUF to show that stability has a more severe impact on the PUF security than biased responses. Furthermore, we find the guesswork of three new problems: Guesswork under probability of attack failure, the guesswork of idealized version of a message authentication code, and the guesswork of strong PUFs that are used for authentication.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring is indispensable to check status, activities, or resource usage of IT services. A combination of Kibana and Elasticsearch is used for monitoring in many places such as KEK, CC-IN2P3, CERN, and also non-HEP communities. Kibana provides a web interface for rich visualization, and Elasticsearch is a scalable distributed search engine. However, these tools do not support authentication and authorization features by default. In the case of single Kibana and Elasticsearch services shared among many users, any user who can access Kibana can retrieve other's information from Elasticsearch. In multi-user environment, in order to protect own data from others or share part of data among a group, fine-grained access control is necessary. The CERN cloud service group had provided cloud utilization dashboard to each user by Elasticsearch and Kibana. They had deployed a homemade Elasticsearch plugin to restrict data access based on a user authenticated by the CERN Single Sign On system. It enabled each user to have a separated Kibana dashboard for cloud usage, and the user could not access to other's one. Based on the solution, we propose an alternative one which enables user/group based Elasticsearch access control and Kibana objects separation. It is more flexible and can be applied to not only the cloud service but also the other various situations. We confirmed our solution works fine in CC-IN2P3. Moreover, a pre-production platform for CC-IN2P3 has been under construction. We will describe our solution for the secure use of Kibana and Elasticsearch including integration of Kerberos authentication, development of a Kibana plugin which allows Kibana objects to be separated based on user/group, and contribution to Search Guard which is an Elasticsearch plugin enabling user/group based access control. We will also describe the effect on performance from using Search Guard.",

    "abstract": "Some of the main challenges towards utilizing conventional cryptographic techniques in Internet of Things (IoT) include the need for generating secret keys for such a large-scale network, distributing the generated keys to all the devices, key storage as well as the vulnerability to security attacks when an adversary gets physical access to the devices. In this paper, a novel secret key generation method is proposed for IoTs that utilize the intrinsic randomness embedded in the devices' memories introduced in the manufacturing process. A fuzzy extractor structure using serially concatenated BCH-Polar codes is proposed to generate reproducible keys from a ReRAM-based \\emph{ternary-state} Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for device authentication and secret key generation. The ReRAM based PUFs are the most practical choice for authentication and key generation in IoT, as they operate at or below the systems' noise level and therefore are less vulnerable to side channel attacks compared to the alternative memory technologies. However, the current ReRAM-based PUFs present a high false negative authentication rate since the behavior of these devices can vary in different physical conditions that results in a low probability of regenerating the same response in different attempts. In this paper, we propose a secret key generation scheme for ternary state PUFs that enables reliable reconstruction of the desired secret keys utilizing a serially concatenated BCH-Polar fuzzy extractor. The experimental results show that the proposed model can offer a significantly lower probability of mismatch between the original key and the regenerated ones, while a less number of \\textit{Helper data} bits were used to extract the \\textit{Key} when compared to previously proposed fuzzy extractor techniques.",

    "abstract": "Using communication services is a common part of everyday life in a personal or business context. Communication services include Internet services like voice services, chat service, and web 2.0 technologies (wikis, blogs, etc), but other usage areas like home energy management and eMobility are will be increasingly tackled. Such communication services typically authenticate participants. For this identities of some kind are used to identify the communication peer to the user of a service or to the service itself. Calling line identification used in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) used for Voice over IP (VoIP) is just one example. Authentication and identification of eCar users for accounting during charging of the eCar is another example. Also, further mechanisms rely on identities, e.g., whitelists defining allowed communication peers. Trusted identities prevent identity spoofing, hence are a basic building block for the protection of communication. However, providing trusted identities in a practical way is still a difficult problem and too often application specific identities are used, making identity handling a hassle. Nowadays, many countries introduced electronic identity cards, e.g., the German \"Elektronischer Personalausweis\" (ePA). As many German citizens will possess an ePA soon, it can be used as security token to provide trusted identities. Especially new usage areas (like eMobility) should from the start be based on the ubiquitous availability of trusted identities. This paper describes how identity cards can be integrated within three domains: home energy management, vehicle-2-grid communication, and SIP-based voice over IP telephony. In all three domains, identity cards are used to reliably identify users and authenticate participants. As an example for an electronic identity card, this paper focuses on the German ePA.",

    "abstract": "With an exponential increase in number of users switching to mobile banking, various countries are adopting biometric solutions as security measures. The main reason for biometric technologies becoming more common in the everyday lives of consumers is because of the facility to easily capture biometric data in real time, using their mobile phones. Biometric technologies are providing the potential security framework to make banking more convenient and secure than it has ever been. At the same time, the exponential growth of enrollment in the biometric system produces massive amount of high dimensionality data that leads to degradation in the performance of the mobile banking systems. Therefore, in order to overcome the performance issues arising due to this data deluge, this paper aims to propose a distributed mobile biometric system based on a high performance cluster Cloud. High availability, better time efficiency and scalability are some of the added advantages of using the proposed system. In this paper a Cloud based mobile biometric authentication framework (BAMCloud) is proposed that uses dynamic signatures and performs authentication. It includes the steps involving data capture using any handheld mobile device, then storage, preprocessing and training the system in a distributed manner over Cloud. For this purpose we have implemented it using MapReduce on Hadoop platform and for training Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation neural network has been used. Moreover, the methodology adopted is very novel as it achieves a speedup of 8.5x and a performance of 96.23%. Furthermore, the cost benefit analysis of the implemented system shows that the cost of implementation and execution of the system is lesser than the existing ones. The experiments demonstrate that the better performance is achieved by proposed framework as compared to the other methods used in the recent literature.",

    "abstract": "Encrypting data before sending it to the cloud protects it against hackers and malicious insiders, but requires the cloud to compute on encrypted data. Trusted (hardware) modules, e.g., secure enclaves like Intel's SGX, can very efficiently run entire programs in encrypted memory. However, it already has been demonstrated that software vulnerabilities give an attacker ample opportunity to insert arbitrary code into the program. This code can then modify the data flow of the program and leak any secret in the program to an observer in the cloud via SGX side-channels. Since any larger program is rife with software vulnerabilities, it is not a good idea to outsource entire programs to an SGX enclave. A secure alternative with a small trusted code base would be fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) -- the holy grail of encrypted computation. However, due to its high computational complexity it is unlikely to be adopted in the near future. As a result researchers have made several proposals for transforming programs to perform encrypted computations on less powerful encryption schemes. Yet, current approaches fail on programs that make control-flow decisions based on encrypted data. In this paper, we introduce the concept of data flow authentication (DFAuth). DFAuth prevents an adversary from arbitrarily deviating from the data flow of a program. Hence, an attacker cannot perform an attack as outlined before on SGX. This enables that all programs, even those including operations on control-flow decision variables, can be computed on encrypted data. We implemented DFAuth using a novel authenticated homomorphic encryption scheme, a Java bytecode-to-bytecode compiler producing fully executable programs, and SGX enclaves. A transformed neural network that performs machine learning on sensitive medical data can be evaluated on encrypted inputs and encrypted weights in 0.86 seconds.",

    "abstract": "In this Thesis, several results in quantum information theory are collected, most of which use entropy as the main mathematical tool. *While a direct generalization of the Shannon entropy to density matrices, the von Neumann entropy behaves differently. A long-standing open question is, whether there are quantum analogues of unconstrained non-Shannon type inequalities. Here, a new constrained non-von-Neumann type inequality is proven, a step towards a conjectured unconstrained inequality by Linden and Winter. *IID quantum state merging can be optimally achieved using the decoupling technique. The one-shot results by Berta et al. and Anshu at al., however, had to bring in additional mathematical machinery. We introduce a natural generalized decoupling paradigm, catalytic decoupling, that can reproduce the aforementioned results when used analogously to the application of standard decoupling in the asymptotic case. *Port based teleportation, a variant of standard quantum teleportation protocol, cannot be implemented perfectly. We prove several lower bounds on the necessary number of output ports N to achieve port based teleportation for given error and input dimension, showing that N diverges uniformly in the dimension of the teleported quantum system, for vanishing error. As a byproduct, a new lower bound for the size of the program register for an approximate universal programmable quantum processor is derived. *In the last part, we give a new definition for information-theoretic quantum non-malleability, strengthening the previous definition by Ambainis et al. We show that quantum non-malleability implies secrecy, analogous to quantum authentication. Furthermore, non-malleable encryption schemes can be used as a primitive to build authenticating encryption schemes. We also show that the strong notion of authentication recently proposed by Garg et al. can be fulfilled using 2-designs.",

    "abstract": "Although the traditional physical password, fingerprint unlocking and facial features have improved the security to a certain extent, they have the characteristics of passive authentication and easiness to be stolen. The existing behavioral data collected based on mobile phone sensors is mainly used for human activity recognition and fall detection and health management. Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well. Based on the time series behavior data of mobile terminal users, this paper uses Prophet algorithm to decompose the time series of six kinds of daily behavior and strip off the singular value, to get the inherent cycle and trend of each behavior, and to verify the legitimacy of the behavior user at the next moment. The experimental results on the UniMiB SHAR public dataset show that the user only needs to do 2 cycles of specified actions to realize the prediction of the next time series. The main contribution of this paper is that we propose a new idea for smartphone user authentication. It is based on real-time data of smartphone user behavior, through Phophet algorithm for feature decomposition and time series prediction, and to find the inherent cycle and other characteristics, so as to perform user behavior recognition. This data-driven auxiliary authentication method can effectively solve the problem of easy forgery of static feature recognition such as password, fingerprint and face recognition.",

    "abstract": "Single-factor password-based authentication is generally the norm to access on-line Web-sites. While single-factor authentication is well known to be a weak form of authentication, a further concern arises when considering the possibility for an attacker to recover the user passwords by leveraging the loopholes in the password recovery mechanisms. Indeed, the adoption by a Web-site of a poor password management system makes useless even the most robust password chosen by the registered users. In this paper, building on the results of our previous work, we study the possible attacks to on-line password recovery systems analyzing the mechanisms implemented by some of the most popular Web-sites. In detail, we provide several contributions: (i) we revise and detail the attacker model; (ii) we provide an updated analysis with respect to a preliminary study we carried out in December 2017; (iii) we perform a brand new analysis of the current top 200 Alexa's Web-sites of five major EU countries; and, (iv) we propose \\sol, a working open-source module that could be adopted by any Web-site to provide registered users with a password recovery mechanism to prevent mail service provider-level attacks. Overall, it is striking to notice how the analyzed Web-sites have made little (if any) effort to become compliant with the GDPR regulation, showing that the objective to have basic user protection mechanisms in place---despite the fines threatened by GDPR---is still far, mainly because of sub-standard security management practices. Finally, it is worth noting that while this study has been focused on EU registered Web-sites, the proposed solution has, instead, general applicability.",

    "abstract": "In the Lattice Agreement (LA) problem, originally proposed by Attiya et al. \\cite{Attiya:1995}, a set of processes has to decide on a chain of a lattice. More precisely, each correct process proposes an element $e$ of a certain join-semi lattice $L$ and it has to decide on a value that contains $e$. Moreover, any pair $p_i,p_j$ of correct processes has to decide two values $dec_i$ and $dec_j$ that are comparable (e.g., $dec_i \\leq dec_j$ or $dec_j < dec_i$). LA has been studied for its practical applications, as example it can be used to implement a snapshot objects \\cite{Attiya:1995} or a replicated state machine with commutative operations \\cite{Faleiro:2012}. Interestingly, the study of the Byzantine Lattice Agreement started only recently, and it has been mainly devoted to asynchronous systems. The synchronous case has been object of a recent pre-print \\cite{Zheng:aa} where Zheng et al. propose an algorithm terminating in ${\\cal O}(\\sqrt f)$ rounds and tolerating $f < \\lceil n/3 \\rceil$ Byzantine processes. In this paper we present new contributions for the synchronous case. We investigate the problem in the usual message passing model for a system of $n$ processes with distinct unique IDs. We first prove that, when only authenticated channels are available, the problem cannot be solved if $f=n/3$ or more processes are Byzantine. We then propose a novel algorithm that works in a synchronous system model with signatures (i.e., the {\\em authenticated message} model), tolerates up to $f$ byzantine failures (where $f<n/3$) and that terminates in ${\\cal O}(\\log f)$ rounds. We discuss how to remove authenticated messages at the price of algorithm resiliency ($f < n/4$). Finally, we present a transformer that converts any synchronous LA algorithm to an algorithm for synchronous Generalised Lattice Agreement.",

    "abstract": "Advances in graphics and machine learning have led to the general availability of easy-to-use tools for modifying and synthesizing media. The proliferation of these tools threatens to cast doubt on the veracity of all media. One approach to thwarting the flow of fake media is to detect modified or synthesized media through machine learning methods. While detection may help in the short term, we believe that it is destined to fail as the quality of fake media generation continues to improve. Soon, neither humans nor algorithms will be able to reliably distinguish fake versus real content. Thus, pipelines for assuring the source and integrity of media will be required---and increasingly relied upon. We propose AMP, a system that ensures the authentication of media via certifying provenance. AMP creates one or more publisher-signed manifests for a media instance uploaded by a content provider. These manifests are stored in a database allowing fast lookup from applications such as browsers.

    "title": "How not to secure wireless sensor networks: A plethora of insecure polynomial-based key pre-distribution schemes",
    "author": [
      "Chris J Mitchell"
    ],
    "abstract": "Three closely-related polynomial-based group key pre-distribution schemes have recently been proposed, aimed specifically at wireless sensor networks. The schemes enable any subset of a predefined set of sensor nodes to establish a shared secret key without any communications overhead. It is claimed that these schemes are both secure and lightweight, i.e. making them particularly appropriate for network scenarios where nodes have limited computational and storage capabilities. Further papers have built on these schemes, e.g. to propose secure routing protocols for wireless sensor networks. Unfortunately, as we show in this paper, all three schemes are completely insecure; whilst the details of their operation varies, they share common weaknesses. In every case we show that an attacker equipped with the information built into at most two sensor nodes can compute group keys for all possible groups of which the attacked nodes are not a member, which breaks a fundamental design objective. The attacks can also be achieved by an attacker armed with the information from a single node together with a single group key to which this sensor node is not entitled. Repairing the schemes appears difficult, if not impossible. The existence of major flaws is not surprising given the complete absence of any rigorous proofs of security for the proposed schemes. A further recent paper proposes a group membership authentication and key establishment scheme based on one of the three key pre-distribution schemes analysed here; as we demonstrate, this scheme is also insecure, as the attack we describe on the corresponding pre-distribution scheme enables the authentication process to be compromised.",

    "abstract": "In modern embedded systems, the trust in comprehensive security standards all along the product life cycle has become an increasingly important access-to-market requirement. However, these security standards rely on mandatory immunity assumptions such as the integrity and authenticity of an initial system configuration typically loaded from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM). This applies especially to FPGA-based Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC) architectures, since object codes as well as configuration data easily exceed the capacity of a secure bootROM. In this context, an attacker could try to alter the content of the NVM device in order to manipulate the system. The PSoC therefore relies on the integrity of the NVM particularly at boot-time. In this paper, we propose a methodology for securely booting from an NVM in a potentially unsecure environment by exploiting the reconfigurable logic of the FPGA. Here, the FPGA serves as a secure anchor point by performing required integrity and authenticity verifications prior to the configuration and execution of any user application loaded from the NVM on the PSoC. The proposed secure boot process is based on the following assumptions and steps: 1) The boot configurationis stored on a fully encrypted Secure Digital memory card (SD card) or alternatively Flash acting as NVM. 2) At boot time, a hardware design called Trusted Memory-Interface Unit (TMIU) is loaded to verify first the authenticity of the deployed NVM and then after decryption the integrity of its content. To demonstrate the practicability of our approach, we integrated the methodology into the vendor-specific secure boot process of a Xilinx Zynq PSoC and evaluated the design objectives performance, power and resource costs.",

    "abstract": "Observation Resilient Authentication Schemes (ORAS) are a class of shared secret challenge-response identification schemes where a user mentally computes the response via a cognitive function to authenticate herself such that eavesdroppers cannot readily extract the secret. Security evaluation of ORAS generally involves quantifying information leaked via observed challenge-response pairs. However, little work has evaluated information leaked via human behavior while interacting with these schemes. A common way to achieve observation resilience is by including a modulus operation in the cognitive function. This minimizes the information leaked about the secret due to the many-to-one map from the set of possible secrets to a given response. In this work, we show that user behavior can be used as a side-channel to obtain the secret in such ORAS. Specifically, the user's eye-movement patterns and associated timing information can deduce whether a modulus operation was performed (a fundamental design element), to leak information about the secret. We further show that the secret can still be retrieved if the deduction is erroneous, a more likely case in practice. We treat the vulnerability analytically, and propose a generic attack algorithm that iteratively obtains the secret despite the \"faulty\" modulus information. We demonstrate the attack on five ORAS, and show that the secret can be retrieved with considerably less challenge-response pairs than non-side-channel attacks (e.g., algebraic/statistical attacks). In particular, our attack is applicable on Mod10, a one-time-pad based scheme, for which no non-side-channel attack exists. We field test our attack with a small-scale eye-tracking user study.",

Results show OAuth emerging as the authentication and authorization protocol, giving support to three types of APIs, client-side or Javascript, server-side or representational state transfer (REST) and streaming. JSON is the most popular format, but there a considerable variety of resource types and a lack of representation standard, which makes harder for the third-party developer integrating with several services.",

    "abstract": "We propose a learning method with feature selection for Locality-Sensitive Hashing. Locality-Sensitive Hashing converts feature vectors into bit arrays. These bit arrays can be used to perform similarity searches and personal authentication. The proposed method uses bit arrays longer than those used in the end for similarity and other searches and by learning selects the bits that will be used. We demonstrated this method can effectively perform optimization for cases such as fingerprint images with a large number of labels and extremely few data that share the same labels, as well as verifying that it is also effective for natural images, handwritten digits, and speech features.",

A dictionary attack is a method of breaking the password by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password. This attack leads to an overload on the server leading to denial of service attack. This paper presents a protocol to reduce the rate of dictionary attack by using a prover and a verifier system. This system makes it difficult for the attacker to prove it as a valid user by becoming computationally intensive. The rate of attempts is also reduced and thus restricting the Denial of Service attack.",

We experimentally show that these methods are far from ideal with respect to expected covering of the PIN space and the entropy of PINs.

These examples establish the usefulness of the proposed methodology.",

The OTPs are more predictable than expected. A forgery attack is described. We argue the attack success probability is $8^{-5}$. That is much higher than $10^{-6}$ which may be expected if all the digits are independent and uniformly distributed. Under natural assumptions even in a relatively small bank or company with $10^4$ customers the number of compromised accounts during a year may be more than $100$.",

When a client needs to disconnect from the wireless access point, it sends special frames known as deauthentication or disassociation frames. Due to being encrypted, these frames do not require an authenticated user. Hence, an attacker can craft these frames and send them to the access point in such a way that the access point assumes the frames to be coming from the client and not the attacker. In this paper, an efficient solution is proposed to prevent deauthentication attack by using a session management system used to then verify deauthentication frames.",

Provided that users of these platforms consent to employing captured eye movement signals for authentication and health assessment, it becomes important to estimate oculomotor plant and brain function characteristics in real time. This paper shows a path toward that goal by presenting a parallel processing architecture capable of estimating oculomotor plant characteristics and comparing its performance to a single-threaded implementation. Results show that the parallel implementation improves the speed, accuracy, and throughput of oculomotor plant characteristic estimation versus the original serial version for both large-scale and real-time simulation.",

For usage purposes, a SIARD archive can be reloaded into any current or future RDBMS which supports standard SQL.

In an effort to reduce the setup assumptions required for efficient zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge that remain secure against concurrent man-in-the-middle attacks, we consider a model, which we call the Authenticated Public-Key (APK) model. The APK model seems to significantly reduce the setup assumptions made by the CRS model (as no trusted party or honest execution of a centralized algorithm are required), and can be seen as a slightly stronger variation of the Bare Public-Key (BPK) model from \\cite{CGGM,MR}, and a weaker variation of the registered public-key model used in \\cite{BCNP}. We then define and study man-in-the-middle attacks in the APK model. Our main result is a constant-round concurrent non-malleable zero-knowledge argument of knowledge for any polynomial-time relation (associated to a language in $\\mathcal{NP}$), under the (minimal) assumption of the existence of a one-way function family. Furthermore,We show time-efficient instantiations of our protocol based on known number-theoretic assumptions. We also note a negative result with respect to further reducing the setup assumptions of our protocol to those in the (unauthenticated) BPK model, by showing that concurrently non-malleable zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge in the BPK model are only possible for trivial languages.",

More specifically, in this paper we seek to answer the following question: Given a network in which the majority of nodes are controlled by a malicious adversary and whose topology is changing every round, is it possible to develop a protocol with polynomially-bounded memory per processor that guarantees throughput-efficient and correct end-to-end communication? We answer the question affirmatively for extremely general corruption patterns: we only request that the topology of the network and the corruption pattern of the adversary leaves at least one path each round connecting the sender and receiver through honest nodes (though this path may change at every round). Out construction works in the public-key setting and enjoys bounded memory per processor (that does not depend on the amount of traffic and is polynomial in the network size.) Our protocol achieves optimal transfer rate with negligible decoding error. We stress that our protocol assumes no knowledge of which nodes are corrupted nor which path is reliable at any round, and is also fully distributed with nodes making decisions locally, so that they need not know the topology of the network at any time.",

In this paper we propose ways to exploit the fact that, in a typically rich scattering environment, the radio channel response decorrelates quite rapidly in space. Specifically, we describe a physical-layer algorithm that combines channel probing (M complex frequency response samples over a bandwidth W) with hypothesis testing to determine whether current and prior communication attempts are made by the same user (same channel response). In this way, legitimate users can be reliably authenticated and false users can be reliably detected. To evaluate the feasibility of our algorithm, we simulate spatially variable channel responses in real environments using the WiSE ray-tracing tool; and we analyze the ability of a receiver to discriminate between transmitters (users) based on their channel frequency responses in a given office environment. For several rooms in the extremities of the building we considered, we have confirmed the efficacy of our approach under static channel conditions. For example, measuring five frequency response samples over a bandwidth of 100 MHz and using a transmit power of 100 mW, valid users can be verified with 99% confidence while rejecting false users with greater than 95% confidence.",

In the proposed technique, higher strength bit plane of digital signature watermark is embedded in to a significant bit plane of the original image. The combination of bit planes (image and watermark) selection is an important issue. Therefore, a mechanism is developed for appropriate bit plane selection. Ten different attacks are selected to test different alternatives. These attacks are given different weightings as appropriate to user requirement. A weighted correlation coefficient for retrieved watermark is estimated for each of the alternatives. Based on these estimated values optimal bit plane combination is identified for a given user requirement. The proposed method is found to be useful for authentication and to prove legal ownership. We observed better results by our proposed method in comparison with the previously reported work on pseudorandom watermark embedded in least significant bit (LSB) plane.",

Motivated by applications in Kiosk computing and multi-factor authentication, we consider three security models: (1) the mobile device is trusted, (2) at most one of the terminal or the mobile device is dishonest, and (3) both the terminal and device are dishonest but they do not collude or communicate. We give two protocols and investigate them under the abovementioned models. We point out a form of replay attack that renders some other straightforward implementations cumbersome to use. To enhance user-friendliness, we propose a solution using visual cues embedded into the 2D barcodes and incorporate the framework of \"augmented reality\" for easy verifications through visual inspection.

In this paper, we design a pollution-free P2P content sharing system, Green, by exploiting the inherent content-based information and the social-based reputation. In Green, a content provider (i.e., creator or sharer) publishes the information of his shared contents to a group of content maintainers self-organized in a security overlay for providing the mechanisms of redundancy and reliability, so that a content requestor can obtain and filter the information of his requested content from the associated maintainers. We employ a reputation model to help the requestor better identify the polluted contents, and then utilize the social (friend-related) information to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our reputation model. Now, the requestor could easily select an authentic content version for downloading. While downloading, each requestor performs a realtime integrity verification and takes prompt protection to handle the content pollution. To further improve the system performance, we devise a scalable probabilistic verification scheme. Green is broadly applicable for both structured and unstructured overlay applications, and moreover, it is able to defeat various kinds of content pollution attacks without incurring significant overhead on the participating users. The evaluation in massive-scale networks validates the success of Green against the content pollution.",

Here we have divided the protocol into two different parts. The first part deals with Routing layer information; in this part we have tried to implement a possible strategy for detecting and isolating the malicious nodes. A trust counter for each node is determined which can be actively increased and decreased depending upon the trust value for the purpose of forwarding the packets from source node to destination node with the help of intermediate nodes. A threshold level is also predetermined to detect the malicious nodes. If the value of the node in trust counter is less than the threshold value then the node is denoted 'malicious'. The second part of our protocol deals with the security in the link layer. For this security reason we have used CTR (Counter) approach for authentication and encryption. We have simulated all our strategies and schemes in NS-2, the result of which gives a conclusion that our proposed protocol i.e. Assured Neighbor based Security Protocol can perform high packet delivery against various intruders and also packet delivery ratio against mobility with low delays and low overheads.",

Our protocol is related to the Stern identification scheme but has a reduced communication cost compared to previous code-based zero-knowledge schemes, moreover our scheme permits to obtain a very low size of public key and secret key. The contribution of this paper is twofold, first we propose a variation on the Stern authentication scheme which permits to decrease asymptotically the cheating probability to 1/2 rather than 2/3 (and very close to 1/2 in practice) but with less communication. Our solution is based on deriving new challenges from the secret key through cyclic shifts of the initial public key syndrome; a new proof of soundness for this case is given Secondly we propose a new way to deal with hashed commitments in zero-knowledge schemes based on Stern's scheme, so that in terms of communication, on the average, only one hash value is sent rather than two or three. Overall our new scheme has the good features of having a zero-knowledge security proof based on well known hard problem of coding theory, a small size of secret and public key (a few hundred bits), a small calculation complexity, for an overall communication cost of 19kb for authentication (for a $2^{16}$ security) and a signature of size of 93kb (11.5kB) (for security $2^{80}$), an improvement of 40% compared to previous schemes based on coding theory.",

We use this framework to conduct a comparative information-theoretic analysis of two biometric systems that are based on linear error correction codes, namely fuzzy commitment and secure sketches. We derive upper bounds for the probability of false rejection ($P_{FR}$) and false acceptance ($P_{FA}$) for these systems. We use mutual information to quantify the information leaked about a user's biometric identity, in the scenario where one or multiple biometric enrollments of the user are fully or partially compromised. We also quantify the probability of successful attack ($P_{SA}$) based on the compromised information. Our analysis reveals that fuzzy commitment and secure sketch systems have identical $P_{FR}, P_{FA}, P_{SA}$ and information leakage, but secure sketch systems have lower storage requirements. We analyze both single-factor (keyless) and two-factor (key-based) variants of secure biometrics, and consider the most general scenarios in which a single user may provide noisy biometric enrollments at several access control devices, some of which may be subsequently compromised by an attacker. Our analysis highlights the revocability and reusability properties of key-based systems and exposes a subtle design tradeoff between reducing information leakage from compromised systems and preventing successful attacks on systems whose data have not been compromised.",

Namely, we focus on the secrecy and authenticity properties while keeping a high usability. In this sense, users are forced to blindly trust the system administrators and developers. Moreover, as far as we know, the use of formal methodologies for the verification of security properties of communication protocols isn't yet a common practice. We propose here a methodology to fill this gap, i.e., to analyse both the security of the proposed protocol and the pertinence of the underlying premises. In this concern, we propose the definition and formal evaluation of a protocol for the distribution of digital identities. Once distributed, these identities can be used to verify integrity and source of information. We base our security analysis on tools for automatic verification of security protocols widely accepted by the scientific community, and on the principles they are based upon. In addition, it is assumed perfect cryptographic primitives in order to focus the analysis on the exchange of protocol messages. The main property of our protocol is the incorporation of tickets, created using digests of chaos based nonces (numbers used only once) and users' personal data. Combined with a multichannel authentication scheme with some previous knowledge, these tickets provide security during the whole protocol by univocally linking each registering user with a single request.

    "abstract": "In the world of the Internet, Web Servers such as Apache and Internet Information Server (IIS) were developed to exchange information among client computers having different Operation System. They have only the function of displaying static information such as HTML files and image files into the Web Browser. However, when the information is updated, the administrator updates it by manual operation. In some cases, because it is necessary to update several places about the same information, the work load becomes high than it is assume and update error and update omission may occur. These problems were solved by use of a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) program such as a bulletin board system and a Blog system. However, these programs opened to Internet have often no user authentication mechanism and no access control mechanism. That is, they have the problem that user can access it freely only by getting the URL and inputting it to a Web Browser. Therefore, in this paper, we show a method to add the user authentication and access control mechanism for them. It is called virtual use method of CGI and is realized in the case of introducing the Destination Addressing Control System (DACS) Scheme, which is a kind of Policy Based Network Management Scheme (PBNM). As the result, this kind of the CGI program can be used in the organization with the above two functions.",

    "abstract": "Secure communication between two nodes in a network depends on reliable key management systems that generate and distribute keys between communicating nodes and a secure routing protocol that establishes a route between them. But due to lack of central server and infrastructure in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), this is major problem to manage the keys in the network. Dynamically changes in network's topology causes weak trust relationship among the nodes in the network. In MANETs a mobile node operates as not only end terminal but also as an intermediate router. Therefore, a multi-hop scenario occurs for communication in MANETs; where there may be one or more malicious nodes in between source and destination. A routing protocol is said to be secure that detects the detrimental effects of malicious node(s in the path from source to destination). In this paper, we proposed a key management scheme and a secure routing protocol that secures on demand routing protocol such as DSR and AODV. We assume that MANETs is divided into groups having a group leader in each group. Group leader has responsibility of key management in its group. Proposed key management scheme is a decentralized scheme that does not require any Trusted Third Party (TTP) for key management. In proposed key management system, both a new node and group leader authenticates each other mutually before joining the network. While proposed secure routing protocol allows both communicating parties as well as intermediate nodes to authenticate other nodes and maintains message integrity",

    "abstract": "Mobile IPv6 control signalling messages generally act as informants to the home agent (HA) and the correspondent node (CN) regarding a mobile node's (MN's) new address when its network attachment point changes. Messages should be protected to avoid different security attacks. In the existing standard, control signalling messages between HA and MN are frequently authenticated with IKEv2 and X.509 certificates via IPSec. These signalling messages between MN and CN are so far protected by an effective but insecure protocol. A protocol that uses Binding Update Route Optimisation has security vulnerabilities that allow redirection of traffic by attackers. This traffic is intercepted and then false binding updates is sent along with packet eavesdropping and Denial of Service (DoS) that disrupts any communication. Due to lack of ineffective authentication procedures to ascertain the validity of the users or hide the location data of HoA and CoA, security issues mentioned above will occur. This paper presents some of existing protecting control signalling message protocols, as well as some proposed approaches for designing a secure method-based private key IP address between an MN and a CN. Using Private Key Based Binding Update (PKBU), care-of-address (CoA) can thus be protected against False Binding Update (FBU), Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.",

    "abstract": "Comparing to well protected data frames, Wi-Fi management frames (MFs) are extremely vulnerable to various attacks. Since MFs are transmitted without encryption, attackers can forge them easily. Such attacks can be detected in cooperative environment such as Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS). However, in non-cooperative environment it is difficult for a single station to identify these spoofing attacks using Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based detection, due to the strong correlation of RSS to both the transmission power (Txpower) and the location of the sender. By exploiting some unique characteristics (i.e., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of the Channel State Information (CSI), a standard feature in 802.11n Specification, we design a prototype, called CSITE, to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames by a single station without external support. Our design CSITE, built upon off-the-shelf hardware, achieves precise spoofing detection without collaboration and in-advance finger-print. Several novel techniques are designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel dynamics. To verify the performances of our solution, we implement a prototype of our design and conduct extensive evaluations in various scenarios. Our test results show that our design significantly outperforms the RSS-based method in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency: we observe about 8 times improvement by CSITE over RSS-based method on the falsely accepted attacking frames.",

We derive the attacking strategy that provides the tightest bound on the error region, given the statistics of the side information. This turns out to be a zero mean, circularly symmetric Gaussian density whose correlation matrices may be obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem. We propose an iterative algorithm for its solution: Starting from the closed form solution of a relaxed problem, we obtain, by projection, an initial feasible solution; then, by an iterative procedure, we look for the fixed point solution of the problem. Numerical results show that for cases of interest the iterative approach converges, and perturbation analysis shows that the found solution is a local minimum.",

These include the physical fuses on the device itself as well as on the network layer (such as integrated security components), security measures (such as employee agreements, contract clauses), insurance coverage, but also software technical protection at the application level (e.g. password protection, encryption, secure container).

The hardware interacts with servers at the back for authentication and identification of users and for data storage pertaining to a particular user. The software module manages database, handles identities, provide authentication and secure communication between the various system components. It will also provide a component to the end users. This component can be in the form of software for computer or executable binaries for PoS devices. The idea is to receive data in the embedded system from data reader and smart card. After manipulations, the updated data is imprinted on smart card memory and also updated in the back end servers maintaining database. The information to be sent to a server is sent through a PoS device which has multiple transfer mediums involving wired and un-wired mediums. The user device also acts as an updater; therefore, whenever the smart card is inserted by user, it is automatically updated by synchronizing with back-end database.

    "abstract": "Computer users are generally authenticated by means of a password. Unfortunately passwords are often forgotten and replacement is expensive and inconvenient. Some people write their passwords down but these records can easily be lost or stolen. The option we explore is to find a way to cue passwords securely. The specific cueing technique we report on in this paper employs images as cues. The idea is to elicit textual descriptions of the images, which can then be used as passwords. We have defined a set of metrics for the kind of image that could function effectively as a password cue. We identified five candidate image types and ran an experiment to identify the image class with the best performance in terms of the defined metrics. The first experiment identified inkblot-type images as being superior. We tested this image, called a cueblot, in a real-life environment. We allowed users to tailor their cueblot until they felt they could describe it, and they then entered a description of the cueblot as their password. The cueblot was displayed at each subsequent authentication attempt to cue the password. Unfortunately, we found that users did not exploit the cueing potential of the cueblot, and while there were a few differences between textual descriptions of cueblots and non-cued passwords, they were not compelling. Hence our attempts to alleviate the difficulties people experience with passwords, by giving them access to a tailored cue, did not have the desired effect. We have to conclude that the password mechanism might well be unable to benefit from bolstering activities such as this one.",

    "abstract": "Single Sign-On (SSO) systems simplify login procedures by using an an Identity Provider (IdP) to issue authentication tokens which can be consumed by Service Providers (SPs). Traditionally, IdPs are modeled as trusted third parties. This is reasonable for SSO systems like Kerberos, MS Passport and SAML, where each SP explicitely specifies which IdP he trusts. However, in open systems like OpenID and OpenID Connect, each user may set up his own IdP, and a discovery phase is added to the protocol flow. Thus it is easy for an attacker to set up its own IdP. In this paper we use a novel approach for analyzing SSO authentication schemes by introducing a malicious IdP. With this approach we evaluate one of the most popular and widely deployed SSO protocols - OpenID. We found four novel attack classes on OpenID, which were not covered by previous research, and show their applicability to real-life implementations. As a result, we were able to compromise 11 out of 16 existing OpenID implementations like Sourceforge, Drupal and ownCloud. We automated discovery of these attacks in a open source tool OpenID Attacker, which additionally allows fine-granular testing of all parameters in OpenID implementations. Our research helps to better understand the message flow in the OpenID protocol, trust assumptions in the different components of the system, and implementation issues in OpenID components. It is applicable to other SSO systems like OpenID Connect and SAML. All OpenID implementations have been informed about their vulnerabilities and we supported them in fixing the issues.",

The widespread use of computing devices in daily life has underscored the need for zero-effort deauthentication schemes. However, the quest for eliminating user effort may lead to hidden security flaws in the authentication schemes. As a case in point, we investigate a prominent zero-effort deauthentication scheme, called ZEBRA, which provides an interesting and a useful solution to a difficult problem as demonstrated in the original paper. We identify a subtle incorrect assumption in its adversary model that leads to a fundamental design flaw. We exploit this to break the scheme with a class of attacks that are much easier for a human to perform in a realistic adversary model, compared to the na\\\"ive attacks studied in the ZEBRA paper. For example, one of our main attacks, where the human attacker has to opportunistically mimic only the victim's keyboard typing activity at a nearby terminal, is significantly more successful compared to the na\\\"ive attack that requires mimicking keyboard and mouse activities as well as keyboard-mouse movements. Further, by understanding the design flaws in ZEBRA as cases of tainted input, we show that we can draw on well-understood design principles to improve ZEBRA's security.",

MMH$^*$, which was shown to be $\\Delta$-universal by Halevi and Krawczyk in 1997, is a well-known universal hash function family. We introduce a variant of MMH$^*$, that we call GRDH, where we use an arbitrary integer $n>1$ instead of prime $p$ and let the keys $\\mathbf{x}=\\langle x_1, \\ldots, x_k \\rangle \\in \\mathbb{Z}_n^k$ satisfy the conditions $\\gcd(x_i,n)=t_i$ ($1\\leq i\\leq k$), where $t_1,\\ldots,t_k$ are given positive divisors of $n$. Then via connecting the universal hashing problem to the number of solutions of restricted linear congruences, we prove that the family GRDH is an $\\varepsilon$-almost-$\\Delta$-universal family of hash functions for some $\\varepsilon<1$ if and only if $n$ is odd and $\\gcd(x_i,n)=t_i=1$ $(1\\leq i\\leq k)$.

However, many combination of these mechanisms lead to insecure deployments. We present the largest study to date that investigates the security of the email and chat infrastructures. We used active Internet-wide scans to determine the amount of secure service deployments, and passive monitoring to investigate if user agents actually use this opportunity to secure their communications. We addressed both the client-to-server interactions as well as server-to-server forwarding mechanisms that these protocols offer, and the use of encryption and authentication methods in the process.

    "abstract": "The fast-growing Internet traffic is increasingly becoming content-based and driven by mobile users, with users more interested in data rather than its source. This has precipitated the need for an information-centric Internet architecture. Research in information-centric networks (ICNs) have resulted in novel architectures, e.g., CCN/NDN, DONA, and PSIRP/PURSUIT; all agree on named data based addressing and pervasive caching as integral design components. With network-wide content caching, enforcement of content access control policies become non-trivial. Each caching node in the network needs to enforce access control policies with the help of the content provider. This becomes inefficient and prone to unbounded latencies especially during provider outages. In this paper, we propose an efficient access control framework for ICN, which allows legitimate users to access and use the cached content directly, and does not require verification/authentication by an online provider authentication server or the content serving router. This framework would help reduce the impact of system down-time from server outages and reduce delivery latency by leveraging caching while guaranteeing access only to legitimate users. Experimental/simulation results demonstrate the suitability of this scheme for all users, but particularly for mobile users, especially in terms of the security and latency overheads.",

A signature personify a person and a graphical signature is easier to recall than other drawings. This paper proposes a new graphical Signature-based User Identification System named SUIS. It is based on a 2D grid technology, that is used to draw, digitize and store the signature for user identification. SUIS is categorized as both a cognometric and drawmetric system. Unlike other systems that use 2D grid: We take one cell in a grid as one pixel in the drawing; for signature matching, the signature drawn has to follow the same grid cells as the signature stored, independent of the sequence; and that the system is not based on any machine learning model. Increasing the number of grid cells increases the password space, and decreasing the size of the grid cell increases the precision of the signature. These characteristics makes SUIS: (1) Rigorous enough to be a password system, but easy enough to be usable. (2) Independent of the language and device used to draw the signature. (3) Efficient and practical to be used for online authentication systems.",

    "abstract": "The Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the latest mobile standard being implemented globally to provide connectivity and access to advanced services for personal mobile devices. Moreover, LTE networks are considered to be one of the main pillars for the deployment of Machine to Machine (M2M) communication systems and the spread of the Internet of Things (IoT). As an enabler for advanced communications services with a subscription count in the billions, security is of capital importance in LTE. Although legacy GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) networks are known for being insecure and vulnerable to rogue base stations, LTE is assumed to guarantee confidentiality and strong authentication. However, LTE networks are vulnerable to security threats that tamper availability, privacy and authentication. This manuscript, which summarizes and expands the results presented by the author at ShmooCon 2016 \\cite{jover2016lte}, investigates the insecurity rationale behind LTE protocol exploits and LTE rogue base stations based on the analysis of real LTE radio link captures from the production network. Implementation results are discussed from the actual deployment of LTE rogue base stations, IMSI catchers and exploits that can potentially block a mobile device. A previously unknown technique to potentially track the location of mobile devices as they move from cell to cell is also discussed, with mitigations being proposed.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a non-convex formulation to recover the authentic structure from the corrupted real data. Typically, the specific structure is assumed to be low rank, which holds for a wide range of data, such as images and videos. Meanwhile, the corruption is assumed to be sparse. In the literature, such a problem is known as Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), which usually recovers the low rank structure by approximating the rank function with a nuclear norm and penalizing the error by an $\\ell_1$-norm. Although RPCA is a convex formulation and can be solved effectively, the introduced norms are not tight approximations, which may cause the solution to deviate from the authentic one. Therefore, we consider here a non-convex relaxation, consisting of a Schatten-$p$ norm and an $\\ell_q$-norm that promote low rank and sparsity respectively. We derive a proximal iteratively reweighted algorithm (PIRA) to solve the problem. Our algorithm is based on an alternating direction method of multipliers, where in each iteration we linearize the underlying objective function that allows us to have a closed form solution. We demonstrate that solutions produced by the linearized approximation always converge and have a tighter approximation than the convex counterpart. Experimental results on benchmarks show encouraging results of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Privacy amplification is the task by which two cooperating parties transform a shared weak secret, about which an eavesdropper may have side information, into a uniformly random string uncorrelated from the eavesdropper. Privacy amplification against passive adversaries, where it is assumed that the communication is over a public but authenticated channel, can be achieved in the presence of classical as well as quantum side information by a single-message protocol based on strong extractors. In 2009 Dodis and Wichs devised a two-message protocol to achieve privacy amplification against active adversaries, where the public communication channel is no longer assumed to be authenticated, through the use of a strengthening of strong extractors called non-malleable extractors which they introduced. Dodis and Wichs only analyzed the case of classical side information. We consider the task of privacy amplification against active adversaries with quantum side information. Our main result is showing that the Dodis-Wichs protocol remains secure in this scenario provided its main building block, the non-malleable extractor, satisfies a notion of quantum-proof non-malleability which we introduce. We show that an adaptation of a recent construction of non-malleable extractors due to Chattopadhyay et al. is quantum proof, thereby providing the first protocol for privacy amplification that is secure against active quantum adversaries. Our protocol is quantitatively comparable to the near-optimal protocols known in the classical setting.",

    "abstract": "A spoof attack, a subset of presentation attacks, is the use of an artificial replica of a biometric in an attempt to circumvent a biometric sensor. Liveness detection, or presentation attack detection, distinguishes between live and fake biometric traits and is based on the principle that additional information can be garnered above and beyond the data procured by a standard authentication system to determine if a biometric measure is authentic. The goals for the Liveness Detection (LivDet) competitions are to compare software-based fingerprint liveness detection and artifact detection algorithms (Part 1), as well as fingerprint systems which incorporate liveness detection or artifact detection capabilities (Part 2), using a standardized testing protocol and large quantities of spoof and live tests. The competitions are open to all academic and industrial institutions which have a solution for either softwarebased or system-based fingerprint liveness detection. The LivDet competitions have been hosted in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015 and have shown themselves to provide a crucial look at the current state of the art in liveness detection schemes. There has been a noticeable increase in the number of participants in LivDet competitions as well as a noticeable decrease in error rates across competitions. Participants have grown from four to the most recent thirteen submissions for Fingerprint Part 1. Fingerprints Part 2 has held steady at two submissions each competition in 2011 and 2013 and only one for the 2015 edition. The continuous increase of competitors demonstrates a growing interest in the topic.",

    "abstract": "In the scope of VANETs, nature of exchanged safety/warning messages renders itself highly location dependent as it is usually for incident reporting. Thus, vehicles are required to periodically exchange beacon messages that include speed, time and GPS location information. In this paper paper, we present a physical layer assisted message authentication scheme that uses Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation to verify the message originator location based on the claimed location information. Within the considered vehicular communication settings, fundamental limits of AoA estimation are developed in terms of its Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) and existence of efficient estimator. The problem of deciding whether the received signal is originated from the claimed GPS location is formulated as a two sided hypotheses testing problem whose solution is given by Wald test statics. Moreover, we use correct decision, $P_D$, and false alarm, $P_F$, probabilities as a quantitative performance measure. The observation posterior likelihood function is shown to satisfy regularity conditions necessary for asymptotic normality of the ML-AoA estimator. Thus, we give $P_D$ and $P_F$ in a closed form. We extend the potential of physical layer contribution in security to provide physical layer assisted secret key agreement (SKA) protocol. A public key (PK) based SKA in which communicating vehicles are required to validate their respective physical location. We show that the risk of the Man in the Middle attack, which is common in PK-SKA protocols without a trusted third party, is waived up to the literal meaning of the word \"middle\".",

    "abstract": "Both authentication and deauthentication are instrumental for preventing unauthorized access to computer and data assets. While there are obvious motivating factors for using strong authentication mechanisms, convincing users to deauthenticate is not straight-forward, since deauthentication is not considered mandatory. A user who leaves a logged-in workstation unattended (especially for a short time) is typically not inconvenienced in any way; in fact, the other way around: no annoying reauthentication is needed upon return. However, an unattended workstation is trivially susceptible to the well-known \"lunchtime attack\" by any nearby adversary who simply takes over the departed user's log-in session. At the same time, since deathentication does not intrinsically require user secrets, it can, in principle, be made unobtrusive. To this end, this paper designs the first automatic user deauthentication system, FADEWICH, that does not rely on biometric- or behavior-based techniques (e.g., keystroke dynamics) and does not require users to carry any devices. It uses physical properties of wireless signals and the effect of human bodies on their propagation. To assess FADEWICH's feasibility and performance, extensive experiments were conducted with its prototype. Results show that it suffices to have nine inexpensive wireless sensors deployed in a shared office setting to correctly deauthenticate all users within six seconds (90% within four seconds) after they leave their workstation's vicinity. We considered two realistic scenarios where the adversary attempts to subvert FADEWICH and showed that lunchtime attacks fail.",

Voice assistants such as Siri, Google Now and Cortana, have become our everyday fixtures, especially in scenarios where touch interfaces are inconvenient or even dangerous to use, such as driving or exercising. Nevertheless, the open nature of the voice channel makes voice assistants difficult to secure and exposed to various attacks as demonstrated by security researchers. In this paper, we present VAuth, the first system that provides continuous and usable authentication for voice assistants. We design VAuth to fit in various widely-adopted wearable devices, such as eyeglasses, earphones/buds and necklaces, where it collects the body-surface vibrations of the user and matches it with the speech signal received by the voice assistant's microphone. VAuth guarantees that the voice assistant executes only the commands that originate from the voice of the owner. We have evaluated VAuth with 18 users and 30 voice commands and find it to achieve an almost perfect matching accuracy with less than 0.1% false positive rate, regardless of VAuth's position on the body and the user's language, accent or mobility. VAuth successfully thwarts different practical attacks, such as replayed attacks, mangled voice attacks, or impersonation attacks. It also has low energy and latency overheads and is compatible with most existing voice assistants.",

    "abstract": "Accurate face recognition techniques make a series of critical applications possible: policemen could employ it to retrieve criminals' faces from surveillance video streams; cross boarder travelers could pass a face authentication inspection line without the involvement of officers. Nonetheless, when public security heavily relies on such intelligent systems, the designers should deliberately consider the emerging attacks aiming at misleading those systems employing face recognition. We propose a kind of brand new attack against face recognition systems, which is realized by illuminating the subject using infrared according to the adversarial examples worked out by our algorithm, thus face recognition systems can be bypassed or misled while simultaneously the infrared perturbations cannot be observed by raw eyes. Through launching this kind of attack, an attacker not only can dodge surveillance cameras. More importantly, he can impersonate his target victim and pass the face authentication system, if only the victim's photo is acquired by the attacker. Again, the attack is totally unobservable by nearby people, because not only the light is invisible, but also the device we made to launch the attack is small enough. According to our study on a large dataset, attackers have a very high success rate with a over 70\\% success rate for finding such an adversarial example that can be implemented by infrared. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one to shed light on the severity of threat resulted from infrared adversarial examples against face recognition.",

Recent advances in the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have facilitated the task of analyzing the veracity and authenticity of largely distributed image datasets. We examine in this paper the problem of identifying the camera model or type that was used to take an image and that can be spoofed. Due to the linear nature of CNNs and the high-dimensionality of images, neural networks are vulnerable to attacks with adversarial examples. These examples are imperceptibly different from correctly classified images but are misclassified with high confidence by CNNs. In this paper, we describe a counter-forensic method capable of subtly altering images to change their estimated camera model when they are analyzed by any CNN-based camera model detector. Our method can use both the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) or the Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) to craft these adversarial images and does not require direct access to the CNN. Our results show that even advanced deep learning architectures trained to analyze images and obtain camera model information are still vulnerable to our proposed method.",

    ],
    "abstract": "In spite of the benefits of biometric-based authentication systems, there are few concerns raised because of the sensitivity of biometric data to outliers, low performance caused due to intra-class variations and privacy invasion caused by information leakage. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid fusion framework where only the protected modalities are combined to fulfill the requirement of secrecy and performance improvement. This paper presents a method to integrate cancelable modalities utilizing mean-closure weighting (MCW) score level and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory based decision level fusion for iris and fingerprint to mitigate the limitations in the individual score or decision fusion mechanisms. The proposed hybrid fusion scheme incorporates the similarity scores from different matchers corresponding to each protected modality. The individual scores obtained from different matchers for each modality are combined using MCW score fusion method. The MCW technique achieves the optimal weight for each matcher involved in the score computation. Further, DS theory is applied to the induced scores to output the final decision. The rigorous experimental evaluations on three virtual databases indicate that the proposed hybrid fusion framework outperforms over the component level or individual fusion methods (score level and decision level fusion). As a result, we achieve (48%,66%), (72%,86%) and (49%,38%) of performance improvement over unimodal cancelable iris and unimodal cancelable fingerprint verification systems for Virtual_A, Virtual_B and Virtual_C databases, respectively. Also, the proposed method is robust enough to the variability of scores and outliers satisfying the requirement of secure authentication.",

However, this increases the chance of handover due to smaller coverage of a micro base station, i.e., home eNodeB (HeNB) in 5G. Subsequently, the latency will increase as the costs of authenticated key exchange protocol, which ensures entity authentication and communication confidentiality for secure handover, also increase totally. Thus, this work presents a secure region-based handover scheme (ReHand) with user anonymity and fast revocation for SCNs in 5G. ReHand greatly reduces the communication costs when UEs roam between small cells within the region of a macro base station, i.e., eNB in 5G, and the computation costs due to the employment of symmetry-based cryptographic operations. Compared to the three elaborated related works, ReHand dramatically reduces the costs from 82.92% to 99.99%. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates the security of ReHand by theoretically formal proofs.",

The PLA protocol uses generalized likelihood-ratio testing based on the line-of-sight (LOS), single-input multiple-output channel-state information in order to mitigate impersonation attempts from an adversary node. We study the detection performance, develop a queueing model that captures the delay impacts of erroneous decisions in the PLA (i.e., the false alarms and missed detections), and model three different adversary strategies: data injection, disassociation, and Sybil attacks. Our main contribution is the derivation of analytical delay performance bounds that allow us to quantify the delay introduced by PLA that potentially can degrade the performance in mission-critical MTC networks. For the delay analysis, we utilize tools from stochastic network calculus. Our results show that with a sufficient number of receive antennas (approx. 4-8) and sufficiently strong LOS components from legitimate devices, PLA is a viable option for securing mission-critical MTC systems, despite the low latency requirements associated to corresponding use cases. Furthermore, we find that PLA can be very effective in detecting the considered attacks, and in particular, it can significantly reduce the delay impacts of disassociation and Sybil attacks.",

In this paper, we propose OR-Benchmark, an open and highly reconfigurable general-purpose digital watermarking benchmarking framework, which has the following two key features: 1) all the interfaces are public and general enough to support all watermarking applications and benchmarking tasks we can think of; 2) end users can easily extend the functionalities and freely configure what watermarking algorithms are tested, what system components are used, how the benchmarking process runs, and what results should be produced. We implemented a prototype of this framework as a MATLAB software package and used it to benchmark a number of digital watermarking algorithms involving two types of watermarks for content authentication and self-restoration purposes. The benchmarking results demonstrated the advantages of the proposed benchmarking framework, and also gave us some useful insights about existing image authentication and self-restoration watermarking algorithms which are an important but less studied topic in digital watermarking.",

    "abstract": "The Quantum Oracle Classification (QOC) problem is to classify a function, given only quantum black box access, into one of several classes without necessarily determining the entire function. Generally, QOC captures a very wide range of problems in quantum query complexity. However, relatively little is known about many of these problems. In this work, we analyze the a subclass of the QOC problems where there is a group structure. That is, suppose the range of the unknown function A is a commutative group G, which induces a commutative group law over the entire function space. Then we consider the case where A is drawn uniformly at random from some subgroup A of the function space. Moreover, there is a homomorpism f on A, and the goal is to determine f(A). This class of problems is very general, and covers several interesting cases, such as oracle evaluation; polynomial interpolation, evaluation, and extrapolation; and parity. These problems are important in the study of message authentication codes in the quantum setting, and may have other applications. We exactly characterize the quantum query complexity of every instance of QOC with group structure in terms of a particular counting problem. That is, we provide an algorithm for this general class of problems whose success probability is determined by the solution to the counting problem, and prove its exact optimality. Unfortunately, solving this counting problem in general is a non-trivial task, and we resort to analyzing special cases. Our bounds unify some existing results, such as the existing oracle evaluation and parity bounds. In the case of polynomial interpolation and evaluation, our bounds give new results for secret sharing and information theoretic message authentication codes in the quantum setting.",

    "abstract": "Location Aware Password Protection System (LAPPS) is designed to strengthen the security of traditional password protection systems. This is achieved by adding several layers of protection to the passwords that most traditional password protection systems generate. The current implementation looks at the Password/Pin numbers of Credit/Debit cards that are used on Automated Teller Machine (ATM),though the underlying design of the system can be used in many other scenarios. A password that is generated will be allocated to a particular user and to the ATM that is nearest to the user. LAPPS ensures the following qualities of the passwords that it generates. Location Awareness: The passwords are generated according to the users' geographical area, that they request their passwords from. So a password will only be active in just one location. Time Awareness: A password will only be valid for five minutes. The unused passwords will be discarded. Dynamic: The user has to have a new password each time he/she logs in. A password is generated to be used only once. User Oriented/Specific: The received password can only be used by the requester, and can only be used on its allocated ATM. Two Factor Authenticity: The confidential information will be secured using two-factor authentication. For extra security, a Pin generating device has been introduced. This will produce an eight digit number that the user has to supply to the mobile application, before requesting for a password. The user can obtain a pin number by inserting his/her Debit/Credit card and the fixed password that has been allocated when the user registers with the system.",

    "abstract": "Security and privacy are major concerns in modern communication networks. In recent years, the information theory of covert communications, where the very presence of the communication is undetectable to a watchful and determined adversary, has been of great interest. This emerging body of work has focused on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), discrete memoryless channels (DMCs), and optical channels. In contrast, our recent work introduced the information-theoretic limits for covert communications over packet channels whose packet timings are governed by a Poisson point process. However, actual network packet arrival times do not generally conform to the Poisson process assumption, and thus here we consider the extension of our work to timing channels characterized by more general renewal processes of rate $\\lambda$. We consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, the source of the packets on the channel cannot be authenticated by Willie, and therefore Alice can insert packets into the channel. We show that if the total number of transmitted packets by Jack is $N$, Alice can covertly insert $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{N}\\right)$ packets and, if she transmits more, she will be detected by Willie. In the second scenario, packets are authenticated by Willie but we assume that Alice and Bob share a secret key; hence, Alice alters the timings of the packets according to a pre-shared codebook with Bob to send information to him over a $G/M/1$ queue with service rate $\\mu>\\lambda$. We show that Alice can covertly and reliably transmit $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ bits to Bob when the total number of packets sent from Jack to Steve is $N$.",

    "abstract": "We present a practical and highly secure method for the authentication of chips based on a new concept for implementing strong Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). Its qualitatively novel feature is a remote reconfiguration in which the delay stages of the PUF are arranged to a random pattern within a subset of the FPGA's gates. Before the reconfiguration is performed during authentication the PUF simply does not exist. Hence even if an attacker has the chip under control previously she can gain no useful information about the PUF. This feature, together with a strict renunciation of any error correction and challenge selection criteria that depend on individual properties of the PUF that goes into the field make our strong PUF construction immune to all machine learning attacks presented in the literature. More sophisticated attacks on our strong-PUF construction will be difficult, because they require the attacker to learn or directly measure the properties of the complete FPGA. A fully functional reference implementation for a secure \"chip biometrics\" is presented. We remotely configure ten 64-stage arbiter PUFs out of 1428 lookup tables within a time of 25 seconds and then receive one \"fingerprint\" from each PUF within 1 msec.",

    "abstract": "Numerous fake images spread on social media today and can severely jeopardize the credibility of online content to public. In this paper, we employ deep networks to learn distinct fake image related features. In contrast to authentic images, fake images tend to be eye-catching and visually striking. Compared with traditional visual recognition tasks, it is extremely challenging to understand these psychologically triggered visual patterns in fake images. Traditional general image classification datasets, such as ImageNet set, are designed for feature learning at the object level but are not suitable for learning the hyper-features that would be required by image credibility analysis. In order to overcome the scarcity of training samples of fake images, we first construct a large-scale auxiliary dataset indirectly related to this task. This auxiliary dataset contains 0.6 million weakly-labeled fake and real images collected automatically from social media. Through an AdaBoost-like transfer learning algorithm, we train a CNN model with a few instances in the target training set and 0.6 million images in the collected auxiliary set. This learning algorithm is able to leverage knowledge from the auxiliary set and gradually transfer it to the target task. Experiments on a real-world testing set show that our proposed domain transferred CNN model outperforms several competing baselines. It obtains superiror results over transfer learning methods based on the general ImageNet set. Moreover, case studies show that our proposed method reveals some interesting patterns for distinguishing fake and authentic images.",

    "abstract": "Research on vehicular networking (V2X) security has produced a range of security mechanisms and protocols tailored for this domain, addressing both security and privacy. Typically, the security analysis of these proposals has largely been informal. However, formal analysis can be used to expose flaws and ultimately provide a higher level of assurance in the protocols. This paper focusses on the formal analysis of a particular element of security mechanisms for V2X found in many proposals: the revocation of malicious or misbehaving vehicles from the V2X system by invalidating their credentials. This revocation needs to be performed in an unlinkable way for vehicle privacy even in the context of vehicles regularly changing their pseudonyms. The REWIRE scheme by Forster et al. and its subschemes BASIC and RTOKEN aim to solve this challenge by means of cryptographic solutions and trusted hardware. Formal analysis using the TAMARIN prover identifies two flaws with some of the functional correctness and authentication properties in these schemes. We then propose Obscure Token (OTOKEN), an extension of REWIRE to enable revocation in a privacy preserving manner. Our approach addresses the functional and authentication properties by introducing an additional key-pair, which offers a stronger and verifiable guarantee of successful revocation of vehicles without resolving the long-term identity. Moreover OTOKEN is the first V2X revocation protocol to be co-designed with a formal model.",

This protocol enables so-called relying parties to delegate user authentication to so-called identity providers. OpenID Connect is one of the newest and most widely deployed single sign-on protocols on the web. Despite its importance, it has not received much attention from security researchers so far, and in particular, has not undergone any rigorous security analysis. In this paper, we carry out the first in-depth security analysis of OpenID Connect. To this end, we use a comprehensive generic model of the web to develop a detailed formal model of OpenID Connect. Based on this model, we then precisely formalize and prove central security properties for OpenID Connect, including authentication, authorization, and session integrity properties. In our modeling of OpenID Connect, we employ security measures in order to avoid attacks on OpenID Connect that have been discovered previously and new attack variants that we document for the first time in this paper. Based on these security measures, we propose security guidelines for implementors of OpenID Connect. Our formal analysis demonstrates that these guidelines are in fact effective and sufficient.",

    "abstract": "Securing the Internet of Things (IoT) is a necessary milestone toward expediting the deployment of its applications and services. In particular, the functionality of the IoT devices is extremely dependent on the reliability of their message transmission. Cyber attacks such as data injection, eavesdropping, and man-in-the-middle threats can lead to security challenges. Securing IoT devices against such attacks requires accounting for their stringent computational power and need for low-latency operations. In this paper, a novel deep learning method is proposed for dynamic watermarking of IoT signals to detect cyber attacks. The proposed learning framework, based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure, enables the IoT devices to extract a set of stochastic features from their generated signal and dynamically watermark these features into the signal. This method enables the IoT's cloud center, which collects signals from the IoT devices, to effectively authenticate the reliability of the signals. Furthermore, the proposed method prevents complicated attack scenarios such as eavesdropping in which the cyber attacker collects the data from the IoT devices and aims to break the watermarking algorithm. Simulation results show that, with an attack detection delay of under 1 second the messages can be transmitted from IoT devices with an almost 100% reliability.",

    "abstract": "The application of Mission Critical Machine Type Communication (MC-MTC) in wireless systems is currently a hot research topic. Wireless systems are considered to provide numerous advantages over wired systems in e.g. industrial applications such as closed loop control. However, due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, such systems are prone to a wide range of cyber attacks. These range from passive eavesdropping attacks to active attacks like data manipulation or masquerade attacks. Therefore it is necessary to provide reliable and efficient security mechanisms. Some of the most important security issues in such a system are to ensure integrity as well as authenticity of exchanged messages over the air between communicating devices. In the present work, an approach on how to achieve this goal in MC-MTC systems based on Physical Layer Security (PHYSEC) is presented. A new method that clusters channel estimates of different transmitters based on a Gaussian Mixture Model is applied for that purpose. Further, an experimental proof-of-concept evaluation is given and we compare the performance of our approach with a mean square error based detection method.",

Users can control smart devices and get living assistance through those HDVAs (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home) using voice. In this work, we study the insecurity of HDVA service by using Amazon Alexa as a case study. We disclose three security vulnerabilities which root in the insecure access control of Alexa services. We then exploit them to devise two proof-of-concept attacks, home burglary and fake order, where the adversary can remotely command the victim's Alexa device to open a door or place an order from Amazon.com. The insecure access control is that the Alexa device not only relies on a single-factor authentication but also takes voice commands even if no people are around. We thus argue that HDVAs should have another authentication factor, a physical presence based access control; that is, they can accept voice commands only when any person is detected nearby. To this end, we devise a Virtual Security Button (VSButton), which leverages the WiFi technology to detect indoor human motions. Once any indoor human motion is detected, the Alexa device is enabled to accept voice commands. Our evaluation results show that it can effectively differentiate indoor motions from the cases of no motion and outdoor motions in both the laboratory and real world settings.",

However, there are known performance issues, making it unsuitable for use in vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose a secure and authenticated key management protocol (SA-KMP) to overcome the shortcomings of the PKI. The SA-KMP scheme distributes repository containing the bindings of the en-tity's identity and its corresponding public key to each vehicle and road side unit. By doing so, certificate exchanges and certificate revocation lists are eliminated. Furthermore, the SA-KMP scheme uses symmetric keys derived based on a 3-D-matrix-based key agreement scheme to reduce the high computational costs of using asymmetric cryptography. We demonstrate the efficiency of the SA-KMP through performance evaluations in terms of transmission and storage overhead, network latency, and key generation time. Analytical results show that the SA-KMP is more scalable and outperforms the certificate-based PKI. Simulation results indicate that the key generation time of the SA-KMP scheme is less than that of the existing Elliptic Curve Diffie--Hellman and Diffie--Hellman protocols. In addition, we use Proverif to prove that the SA-KMP scheme is secure against an active attacker under the Dolev and Yao model and further show that the SA-KMP scheme is secure against denial of service, collusion attacks, and a wide range of other malicious attacks.",

    "abstract": "The email system is the central battleground against phishing and social engineering attacks, and yet email providers still face key challenges to authenticate incoming emails. As a result, attackers can apply spoofing techniques to impersonate a trusted entity to conduct highly deceptive phishing attacks. In this work, we study email spoofing to answer three key questions: (1) How do email providers detect and handle forged emails? (2) Under what conditions can forged emails penetrate the defense to reach user inbox? (3) Once the forged email gets in, how email providers warn users? Is the warning truly effective? We answer these questions through end-to-end measurements on 35 popular email providers (used by billions of users), and extensive user studies (N = 913) that consist of both simulated and real-world phishing experiments. We have four key findings. First, most popular email providers have the necessary protocols to detect spoofing, but still allow forged emails to get into user inbox (e.g., Yahoo Mail, iCloud, Gmail). Second, once a forged email gets in, most email providers have no warnings for users, particularly on mobile email apps. Some providers (e.g., Gmail Inbox) even have misleading UIs that make the forged email look authentic. Third, a few email providers (9/35) have implemented visual security cues for unverified emails, which demonstrate a positive impact to reduce risky user actions. Comparing simulated experiments with realistic phishing tests, we observe that the impact of security cue is less significant when users are caught off guard in the real-world setting.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we aim at building a bridge from poor behavioral data to an effective, quick-response, and robust behavior model for online identity theft detection. We concentrate on this issue in online social networks (OSNs) where users usually have composite behavioral records, consisting of multi-dimensional low-quality data, e.g., offline check-ins and online user generated content (UGC). As an insightful result, we find that there is a complementary effect among different dimensions of records for modeling users' behavioral patterns. To deeply exploit such a complementary effect, we propose a joint model to capture both online and offline features of a user's composite behavior. We evaluate the proposed joint model by comparing with some typical models on two real-world datasets: Foursquare and Yelp. In the widely-used setting of theft simulation (simulating thefts via behavioral replacement), the experimental results show that our model outperforms the existing ones, with the AUC values $0.956$ in Foursquare and $0.947$ in Yelp, respectively. Particularly, the recall (True Positive Rate) can reach up to $65.3\\%$ in Foursquare and $72.2\\%$ in Yelp with the corresponding disturbance rate (False Positive Rate) below $1\\%$. It is worth mentioning that these performances can be achieved by examining only one composite behavior (visiting a place and posting a tip online simultaneously) per authentication, which guarantees the low response latency of our method. This study would give the cybersecurity community new insights into whether and how a real-time online identity authentication can be improved via modeling users' composite behavioral patterns.",

    "abstract": "To facilitate monitoring and management, modern Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) are often equipped with wireless capabilities, which raise the risk of malicious access to IMDs. Although schemes are proposed to secure the IMD access, some issues are still open. First, pre-sharing a long-term key between a patient's IMD and a doctor's programmer is vulnerable since once the doctor's programmer is compromised, all of her patients suffer; establishing a temporary key by leveraging proximity gets rid of pre-shared keys, but as the approach lacks real authentication, it can be exploited by nearby adversaries or through man-in-the-middle attacks. Second, while prolonging the lifetime of IMDs is one of the most important design goals, few schemes explore to lower the communication and computation overhead all at once. Finally, how to safely record the commands issued by doctors for the purpose of forensics, which can be the last measure to protect the patients' rights, is commonly omitted in the existing literature. Motivated by these important yet open problems, we propose an innovative scheme e-SAFE, which significantly improves security and safety, reduces the communication overhead and enables IMD-access forensics. We present a novel lightweight compressive sensing based encryption algorithm to encrypt and compress the IMD data simultaneously, reducing the data transmission overhead by over 50% while ensuring high data confidentiality and usability. Furthermore, we provide a suite of protocols regarding device pairing, dual-factor authentication, and accountability-enabled access.

The most important messages in these networks are broadcast-authenticated periodic one-hop beacons, used for safety and traffic efficiency applications such as collision avoidance and traffic jam detection. However, broadcast authenticity is not sufficient to guarantee message correctness. The goal of misbehavior detection is to analyze application data and knowledge about physical processes in these cyber-physical systems to detect incorrect messages, enabling local revocation of vehicles transmitting malicious messages. Comparative studies between detection mechanisms are rare due to the lack of a reference dataset. We take the first steps to address this challenge by introducing the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior Dataset (VeReMi) and a discussion of valid metrics for such an assessment. VeReMi is the first public extensible dataset, allowing anyone to reproduce the generation process, as well as contribute attacks and use the data to compare new detection mechanisms against existing ones. The result of our analysis shows that the acceptance range threshold and the simple speed check are complementary mechanisms that detect different attacks. This supports the intuitive notion that fusion can lead to better results with data, and we suggest that future work should focus on effective fusion with VeReMi as an evaluation baseline.",

Indeed, if a website adopts a poor password management system, this choice makes useless even the most robust password chosen by its users. In this paper, we first provide a survey of currently adopted password recovery mechanisms. Later, we model an attacker with different capabilities and we show how current password recovery mechanisms can be exploited in our attacker model. Then, we provide a thorough analysis of the password management of some of the Alexa's top 200 websites in different countries, including England, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. Of these 1,000 websites, 722 do not require authentication -- and hence are excluded by our study -- while out of the remaining 278 we focused on 174, since 104 demanded a complex registration procedure. Of these 174, almost 25% of the them have critical vulnerabilities, while 44% have some form of vulnerability. Finally, we propose some effective countermeasures and we point out that, by considering the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May, 2018, most of websites are not compliant with the legislation and may incur in heavy fines. This study, other than being important on its own since it highlights some severe current vulnerabilities and proposes corresponding remedies, has the potential to also have a relevant impact on the EU industrial ecosystem.",

Access token obtained along with ID token allows the application to consume OAuth 2.0 protected resources. In this approach, the client application is bound to a single identity provider. If the client needs to consume a protected resource from a different domain, which only accepts tokens of a defined identity provider, then the client must again follow OpenID Connect protocol to obtain new tokens. This requires user identity details to be stored in the second identity provider as well. This paper proposes an extension to OpenID Connect protocol to overcome this issue. It proposes a client-centric mechanism to exchange identity information as token grants against a trusted identity provider. Once a grant is accepted, resulting token response contains an access token, which is good enough to access protected resources from token issuing identity provider's domain.",

    "abstract": "An empirical investigation of active/continuous authentication for smartphones is presented in this paper by exploiting users' unique application usage data, i.e., distinct patterns of use, modeled by a Markovian process. Variations of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are evaluated for continuous user verification, and challenges due to the sparsity of session-wise data, an explosion of states, and handling unforeseen events in the test data are tackled. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed formulation does not depend on the top N-apps, rather uses the complete app-usage information to achieve low latency. Through experimentation, empirical assessment of the impact of unforeseen events, i.e., unknown applications and unforeseen observations, on user verification is done via a modified edit-distance algorithm for simple sequence matching. It is found that for enhanced verification performance, unforeseen events should be incorporated in the models by adopting smoothing techniques with HMMs. For validation, extensive experiments on two distinct datasets are performed. The marginal smoothing technique is the most effective for user verification in terms of equal error rate (EER) and with a sampling rate of 1/30s^{-1} and 30 minutes of historical data, and the method is capable of detecting an intrusion within ~2.5 minutes of application use.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are a new paradigm that emerged with the rise of the blockchain technology. They allow untrusting parties to arrange agreements. These agreements are encoded as a programming language code and deployed on a blockchain platform, where all participants execute them and maintain their state. Smart contracts are promising since they are automated and decentralized, thus limiting the involvement of third trusted parties, and can contain monetary transfers. Due to these features, many people believe that smart contracts will revolutionize the way we think of distributed applications, information sharing, financial services, and infrastructures. To release the potential of smart contracts, it is necessary to connect the contracts with the outside world, such that they can understand and use information from other infrastructures. For instance, smart contracts would greatly benefit when they have access to web content. However, there are many challenges associated with realizing such a system, and despite the existence of many proposals, no solution is secure, provides easily-parsable data, introduces small overheads, and is easy to deploy. In this paper we propose PDFS, a practical system for data feeds that combines the advantages of the previous schemes and introduces new functionalities. PDFS extends content providers by including new features for data transparency and consistency validations. This combination provides multiple benefits like content which is easy to parse and efficient authenticity verification without breaking natural trust chains. PDFS keeps content providers auditable, mitigates their malicious activities (like data modification or censorship), and allows them to create a new business model. We show how PDFS is integrated with existing web services, report on a PDFS implementation and present results from conducted case studies and experiments.",

Some approaches have been proposed to automatically detect such \"fake\" news based on their content, but it is difficult to agree on universal criteria of authenticity (which can be bypassed by adversaries once known). Besides, it is obviously impossible to have each news item checked by a human. In this paper, we a mechanism to limit the spread of fake news which is not based on content. It can be implemented as a plugin on a social media platform. The principle is as follows: a team of fact-checkers reviews a small number of news items (the most popular ones), which enables to have an estimation of each user's inclination to share fake news items. Then, using a Bayesian approach, we estimate the trustworthiness of future news items, and treat accordingly those of them that pass a certain \"untrustworthiness\" threshold. We then evaluate the effectiveness and overhead of this technique on a large Twitter graph. We show that having a few thousands users exposed to one given news item enables to reach a very precise estimation of its reliability. We thus identify more than 99% of fake news items with no false positives. The performance impact is very small: the induced overhead on the 90th percentile latency is less than 3%, and less than 8% on the throughput of user operations.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes the first, known to us, open source presentation attack detection (PAD) solution to distinguish between authentic iris images (possibly wearing clear contact lenses) and irises with textured contact lenses. This software can serve as a baseline in various PAD evaluations, and also as an open-source platform with an up-to-date reference method for iris PAD. The software is written in C++ and Python and uses only open source resources, such as OpenCV. This method does not incorporate iris image segmentation, which may be problematic for unknown fake samples. Instead, it makes a best guess to localize the rough position of the iris. The PAD-related features are extracted with the Binary Statistical Image Features (BSIF), which are classified by an ensemble of classifiers incorporating support vector machine, random forest and multilayer perceptron. The models attached to the current software have been trained with the NDCLD'15 database and evaluated on the independent datasets included in the LivDet-Iris 2017 competition. The software implements the functionality of retraining the classifiers with any database of authentic and attack images. The accuracy of the current version offered with this paper exceeds 99% when tested on subject-disjoint subsets of NDCLD'15, and oscillates around 85% when tested on the LivDet-Iris 2017 benchmarks, which is on par with the results obtained by the LivDet-Iris 2017 winner.",

    "abstract": "In Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) networks, smart meters should send fine-grained power consumption readings to electric utilities to perform real-time monitoring and energy management. However, these readings can leak sensitive information about consumers' activities. Various privacy-preserving schemes for collecting fine-grained readings have been proposed for AMI networks. These schemes aggregate individual readings and send an aggregated reading to the utility, but they extensively use asymmetric-key cryptography which involves large computation/communication overhead. Furthermore, they do not address End-to-End (E2E) data integrity, authenticity, and computing electricity bills based on dynamic prices. In this paper, we propose EPIC, an efficient and privacy-preserving data collection scheme with E2E data integrity verification for AMI networks. Using efficient cryptographic operations, each meter should send a masked reading to the utility such that all the masks are canceled after aggregating all meters' masked readings, and thus the utility can only obtain an aggregated reading to preserve consumers' privacy. The utility can verify the aggregated reading integrity without accessing the individual readings to preserve privacy. It can also identify the attackers and compute electricity bills efficiently by using the fine-grained readings without violating privacy. Furthermore, EPIC can resist collusion attacks in which the utility colludes with a relay node to extract the meters' readings. A formal proof, probabilistic analysis are used to evaluate the security of EPIC, and ns-3 is used to implement EPIC and evaluate the network performance. In addition, we compare EPIC to existing data collection schemes in terms of overhead and security/privacy features.",

    "abstract": "This article surveys blockchain-based approaches for several security services. These services include authentication, confidentiality, privacy, and access control list (ACL), data and resource provenance, and integrity assurance. All these services are critical for the current distributed applications, especially due to the large amount of data being processed over the networks and the use of cloud computing. Authentication ensures that the user is who he/she claims to be. Confidentiality guarantees that data cannot be read by unauthorized users. Privacy provides the users the ability to control who can access their data. Provenance allows an efficient tracking of the data and resources along with their ownership and utilization over the network. Integrity helps in verifying that the data has not been modified or altered. These services are currently managed by centralized controllers, for example, a certificate authority. Therefore, the services are prone to attacks on the centralized controller. On the other hand, blockchain is a secured and distributed ledger that can help resolve many of the problems with centralization. The objectives of this paper are to give insights on the use of security services for current applications, to highlight the state of the art techniques that are currently used to provide these services, to describe their challenges, and to discuss how the blockchain technology can resolve these challenges. Further, several blockchain-based approaches providing such security services are compared thoroughly. Challenges associated with using blockchain-based security services are also discussed to spur further research in this area.",

Inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, are often used to capture gait dynamics. These inertial sensors are commonly integrated into smartphones and are widely used by the average person, which makes gait data convenient and inexpensive to collect. In this paper, we study gait recognition using smartphones in the wild. In contrast to traditional methods, which often require a person to walk along a specified road and/or at a normal walking speed, the proposed method collects inertial gait data under unconstrained conditions without knowing when, where, and how the user walks. To obtain good person identification and authentication performance, deep-learning techniques are presented to learn and model the gait biometrics based on walking data. Specifically, a hybrid deep neural network is proposed for robust gait feature representation, where features in the space and time domains are successively abstracted by a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network. In the experiments, two datasets collected by smartphones for a total of 118 subjects are used for evaluations. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves higher than 93.5\\% and 93.7\\% accuracies in person identification and authentication, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Gait as a biometric trait has attracted much attention in many security and privacy applications such as identity recognition and authentication, during the last few decades. Because of its nature as a long-distance biometric trait, gait can be easily collected and used to identify individuals non-intrusively through CCTV cameras. However, it is very difficult to develop robust automated gait recognition systems, since gait may be affected by many covariate factors such as clothing, walking speed, camera view angle etc. Out of them, large view angle changes has been deemed as the most challenging factor as it can alter the overall gait appearance substantially. Existing works on gait recognition are far from enough to provide satisfying performances because of such view changes. Furthermore, very few works have considered evidences -- the demonstrable information revealing the reliabilities of decisions, which are regarded as important demands in machine learning-based recognition/authentication applications. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a Discriminant Gait Generative Adversarial Network, namely DiGGAN, which can effectively extract view-invariant features for cross-view gait recognition; and more importantly, to transfer gait images to different views -- serving as evidences and showing how the decisions have been made. Quantitative experiments have been conducted on the two most popular cross-view gait datasets, the OU-MVLP and CASIA-B, where the proposed DiGGAN has outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative analysis has also been provided and demonstrates the proposed DiGGAN's capability in providing evidences.",

    "abstract": "The online social networks facilitate naturally for the users to share information. On these platforms, each user shares information based on his or her interests. The particular information being shared by a user may be legitimate or fake. Sometimes a misinformation, propagated by users and group can create chaos or in some cases, might leads to cases of riots. Nowadays the third party like ALT news and Cobrapost check the information authenticity, but it takes too much time to validate the news. Therefore, a robust and new system is required to check the information authenticity within the network, to stop the propagation of misinformation. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based framework for sharing the information securely at the peer level. In the blockchain model, a chain is created by combining blocks of information. Each node of network propagates the information based on its credibility to its peer nodes. The credibility of a node will vary according to the respective information. Trust is calculated between sender and receiver in two ways:(i) Local trust used for sharing information at the peer level and (ii) global trust is used for a credibility check of each user in the network. We evaluate our framework using real dataset derived from Facebook. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 83% which shows the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Due to the publicly known and deterministic characteristic of pilot tones, pilot authentication (PA) in multi-user multi-antenna orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems is very susceptible to the jamming/nulling/spoofing behaviors. To solve this, in this paper, we develop a hierarchical 2-D feature (H2DF) coding theory that exploits the hidden pilot signal features, i.e., the energy feature and independence feature, to secure pilot information coding which is applied between legitimate parties through a well-designed five-layer hierarchical coding model to achieve secure multiuser PA (SMPA). The reliability of SMPA is characterized using the identification error probability (IEP) of pilot encoding and decoding with the exact closed-form upper and lower bounds. However, this phenomenon of non-tight bounds brings about the risk of long-term instability in SMPA. Therefore, a reliability bound contraction theory is developed to shrink the bound interval, and practically, this is done by an easy-to-implement technique, namely, codebook partition within the H2DF code. In this process, a tradeoff between the upper and lower bounds of IEP is identified and a problem of optimal upper and lower bound tradeoff is formulated, with the objective of optimizing the cardinality of sub-codebooks such that the upper and lower bounds coincide. Solving this, we finally derive an exact closed-form expression for IEP, which realizes a stable and highly reliable SMPA. Numerical results validate the stability and resilience of H2DF coding in SMPA.",

Recent research utilizes the rich sensing capabilities of smart devices to build security schemes operating without human interaction, such as zero-interaction pairing (ZIP) and zero-interaction authentication (ZIA). Prior work proposed a number of ZIP and ZIA schemes and reported promising results. However, those schemes were often evaluated under conditions which do not reflect realistic IoT scenarios. In addition, drawing any comparison among the existing schemes is impossible due to the lack of a common public dataset and unavailability of scheme implementations. In this paper, we address these challenges by conducting the first large-scale comparative study of ZIP and ZIA schemes, carried out under realistic conditions. We collect and release the most comprehensive dataset in the domain to date, containing over 4250 hours of audio recordings and 1 billion sensor readings from three different scenarios, and evaluate five state-of-the-art schemes based on these data. Our study reveals that the effectiveness of the existing proposals is highly dependent on the scenario they are used in. In particular, we show that these schemes are subject to error rates between 0.6% and 52.8%.",

Thus, the convectional channel training protocol using pilot tones could be attacked and paralyzed, which raises the issue of anti-attack channel training authentication (CTA), i.e., verifying the claims of identities of pilot tones and channel estimation samples. In this paper, we consider one-ring scattering scenarios with large-scale uniform linear arrays (ULA) and develop an independence-checking coding (ICC) theory to build a secure and stable CTA protocol, namely, ICC-based CTA (ICC-CTA) protocol. In this protocol, the pilot tones are not only merely randomized and inserted into subcarriers but also encoded as diversified subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs) simultaneously. Those encoded SAPs, though camouflaged by malicious signals, can be identified and decoded into original pilots for high-accuracy channel impulse response (CIR) estimation. The CTA security is first characterized by the error probability of identifying legitimate CIR estimation samples. The CTA instability is formulated as the function of probability of stably estimating CIR against all available diversified SAPs. A realistic tradeoff between the CTA security and instability under the discretely distributed AoA is identified and an optimally stable tradeoff problem is formulated, with the objective of optimizing the code rate to maximize security while maintaining maximum stability for ever. Solving this, we derive the closed-form expression of optimal code rate. Numerical results finally validate the resilience of proposed ICC-CTA protocol.",

We use a set of images from several recorded events such as storms, marathons, protests, and other large public gatherings. Two strategies of applying pre-trained Imagenet network for event verification are presented, with two modifications for each strategy. The first method uses the features from the last convolutional layer of a pre-trained network as input to a classifier. We also consider the effects of tuning the convolutional weights of the pre-trained network to improve classification. The second method combines many features extracted from smaller scales and uses the output of a pre-trained network as the input to a second classifier. For both methods, we investigated several different classifiers and tested many different pre-trained networks. Our experiments demonstrate both these approaches are effective for event verification and image re-purposing detection. The classification at the global scale tends to marginally outperform our tested local methods and fine tuning the network further improves the results.",

In such a ubiquitous computing environment, customers release different computing or sensing tasks, and people, also known as data processors, participate in these tasks and get paid for providing their idle computing and communication resources. Thus, how to select an appropriate and reliable customer while not disclosing processors' privacy has become an interesting problem. In this article, we present a trust-based and privacy-preserving customer selection scheme in ubiquitous computing, called TPCS, to enable potential processors select the customers with good reputation. The basic concept of TPCS is that each data processor holds a trust value, and the reputation score of the customer is calculated based on processors' trust values and feedbacks via a truth discovery process. To preserve processors' privacy, pseudonyms and Paillier cryptosystem are applied to conceal each processor's real identity. In addition, three authentication protocols are designed to ensure that only the valid data processors (i.e., the processors registering in the system, holding the truthful trust values, and joining the computing tasks) can pass the authentication. A comprehensive security analysis is conducted to prove that our proposed TPCS scheme is secure and can defend against several sophisticated attacks. Moreover, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

The design of TouchAuth is based on the electrostatics of iBEP generation and a resulting property, i.e., the iBEPs at two close locations on the same human body are similar, whereas those from different human bodies are distinct. Extensive experiments verify the above property and show that TouchAuth achieves high-profile receiver operating characteristics in implementing the touch-to-access policy. Our experiments also show that a range of possible interfering sources including appliances' electromagnetic emanations and noise injections into the power network do not affect the performance of TouchAuth. A key advantage of TouchAuth is that the iBEP sensing requires a simple analog-to-digital converter only, which is widely available on microcontrollers. Compared with existing approaches including intra-body communication and physiological sensing, TouchAuth is a low-cost, lightweight, and convenient approach for authorized users to access the smart objects found in indoor environments.",

    "abstract": "In identity misbinding attacks against authenticated key-exchange protocols, a legitimate but compromised participant manipulates the honest parties so that the victim becomes unknowingly associated with a third party. These attacks are well known, and resistance to misbinding is considered a critical requirement for security protocols on the Internet. In the context of device pairing, on the other hand, the attack has received little attention outside the trusted-computing community. This paper points out that most device pairing protocols are vulnerable to misbinding. Device pairing protocols are characterized by lack of a-priory information, such as identifiers and cryptographic roots of trust, about the other endpoint. Therefore, the devices in pairing protocols need to be identified by the user's physical access to them. As case studies for demonstrating the misbinding vulnerability, we use Bluetooth and a protocol that registers new IoT devices to authentication servers on wireless networks. We have implemented the attacks. We also show how the attacks can be found in formal models of the protocols with carefully formulated correspondence assertions. The formal analysis yields a new type of double misbinding attack. While pairing protocols have been extensively modelled and analyzed, misbinding seems to be an aspect that has not previously received sufficient attention. Finally, we discuss potential ways to mitigate the threat and its significance to security of pairing protocols.",

    "abstract": "Authentication is vital for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications involving sensitive data (e.g., medical and financial systems). Digital signatures offer scalable authentication with non-repudiation and public verifiability, which are necessary for auditing and dispute resolution in such IoT applications. However, digital signatures have been shown to be highly costly for low-end IoT devices, especially when embedded devices (e.g., medical implants) must operate without a battery replacement for a long time. We propose an Energy-aware Signature for Embedded Medical devices (ESEM) that achieves near-optimal signer efficiency. ESEM signature generation does not require any costly operations (e.g., elliptic curve (EC) scalar multiplication/addition), but only a small constant-number of pseudo-random function calls, additions, and a single modular multiplication. ESEM has the smallest signature size among its EC-based counterparts with an identical private key size. We achieve this by eliminating the use of the ephemeral public key (i.e, commitment) in Schnorr-type signatures from the signing via a distributed construction at the verifier without interaction with the signer while permitting a constant-size public key. We proved that ESEM is secure (in random oracle model), and fully implemented it on an 8-bit AVR microcontroller that is commonly used in medical devices. Our experiments showed that ESEM achieves 8.4x higher energy efficiency over its closest counterpart while offering a smaller signature and code size. Hence, ESEM can be suitable for deployment on resource limited embedded devices in IoT. We open-sourced our software for public testing and wide-adoption.",

    "abstract": "Subspace clustering (SC) refers to the problem of clustering high-dimensional data into a union of low-dimensional subspaces. Based on spectral clustering, state-of-the-art approaches solve SC problem within a two-stage framework. In the first stage, data representation techniques are applied to draw an affinity matrix from the original data. In the second stage, spectral clustering is directly applied to the affinity matrix so that data can be grouped into different subspaces. However, the affinity matrix obtained in the first stage usually fails to reveal the authentic relationship between data points, which leads to inaccurate clustering results. In this paper, we propose a universal Three-Stage Subspace Clustering framework (3S-SC). Graph-Based Transformation and Optimization (GBTO) is added between data representation and spectral clustering. The affinity matrix is obtained in the first stage, then it goes through the second stage, where the proposed GBTO is applied to generate a reconstructed affinity matrix with more authentic similarity between data points. Spectral clustering is applied after GBTO, which is the third stage. We verify our 3S-SC framework with GBTO through theoretical analysis. Experiments on both synthetic data and the real-world data sets of handwritten digits and human faces demonstrate the universality of the proposed 3S-SC framework in improving the connectivity and accuracy of SC methods based on $\\ell_0$, $\\ell_1$, $\\ell_2$ or nuclear norm regularization.",

    "abstract": "The existing automatic fingerprint verification methods are designed to work under the assumption that the same sensor is installed for enrollment and authentication (regular matching). There is a remarkable decrease in efficiency when one type of contact-based sensor is employed for enrolment and another type of contact-based sensor is used for authentication (cross-matching or fingerprint sensor interoperability problem,). The ridge orientation patterns in a fingerprint are invariant to sensor type. Based on this observation, we propose a robust fingerprint descriptor called the co-occurrence of ridge orientations (Co-Ror), which encodes the spatial distribution of ridge orientations. Employing this descriptor, we introduce an efficient automatic fingerprint verification method for cross-matching problem. Further, to enhance the robustness of the method, we incorporate scale based ridge orientation information through Gabor-HoG descriptor. The two descriptors are fused with canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and the matching score between two fingerprints is calculated using city-block distance. The proposed method is alignment-free and can handle the matching process without the need for a registration step. The intensive experiments on two benchmark databases (FingerPass and MOLF) show the effectiveness of the method and reveal its significant enhancement over the state-of-the-art methods such as VeriFinger (a commercial SDK), minutia cylinder-code (MCC), MCC with scale, and the thin-plate spline (TPS) model. The proposed research will help security agencies, service providers and law-enforcement departments to overcome the interoperability problem of contact sensors of different technology and interaction types.",

    "abstract": "Password authentication suffers from the well-known tradeoff between security and usability. Secure passwords are difficult for users to remember, and memorable passwords are often easy to guess. SPARse Two-dimensional AuthenticatioN (SPARTAN) allows users to input their textual passwords in a two-dimensional grid instead of a linear textbox. This interface enables relatively short passwords to have a higher calculated level of security due to the need for an attacker to determine both the text of the password and the location of each character in the grid. We created a SPARTAN prototype and conducted a preliminary user study to evaluate the actual usability and security of the SPARTAN interface compared to the linear password entry interface. We find that while user-created SPARTAN passwords tend to be shorter than their linear counterparts, the calculated security of user-created SPARTAN passwords is higher than that of user-created linear passwords. We also asked participants to complete a survey on the usability of the SPARTAN interface and identified some areas of improvement, while prototype interaction provided evidence of users becoming more familiar with SPARTAN over time. Finally, we performed an investigation into password-cracking tools, and assert that SPARTAN passwords require more resources to crack than their linear counterparts. These findings suggest that SPARTAN is a promising alternative to linear passwords from a security standpoint. Usability of the interface and memorability of SPARTAN passwords is an interesting research question and should be further investigated in future work.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), vehicular networks and cyber-physical systems, the need for real-time data processing and analysis has emerged as an essential pre-requite for customers' satisfaction. In this direction, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) provides seamless services with reduced latency, enhanced mobility, and improved location awareness. Since MEC has evolved from Cloud Computing, it inherited numerous security and privacy issues from the latter. Further, decentralized architectures and diversified deployment environments used in MEC platforms also aggravate the problem; causing great concerns for the research fraternity. Thus, in this paper, we propose an efficient and lightweight mutual authentication protocol for MEC environments; based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), one-way hash functions and concatenation operations. The designed protocol also leverages the advantages of discrete logarithm problems, computational Diffie-Hellman, random numbers and time-stamps to resist various attacks namely-impersonation attacks, replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, etc. The paper also presents a comparative assessment of the proposed scheme relative to the current state-of-the-art schemes. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed scheme incurs relatively less communication and computational overheads, and is appropriate to be adopted in resource constraint MEC environments.",

    "abstract": "The benefits of the ubiquitous caching in ICN are profound, such features make ICN promising for content distribution, but it also introduces a challenge to content protection against the unauthorized access. The protection of a content against unauthorized access requires consumer authentication and involves the conventional end-to-end encryption. However, in information-centric networking (ICN), such end-to-end encryption makes the content caching ineffective since encrypted contents stored in a cache are useless for any consumers except those who know the encryption key. For effective caching of encrypted contents in ICN, we propose a secure distribution of protected content (SDPC) scheme, which ensures that only authenticated consumers can access the content. SDPC is lightweight and allows consumers to verify the originality of the published content by using a symmetric key encryption. Moreover, SDPC naming scheme provides protection against privacy leakage. The security of SDPC was proved with the BAN logic and Scyther tool verification, and simulation results show that SDPC can reduce the content download delay.",

While much attention has been given to IoT security such as the use of TLS to secure sensed data, little thought has been given to securing the calibration infrastructure itself. Currently traceability is achieved via manual verification using paper-based datasheets which is both time consuming and insecure. For instance, when the calibration status of parent devices is revoked as mistakes or mischance is detected, calibrated devices are not updated until the next calibration cycle, leaving much of the calibration parameters invalid. Aside from error, any party within the calibration infrastructure can maliciously introduce errors since the current paper based system lacks authentication as well as non-repudiation. In this paper, we propose a novel resilient architecture for calibration infrastructure, where the calibration status of sensor elements can be verified on-the-fly to the root of trust preserving the properties of authentication and non-repudiation. We propose an implementation based on smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Our evaluation shows that Ethereum is likely to address the protection requirements of traceable measurements.",

Ensuring the security of IoT devices is a high priority due to the sensitive nature of the collected data. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have emerged as critical hardware primitive for ensuring the security of IoT nodes. Malicious modeling of PUF architectures has proven to be difficult due to the inherently stochastic nature of PUF architectures. Extant approaches to malicious PUF modeling assume that a priori knowledge and physical access to the PUF architecture is available for malicious attack on the IoT node. However, many IoT networks make the underlying assumption that the PUF architecture is sufficiently tamper-proof, both physically and mathematically. In this work, we show that knowledge of the underlying PUF structure is not necessary to clone a PUF. We present a novel non-invasive, architecture independent, machine learning attack for strong PUF designs with a cloning accuracy of 93.5% and improvements of up to 48.31% over an alternative, two-stage brute force attack model. We also propose a machine-learning based countermeasure, discriminator, which can distinguish cloned PUF devices and authentic PUFs with an average accuracy of 96.01%. The proposed discriminator can be used for rapidly authenticating millions of IoT nodes remotely from the cloud server.",

    "abstract": "Authenticated lateral movement via compromised accounts is a common adversarial maneuver that is challenging to discover with signature- or rules-based intrusion detection systems. In this work a behavior-based approach to detecting malicious logins to novel systems indicative of lateral movement is presented, in which a user's historical login activity is used to build a model of putative \"normal\" behavior. This historical login activity is represented as a collection of daily login graphs, which encode authentications among accessed systems. Each system, or graph vertex, is described by a set of graph centrality measures that characterize it and the local topology of its login graph. The unsupervised technique of non-negative matrix factorization is then applied to this set of features to assign each vertex to a role that summarizes how the system participates in logins. The reconstruction error quantifying how well each vertex fits into its role is then computed, and the statistics of this error can be used to identify outlier vertices that correspond to systems involved in unusual logins. We test this technique with a small cohort of privileged accounts using real login data from an operational enterprise network. The ability of the method to identify malicious logins among normal activity is tested with simulated graphs of login activity representative of adversarial lateral movement. We find that the method is generally successful at detecting a broad range of lateral movement for each user, with false positive rates significantly lower than those resulting from alerts based solely on login novelty.",

In this paper, we first create a de-raining quality assessment (DQA) database that collects 206 authentic rain images and their de-rained versions produced by 6 representative single image rain removal algorithms. Then, a subjective study is conducted on our DQA database, which collects the subject-rated scores of all de-rained images. To quantitatively measure the quality of de-rained image with non-uniform artifacts, we propose a bi-directional feature embedding network (B-FEN) which integrates the features of global perception and local difference together. Experiments confirm that the proposed method significantly outperforms many existing universal blind image quality assessment models. To help the research towards perceptually preferred de-raining algorithm, we will publicly release our DQA database and B-FEN source code on https://github.com/wqb-uestc.",

Theoretically, these needs could be efficiently fulfilled adopting specific kinds of indexing, which however are normally ruled-out in DBMSes design. We introduce the concept of overlay index: an index that is meant to be stored in a standard database, alongside regular data and managed by regular software, to complement DBMS capabilities. We show a data structure, that we call DB-tree, that realizes an overlay index to support a wide range of custom aggregate range queries as well as ADSes, efficiently. All DB-trees operations can be performed by executing a small number of queries to the DBMS, that can be issued in parallel in one or two query rounds, and involves a logarithmic amount of data. We experimentally evaluate the efficiency of DB-trees showing that our approach is effective, especially if data updates are limited.",

Users run DeepWiFi for i) RF front end processing; ii) spectrum sensing and signal classification; iii) signal authentication; iv) channel selection and access; v) power control; vi) modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptation; and vii) routing. DeepWiFi mitigates the effects of probabilistic, sensing-based, and adaptive jammers. RF front end processing applies a deep learning-based autoencoder to extract spectrum-representative features. Then a deep neural network is trained to classify waveforms reliably as idle, WiFi, or jammer. Utilizing channel labels, users effectively access idle or jammed channels, while avoiding interference with legitimate WiFi transmissions (authenticated by machine learning-based RF fingerprinting) resulting in higher throughput. Users optimize their transmit power for low probability of intercept/detection and their MCS to maximize link rates used by backpressure algorithm for routing. Supported by embedded platform implementation, DeepWiFi provides major throughput gains compared to baseline WiFi and another jamming-resistant protocol, especially when channels are likely to be jammed and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio is low.",

Past research on facial emotion recognition focuses on the laboratory environment. However, it faces many challenges in real-world conditions, i.e., illumination changes, large pose variations and partial or full occlusions. Those challenges lead to different face areas with different degrees of sharpness and completeness. Inspired by this fact, we focus on the authenticity of predictions generated by different <emotion, region> pairs. For example, if only the mouth areas are available and the emotion classifier predicts happiness, then there is a question of how to judge the authenticity of predictions. This problem can be converted into the contribution of different face areas to different emotions. In this paper, we divide the whole face into six areas: nose areas, mouth areas, eyes areas, nose to mouth areas, nose to eyes areas and mouth to eyes areas. To obtain more convincing results, our experiments are conducted on three different databases: facial expression recognition + ( FER+), real-world affective faces database (RAF-DB) and expression in-the-wild (ExpW) dataset. Through analysis of the classification accuracy, the confusion matrix and the class activation map (CAM), we can establish convincing results. To sum up, the contributions of this paper lie in two areas: 1) We visualize concerned areas of human faces in emotion recognition; 2) We analyze the contribution of different face areas to different emotions in real-world conditions through experimental analysis. Our findings can be combined with findings in psychology to promote the understanding of emotional expressions.",

The reason for this is that while the means and tools to support password attacks are becoming more and more abundant, the number of transaction systems through the Internet is increasing, and new services systems appear. For example, IoT also uses password-based authentication. In this context, consolidating password-based authentication mechanisms is critical, but monitoring measures for timely detection of attacks also play an important role in this battle. The password attack detection solutions being used need to be supplemented and improved to meet the new situation. In this paper we propose a solution that automatically detects online password attacks in a way that is based solely on the network, using unsupervised learning techniques and protected application orientation. Our solution, therefore, minimizes dependence on the factors encountered by host-based or supervised learning solutions. The certainty of the solution comes from using the results of an in-depth analysis of attack characteristics to build the detection capacity of the mechanism. The solution was implemented experimentally on the real system and gave positive results.",

Face anti-spoofing is a measure towards this direction for bio-metric user authentication, and in particular face recognition, that tries to prevent spoof attacks. The state-of-the-art anti-spoofing techniques leverage the ability of deep neural networks to learn discriminative features, based on cues from the training set images or video samples, in an effort to detect spoof attacks. However, due to the particular nature of the problem, i.e. large variability due to factors like different backgrounds, lighting conditions, camera resolutions, spoof materials, etc., these techniques typically fail to generalize to new samples. In this paper, we explicitly tackle this problem and propose a class-conditional domain discriminator module, that, coupled with a gradient reversal layer, tries to generate live and spoof features that are discriminative, but at the same time robust against the aforementioned variability factors. Extensive experimental analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing image- and video-based anti-spoofing techniques, both in terms of numerical improvement as well as when visualizing the learned features.",

    "abstract": "We assess the security of machine learning based biometric authentication systems against an attacker who submits uniform random inputs, either as feature vectors or raw inputs, in order to find an accepting sample of a target user. The average false positive rate (FPR) of the system, i.e., the rate at which an impostor is incorrectly accepted as the legitimate user, may be interpreted as a measure of the success probability of such an attack. However, we show that the success rate is often higher than the FPR. In particular, for one reconstructed biometric system with an average FPR of 0.03, the success rate was as high as 0.78. This has implications for the security of the system, as an attacker with only the knowledge of the length of the feature space can impersonate the user with less than 2 attempts on average. We provide detailed analysis of why the attack is successful, and validate our results using four different biometric modalities and four different machine learning classifiers. Finally, we propose mitigation techniques that render such attacks ineffective, with little to no effect on the accuracy of the system.",

    "abstract": "The popularity of smart-home assistant systems such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home leads to a booming third-party application market (over 70,000 applications across the two stores). While existing works have revealed security issues in these systems, it is not well understood how to help application developers to enforce security requirements. In this paper, we perform a preliminary case study to examine the security vetting mechanisms adopted by Amazon Alexa and Google Home app stores. With a focus on the authentication mechanisms between Alexa/Google cloud and third-party application servers (i.e. endpoints), we show the current security vetting is insufficient as developer mistakes can not be effectively detected and notified. A weak authentication would allow attackers to spoof the cloud to insert/retrieve data into/from the application endpoints. We validate the attack through ethical proof-of-concept experiments. To confirm vulnerable applications have indeed passed the security vetting and entered the markets, we develop a heuristic-based searching method. We find 219 real-world Alexa endpoints that carry the vulnerability, many of which are related to critical applications that control smart home devices and electronic cars. We have notified Amazon and Google about our findings and offered our suggestions to mitigate the issue.",

Because of wide openness, relatively high processing power, and wide distribution of IoT things, they are ideal for attacks of the gray hole. In the gray hole attack, the attacker fakes itself as the shortest path to the destination that is a thing here. This causes the routing packets not to reach the destination. The proposed method is based on the AODV routing protocol and is presented under the MTISS-IoT name which means for the reduction of gray hole attacks using check node information. In this paper, a hybrid approach is proposed based on cryptographic authentication. The proposed approach consists of four phases, such as the verifying node trust in the IoT, testing the routes, gray hole attack discovery, and the malicious attack elimination process in MTISS-IoT. The method is evaluated here via extensive simulations carried out in the NS-3 environment. The experimental results of four scenarios demonstrated that the MTISS-IoT method can achieve a false positive rate of 14.104%, a false negative rate of 17.49%, and a detection rate of 94.5% when gray hole attack was launched.",

Those recourse constrained devices are connected to create real-time distributed networks popularly known as the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing and edge computing. The blockchain is gaining a lot of interest in these domains to secure the system by ignoring centralized dependencies, where proof-of-work (PoW) plays a vital role to make the whole security solution decentralized. Due to the resource limitations of the devices, PoW is not suitable for blockchain-based security solutions. This paper presents a novel consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Authentication (PoAh), which introduces a cryptographic authentication mechanism to replace PoW for resource constrained devices, and to make the blockchain application-specific. PoAh is thus suitable for private as well as permissioned blockchains. Further, PoAh not only secures the systems, but also maintains system sustainability and scalability. The proposed consensus algorithm is evaluated theoretically in simulation scenarios, and in real-time hardware testbeds to validate its performance. Finally, PoAh and its integration with the blockchain in the IoT and edge computing scenarios is discussed. The proposed PoAh, while running in limited computer resources (e.g. single-board computing devices like the Raspberry Pi) has a latency in the order of 3 secs.",

Autonomous vehicular network (AVNET), as one of the most promising applications of MEC, can feature edge learning and communication techniques, improving the safety for autonomous vehicles (AVs). This paper focuses on the edge learning in AVNET, where AVs at the edge of the network share model parameters instead of data in a distributed manner, and an aggregator (e.g., a base station) aggregates parameters from AVs and at the end obtains a trained model. Despite promising, security issues, such as data leakage, computing integrity invasion and fault connection in existing edge learning cases are not considered fully. To the best of our knowledge, there lacks an effective scheme simultaneously covering the foregoing security issues. Therefore, we propose \\textit{SecEL}, a privacy-preserving, verifiable and fault-tolerant scheme for edge learning in AVNET. First, we leverage the primitive of bivariate polynomial-based secret sharing to encrypt model parameters by one-time padding. Second, we use homomorphic authenticator based on message authentication code to support verifiable computation. Third, we mitigate the computation failure problem caused by fault connection. Last, we simulate and evaluate SecEL in terms of time cost, throughput and classification accuracy. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of SecEL.",

This database contains more than 64K on-line character samples performed by 217 users, with 94 different smartphone models, and up to 6 acquisition sessions. ii) We perform a complete analysis of the proposed approach considering both traditional authentication systems such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and novel approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In addition, we present a novel approach named Time-Aligned Recurrent Neural Networks (TA-RNNs). This approach combines the potential of DTW and RNNs to train more robust systems against attacks. A complete analysis of the proposed approach is carried out using both MobileTouchDB and e-BioDigitDB databases. Our proposed TA-RNN system outperforms the state of the art, achieving a final 2.38% Equal Error Rate, using just a 4-digit password and one training sample per character.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) is a trending topic in the computing world. Notably, IoT devices have strict design requirements and are often referred to as constrained devices. Therefore, security techniques and primitives that are lightweight are more suitable for such devices, e.g., Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). SRAM PUF is an intrinsic security primitive that is seeing widespread adoption in the IoT segment. ECC is a public-key algorithm technique that has been gaining popularity among constrained IoT devices. The popularity is due to using significantly smaller operands when compared to other public-key techniques such as RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman). This paper shows the design, development, and evaluation of an application-specific secure communication architecture based on SRAM PUF technology and ECC for constrained IoT devices. More specifically, it introduces an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) public-key based cryptographic protocol that utilizes PUF-derived keys as the root-of-trust for silicon authentication. Also, it proposes a design of a modular hardware architecture that supports the protocol. Finally, to analyze the practicality as well as the feasibility of the proposed protocol, we demonstrate the solution by prototyping and verifying a protocol variant on the commercial Xilinx Zynq-7000 APSoC device.",

This paper proposes a Copy and Paste Generative Adversarial Network (CPGAN) to recover authentic high-resolution (HR) face images while compensating for low and non-uniform illumination. To this end, we develop two key components in our CPGAN: internal and external Copy and Paste nets (CPnets). Specifically, our internal CPnet exploits facial information residing in the input image to enhance facial details; while our external CPnet leverages an external HR face for illumination compensation. A new illumination compensation loss is thus developed to capture illumination from the external guided face image effectively. Furthermore, our method offsets illumination and upsamples facial details alternately in a coarse-to-fine fashion, thus alleviating the correspondence ambiguity between LR inputs and external HR inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method manifests authentic HR face images in a uniform illumination condition and outperforms state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.",

When a driver with a key fob is in the vicinity of the vehicle, doors automatically unlock on user command. However, unfortunately, it has been shown that these keyless entry systems are vulnerable to signal relaying attacks. While it is evident that automobile manufacturers incorporate preventative methods to secure these keyless entry systems, they continue to be vulnerable to a range of attacks. Relayed signals result in valid packets that are verified as legitimate, and this makes it is difficult to distinguish a legitimate door unlock request from a malicious signal. In response to this vulnerability, this paper presents an RF fingerprinting method (coined HOld the DOoR, HODOR) to detect attacks on keyless entry systems the first attempt to exploit the RF fingerprint technique in the automotive domain. HODOR is designed as a sub authentication method that supports existing authentication systems for keyless entry systems and does not require any modification of the main system to perform. Through a series of experiments, the results demonstrate that HODOR competently and reliably detects attacks on keyless entry systems. HODOR achieves both an average false positive rate (FPR) of 0.27 percent with a false negative rate (FNR) of 0 percent for the detection of simulated attacks, corresponding to current research on keyless entry car theft.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the bloom development of the human-centered wireless sensing applications, in which some human information, such as the user's identity and motions, can be retrieved through analyzing the signal distortion caused by the target person. However, the openness of wireless transmission raises increasing concerns on user privacy, since either the human identity or human motion is sensitive in certain scenarios, including personal residence, laboratory, and office. Researchers have reported that commodity WiFi signals can be abused to identify users. To dispel this threat, in this paper we propose a privacy-preserving framework to effectively hide the information of user behaviors in wireless signals while retaining the ability of user authentication. The core of our framework is a novel Siamese network-based deep model, namely RFBP-Net. In this way, wireless sensing reveals user information moderately. We conduct extensive experiments on both the real WiFi and RFID system and open datasets. The experiment results show that RFBP-Net is able to significantly reduce the activity recognition accuracy, i.e., 70% reduction in the RFID system and 80% reduction in the WiFi system, with a slight penalty in the user authentication accuracy, i.e., only 5% and 1% decrease in the RFID and WiFi system, respectively.",

Although access to unauthorized persons can be prevented through cryptography, it cannot be simultaneously used for copyright protection or content authentication with the preservation of image integrity. Hence, this paper presents an optimized multipurpose blind watermarking in Shearlet domain with the help of smart algorithms including MLP and NSGA-II. In this method, four copies of the robust copyright logo are embedded in the approximate coefficients of Shearlet by using an effective quantization technique. Furthermore, an embedded random sequence as a semi-fragile authentication mark is effectively extracted from details by the neural network. Due to performing an effective optimization algorithm for selecting optimum embedding thresholds, and also distinguishing the texture of blocks, the imperceptibility and robustness have been preserved. The experimental results reveal the superiority of the scheme with regard to the quality of watermarked images and robustness against hybrid attacks over other state-of-the-art schemes. The average PSNR and SSIM of the dual watermarked images are 38 dB and 0.95, respectively; Besides, it can effectively extract the copyright logo and locates forgery regions under severe attacks with satisfactory accuracy.",

Our system can detect overshadowing attacks using a ternary decision function with a threshold. In our evaluation of this SDP scheme's security and robustness, we achieve a bit error ratio below 0.1% for a net bit rate of 100 bps with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 14 dB.

This is why we report in this paper the first known attempt to try to perform adversarial attack on voice conversion. We introduce human imperceptible noise into the utterances of a speaker whose voice is to be defended. Given these adversarial examples, voice conversion models cannot convert other utterances so as to sound like being produced by the defended speaker. Preliminary experiments were conducted on two currently state-of-the-art zero-shot voice conversion models. Objective and subjective evaluation results in both white-box and black-box scenarios are reported. It was shown that the speaker characteristics of the converted utterances were made obviously different from those of the defended speaker, while the adversarial examples of the defended speaker are not distinguishable from the authentic utterances.",

We introduce side-channel analysis with reinforcement learning (SCARL) capable of extracting data-dependent features of the measurements in an unsupervised learning approach without requiring a prior knowledge on the leakage model. SCARL consists of an auto-encoder to encode the information of power measurements into an internal representation, and a reinforcement learning algorithm to extract information about the secret data. We employ a reinforcement learning algorithm with actor-critic networks, to identify the proper leakage model that results in maximum inter-cluster separation of the auto-encoder representation. SCARL assumes that the lower order components of a generic non-linear leakage model have larger contribution to the leakage of sensitive data. On a lightweight implementation of the Ascon authenticated cipher on the Artix-7 FPGA, SCARL is able to recover the secret key using 24K power traces during the key insertion, or Initialization Stage, of the cipher. We also demonstrate that classical techniques such as DPA and CPA fail to identify the correct key using traditional linear leakage models and more than 40K power traces.",

Existing authentication schemes-based on digital signatures have overhead costs associated with them in terms of computation time, battery power, bandwidth, memory, and related hardware costs. Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF), utilizing the unique device-based information, can be a promising solution for IoT. However, traditional RFFs have become obsolete because of low reliability and reduced user capability. Our proposed solution, Metasurface RF-Fingerprinting Injection (MeRFFI), is to inject a carefully-designed radio frequency fingerprint into the wireless physical layer that can increase the security of a stationary IoT device with minimal overhead. The injection of fingerprint is implemented using a low cost metasurface developed and fabricated in our lab, which is designed to make small but detectable perturbations in the specific frequency band in which the IoT devices are communicating. We have conducted comprehensive system evaluations including distance, orientation, multiple channels where the feasibility, effectiveness, and reliability of these fingerprints are validated. The proposed MeRFFI system can be easily integrated into the existing authentication schemes.

    "abstract": "Recent work by Pijnenburg and Poettering (ESORICS'20) explores the novel cryptographic Encrypt-to-Self primitive that is dedicated to use cases of symmetric encryption where encryptor and decryptor coincide. The primitive is envisioned to be useful whenever a memory-bounded computing device is required to encrypt some data with the aim of temporarily depositing it on an untrusted storage device. While the new primitive protects the confidentiality of payloads as much as classic authenticated encryption primitives would do, it provides considerably better authenticity guarantees: Specifically, while classic solutions would completely fail in a context involving user corruptions, if an encrypt-to-self scheme is used to protect the data, all ciphertexts and messages fully remain unforgeable. To instantiate their encrypt-to-self primitive, Pijnenburg et al propose a mode of operation of the compression function of a hash function, with a carefully designed encoding function playing the central role in the serialization of the processed message and associated data. In the present work we revisit the design of this encoding function. Without questioning its adequacy for securely accomplishing the encrypt-to-self job, we improve on it from a technical/implementational perspective by proposing modifications that alleviate certain conditions that would inevitably require implementations to disrespect memory alignment restrictions imposed by the word-wise operation of modern CPUs, ultimately leading to performance penalties. Our main contributions are thus to propose an improved encoding function, to explain why it offers better performance, and to prove that it provides as much security as its predecessor. We finally report on our open-source implementation of the encrypt-to-self primitive based on the new encoding function.",

    "abstract": "We introduce password strength information signaling as a novel, yet counter-intuitive, defense against password cracking attacks. Recent breaches have exposed billions of user passwords to the dangerous threat of offline password cracking attacks. An offline attacker can quickly check millions (or sometimes billions/trillions) of password guesses by comparing their hash value with the stolen hash from a breached authentication server. The attacker is limited only by the resources he is willing to invest. Our key idea is to have the authentication server store a (noisy) signal about the strength of each user password for an offline attacker to find. Surprisingly, we show that the noise distribution for the signal can often be tuned so that a rational (profit-maximizing) attacker will crack {\\em fewer} passwords. The signaling scheme exploits the fact that password cracking is not a zero-sum game i.e., the attacker's profit is given by the value of the cracked passwords {\\em minus} the total guessing cost. Thus, a well-defined signaling strategy will encourage the attacker to reduce his guessing costs by cracking fewer passwords. We give a (heuristic) algorithm to compute the optimal signaling scheme for a defender. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our mechanism on several empirical password datasets and show that it can reduce the total number of cracked passwords by $\\approx 10\\%$ of all users.",

    "abstract": "Augmented and virtual reality is being deployed in different fields of applications. Such applications might involve accessing or processing critical and sensitive information, which requires strict and continuous access control. Given that Head-Mounted Displays (HMD) developed for such applications commonly contains internal cameras for gaze tracking purposes, we evaluate the suitability of such setup for verifying the users through iris recognition. In this work, we first evaluate a set of iris recognition algorithms suitable for HMD devices by investigating three well-established handcrafted feature extraction approaches, and to complement it, we also present the analysis using four deep learning models. While taking into consideration the minimalistic hardware requirements of stand-alone HMD, we employ and adapt a recently developed miniature segmentation model (EyeMMS) for segmenting the iris. Further, to account for non-ideal and non-collaborative capture of iris, we define a new iris quality metric that we termed as Iris Mask Ratio (IMR) to quantify the iris recognition performance. Motivated by the performance of iris recognition, we also propose the continuous authentication of users in a non-collaborative capture setting in HMD. Through the experiments on a publicly available OpenEDS dataset, we show that performance with EER = 5% can be achieved using deep learning methods in a general setting, along with high accuracy for continuous user authentication.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel solution for the cashier problem. Current cashier system/Point of Sale (POS) terminals can be inefficient, cumbersome and time-consuming for the users. There is a need for a solution dependent on modern technology and ubiquitous computing resources. We present I-POST (Intelligent Point of Sale and Transaction) as a software system that uses smart devices, mobile phone and state of the art machine learning algorithms to process the user transactions in automated and real time manner. I-POST is an automated checkout system that allows the user to walk in a store, collect his items and exit the store. There is no need to stand and wait in a queue. The system uses object detection and facial recognition algorithm to process the authentication of the client and the state of the object. At point of exit, the classifier sends the data to the backend server which execute the payments. The system uses Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for the image recognition and processing. CNN is a supervised learning model that has found major application in pattern recognition problem. The current implementation uses two classifiers that work intrinsically to authenticate the user and track the items. The model accuracy for object recognition is 97%, the loss is 9.3%. We expect that such systems can bring efficiency to the market and has the potential for broad and diverse applications.",

    "abstract": "ML-as-a-service (MLaaS) becomes increasingly popular and revolutionizes the lives of people. A natural requirement for MLaaS is, however, to provide highly accurate prediction services. To achieve this, current MLaaS systems integrate and combine multiple well-trained models in their services. However, in reality, there is no easy way for MLaaS providers, especially for startups, to collect well-trained models from individual developers, due to the lack of incentives. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by building a model marketplace, called as Golden Grain, to facilitate model sharing, which enforces the fair model-money swaps between individual developers and MLaaS providers. Specifically, we deploy the swapping process on the blockchain, and further introduce a blockchain-empowered model benchmarking design for transparently determining the model prices according to their authentic performances so as to incentivize the faithful contributions of well-trained models. Especially, to ease the blockchain overhead for benchmarking, our marketplace carefully offloads the heavy computation and crafts a trusted execution environment (TEE) based secure off-chain on-chain interaction protocol, ensuring both the integrity and authenticity of benchmarking. We implement a prototype of our Golden Grain on the Ethereum blockchain, and conduct extensive experiments with standard benchmark datasets to demonstrate the practically affordable performance of our design.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has questioned the fairness of face-based recognition and attribute classification methods (such as gender and race) for dark-skinned people and women. Ocular biometrics in the visible spectrum is an alternate solution over face biometrics, thanks to its accuracy, security, robustness against facial expression, and ease of use in mobile devices. With the recent COVID-19 crisis, ocular biometrics has a further advantage over face biometrics in the presence of a mask. However, fairness of ocular biometrics has not been studied till now. This first study aims to explore the fairness of ocular-based authentication and gender classification methods across males and females. To this aim, VISOB $2.0$ dataset, along with its gender annotations, is used for the fairness analysis of ocular biometrics methods based on ResNet-50, MobileNet-V2 and lightCNN-29 models. Experimental results suggest the equivalent performance of males and females for ocular-based mobile user-authentication in terms of genuine match rate (GMR) at lower false match rates (FMRs) and an overall Area Under Curve (AUC). For instance, an AUC of 0.96 for females and 0.95 for males was obtained for lightCNN-29 on an average. However, males significantly outperformed females in deep learning based gender classification models based on ocular-region.",

    "abstract": "In recent times researchers have found several security vulnerabilities in the Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy network (RPL), amongst which rank attack is a predominant one causing detrimental effects on the network by creating a fake topology. To address this concern, we propose a low-overhead rank attack detection scheme for non-storing mode of RPL used in IoT to deal with both increased and decreased rank attacks. Accordingly, we have modified the RPL Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) formation algorithm to detect rank attacks during topology formation and maintenance. The distributed module of the algorithm runs in all the participating nodes whereas the centralized module runs in the sink. Unlike many existing schemes, instead of sending additional control message, we make the scheme low-overhead by simply modifying the DAO control message. Additionally, a lightweight Message Authentication Code (HMAC-LOCHA) is used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the control messages exchanged between nodes and the sink. The correctness of the proposed scheme is established through a concrete proof using multiple test case scenarios. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated both theoretically and through simulation in Contiki-based Cooja simulator. Theoretical evaluation proves the energy efficiency of the scheme. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms over a state-of-the-art rank attack detection scheme in terms of detection accuracy, false positive or negative rate and energy consumption while also keeping acceptable network performance such as improved detection latency and at par packet delivery ratio.",

    "abstract": "As the Covid-19 pandemic grips the world, healthcare systems are being reshaped, where the e-health concepts become more likely to be accepted. Wearable devices often carry sensitive information from users which are exposed to security and privacy risks. Moreover, users have always had the concern of being counterfeited between the fabrication process and vendors' storage. Hence, not only securing personal data is becoming a crucial obligation, but also device verification is another challenge. To address biometrics authentication and physically unclonable functions (PUFs) need to be put in place to mitigate the security and privacy of the users. Among biometrics modalities, Electrocardiogram (ECG) based biometric has become popular as it can authenticate patients and monitor the patient's vital signs. However, researchers have recently started to study the vulnerabilities of the ECG biometric systems and tried to address the issues of spoofing. Moreover, most of the wearable is enabled with CPU and memories. Thus, volatile memory-based (NVM) PUF can be easily placed in the device to avoid counterfeit. However, many research challenged the unclonability characteristics of PUFs. Thus, a careful study on these attacks should be sufficient to address the need. In this paper, our aim is to provide a comprehensive study on the state-of-the-art developments papers based on biometrics enabled hardware security.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning provides automated means to capture complex dynamics of wireless spectrum and support better understanding of spectrum resources and their efficient utilization. As communication systems become smarter with cognitive radio capabilities empowered by machine learning to perform critical tasks such as spectrum awareness and spectrum sharing, they also become susceptible to new vulnerabilities due to the attacks that target the machine learning applications. This paper identifies the emerging attack surface of adversarial machine learning and corresponding attacks launched against wireless communications in the context of 5G systems. The focus is on attacks against (i) spectrum sharing of 5G communications with incumbent users such as in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band and (ii) physical layer authentication of 5G User Equipment (UE) to support network slicing. For the first attack, the adversary transmits during data transmission or spectrum sensing periods to manipulate the signal-level inputs to the deep learning classifier that is deployed at the Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) to support the 5G system. For the second attack, the adversary spoofs wireless signals with the generative adversarial network (GAN) to infiltrate the physical layer authentication mechanism based on a deep learning classifier that is deployed at the 5G base station. Results indicate major vulnerabilities of 5G systems to adversarial machine learning. To sustain the 5G system operations in the presence of adversaries, a defense mechanism is presented to increase the uncertainty of the adversary in training the surrogate model used for launching its subsequent attacks.",

With 5 gallery sequences and test sequences of length 50, TypeNet achieves state-of-the-art keystroke biometric authentication performance with an Equal Error Rate of 2.2% and 9.2% for physical and touchscreen keyboards, respectively, significantly outperforming previous approaches. Our experiments demonstrate a moderate increase in error with up to 100,000 subjects, demonstrating the potential of TypeNet to operate at an Internet scale. We utilize two Aalto University keystroke databases, one captured on physical keyboards and the second on mobile devices (touchscreen keyboards). To the best of our knowledge, both databases are the largest existing free-text keystroke databases available for research with more than 136 million keystrokes from 168,000 subjects in physical keyboards, and 60,000 subjects with more than 63 million keystrokes acquired on mobile touchscreens.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological advancements have enabled proliferated use of small embedded and IoT devices for collecting, processing, and transferring the security-critical information and user data. This exponential use has acted as a catalyst in the recent growth of sophisticated attacks such as the replay, man-in-the-middle, and malicious code modification to slink, leak, tweak or exploit the security-critical information in malevolent activities. Therefore, secure communication and software state assurance (at run-time and boot-time) of the device has emerged as open security problems. Furthermore, these devices need to have an appropriate recovery mechanism to bring them back to the known-good operational state. Previous researchers have demonstrated independent methods for attack detection and safeguard. However, the majority of them lack in providing onboard system recovery and secure communication techniques. To bridge this gap, this manuscript proposes SRACARE- a framework that utilizes the custom lightweight, secure communication protocol that performs remote/local attestation, and secure boot with an onboard resilience recovery mechanism to protect the devices from the above-mentioned attacks. The prototype employs an efficient lightweight, low-power 32-bit RISC-V processor, secure communication protocol, code authentication, and resilience engine running on the Artix 7 Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) board. This work presents the performance evaluation and state-of-the-art comparison results, which shows promising resilience to attacks and demonstrate the novel protection mechanism with onboard recovery. The framework achieves these with only 8 % performance overhead and a very small increase in hardware-software footprint.",

These resources are larger than can be marshalled at any one site within the community. Production reconstruction, analysis, and simulation will need to take maximum advantage of these distributed computing and storage resources using the new capabilities offered by the Grid computing paradigm. Since large-scale, coordinated Grid computing involves user access across many Regional Centers and national and funding boundaries, one of the most crucial aspects of Grid computing is that of user authentication and authorization. While projects such as the DOE Grids CA have gone a long way to solving the problem of distributed authentication, the authorization problem is still largely open. We have developed and tested a prototype VO-Role management system using the Community Authorization Service (CAS) from the Globus project. CAS allows for a flexible definition of resources. In this protoype we define a role as a resource within the CAS database and assign individuals in the VO access to that resource to indicate their ability to assert the role. The access of an individual to this VO-Role resource is then an annotation of the user's CAS proxy certificate. This annotation is then used by the local resource managers to authorize access to local compute and storage resources at a granularity which is base on neither VOs nor individuals. We report here on the configuration details for the CAS database and the Globus Gatekeeper and on how this general approch could be formalized and extended to meet the clear needs of LHC experiments using the Grid.",

    "abstract": "As computation spreads from computers to networks of computers, and migrates into cyberspace, it ceases to be globally programmable, but it remains programmable indirectly: network computations cannot be controlled, but they can be steered by local constraints on network nodes. The tasks of \"programming\" global behaviors through local constraints belong to the area of security. The \"program particles\" that assure that a system of local interactions leads towards some desired global goals are called security protocols. As computation spreads beyond cyberspace, into physical and social spaces, new security tasks and problems arise. As networks are extended by physical sensors and controllers, including the humans, and interlaced with social networks, the engineering concepts and techniques of computer security blend with the social processes of security. These new connectors for computational and social software require a new \"discipline of programming\" of global behaviors through local constraints. Since the new discipline seems to be emerging from a combination of established models of security protocols with older methods of procedural programming, we use the name procedures for these new connectors, that generalize protocols. In the present paper we propose actor-networks as a formal model of computation in heterogenous networks of computers, humans and their devices; and we introduce Procedure Derivation Logic (PDL) as a framework for reasoning about security in actor-networks. On the way, we survey the guiding ideas of Protocol Derivation Logic (also PDL) that evolved through our work in security in last 10 years. Both formalisms are geared towards graphic reasoning and tool support. We illustrate their workings by analysing a popular form of two-factor authentication, and a multi-channel device pairing procedure, devised for this occasion.",

The security needs of these applications are only client/server authentication and data integrity. For securing these open applications, effectively and efficiently, HTTPI, a new transport protocol is proposed, which ensures the entire security requirements of open applications. Benefit of using the HTTPI is that it is economical in use, well-suited for cache proxies, like HTTP is, and provides security against many Internet attacks (Server Impersonation and Message Modification) like HTTPS does. In terms of performance HTTPI is very close to the HTTP, but much better than HTTPS. A Web service is a method of communication between two ends over the Internet. These web services are developed over XML and HTTP. Today, most of the open applications use web services for most of their operations. For securing these web services, security design based on HTTPI is proposed. Our work involves securing the web services over SOAP, based on the HTTPI. This secure web service might be applicable for open applications, where authentication and integrity is needed, but no confidentiality required. In our paper, we introduce a web service security model based on HTTPI protocol over SOAP and develop a preliminary implementation of this model. We also analyze the performance of our approach through an experiment and show that our proposed approach provides higher throughput, lower average response time and lower response size than HTTPS based web service security approach.",

Now a days, most of the web browsers offer auto login feature for the favorite web sites such as yahoo, google, gmail etc. using these credential information. This facilitates the misuse of user credentials. Privatizing user credential information of web services in a shared user environment provides a feature enhancement where the root user will be able to privatize his stored credentials by enforcing some masking techniques such that even a user logs on to the system with root user credentials, he will not be able to access privatized data. In case of web browsers auto login feature, a root user can disable the feature manually by deleting entries from web browsers' saved password list. But this involves spending a considerable amount of time and the biggest problem is that he has to insert those credentials once again when he next visits these websites. This application resumes auto login feature whenever root user disable the masked mode. The application includes two parts: Masked Application Mode and Disabling the Masked Application Mode. When the system goes for masked application mode, the other user will not be able to use the credentials of the root user.If the other user tries to access any of the web pages which have been masked, the other user will have to authenticate with his own credentials. Disabling the masked mode requires authentication from the root user. As long as this credential is not shared, masked mode can be disabled only by the root user.",

    "abstract": "WiMAX is a promising technology that provides high data throughput with low delays for various user types and modes of operation. These advantages make WiMAX applicable both for infrastructure purposes and end-client usage. Since WiMAX is presented as a network framework and a last-mile technology, it is believed to be capable of handling a wide range of usage scenarios. For example, while the end users have an opportunity to use WiMAX as the primary connection medium for acquiring services such as on-demand video streaming, VoIP connections and mobile bank transactions, the service providers may use it for data relaying purposes among access points. To meet the technical requirements of these various scenarios, majority of the WiMAX research has been conducted on physical and MAC layers; however little has been invested in a comprehensive and efficient security solution, which has resulted in a wide range of security weaknesses and reactive solutions. Many security problems remain to be addressed in different modes and for different user types even in the final security standard of WiMAX, PKMv2. Mobile multi-hop relay (MMR) WiMAX networks have attracted lots of interest in wireless communication industry because of its scalable coverage, improved data rate and relatively low cost. Even with the additional security functionalities security of MMR WiMAX network is the main challenge because messages have to be transmitted through one or more relay stations, which makes it more difficult to ensure the authenticity of messages and entities involved in the transmission. In this thesis, we present a hybrid security solution to overcome the security problem of rogue station (BS/RS) attack and denial of service attack (DoS) in MMR WiMAX.",

    "abstract": "Due to Shor's algorithm, quantum computers are a severe threat for public key cryptography. This motivated the cryptographic community to search for quantum-safe solutions. On the other hand, the impact of quantum computing on secret key cryptography is much less understood. In this paper, we consider attacks where an adversary can query an oracle implementing a cryptographic primitive in a quantum superposition of different states. This model gives a lot of power to the adversary, but recent results show that it is nonetheless possible to build secure cryptosystems in it. We study applications of a quantum procedure called Simon's algorithm (the simplest quantum period finding algorithm) in order to attack symmetric cryptosystems in this model. Following previous works in this direction, we show that several classical attacks based on finding collisions can be dramatically sped up using Simon's algorithm: finding a collision requires $\\Omega(2^{n/2})$ queries in the classical setting, but when collisions happen with some hidden periodicity, they can be found with only $O(n)$ queries in the quantum model. We obtain attacks with very strong implications. First, we show that the most widely used modes of operation for authentication and authenticated encryption e.g. CBC-MAC, PMAC, GMAC, GCM, and OCB) are completely broken in this security model. Our attacks are also applicable to many CAESAR candidates: CLOC, AEZ, COPA, OTR, POET, OMD, and Minalpher. This is quite surprising compared to the situation with encryption modes: Anand et al. show that standard modes are secure with a quantum-secure PRF. Second, we show that Simon's algorithm can also be applied to slide attacks, leading to an exponential speed-up of a classical symmetric cryptanalysis technique in the quantum model.",

    "abstract": "Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are relatively new security primitives used for device authentication and device-specific secret key generation. In this paper we focus on SRAM-PUFs. The SRAM-PUFs enjoy uniqueness and randomness properties stemming from the intrinsic randomness of SRAM memory cells, which is a result of manufacturing variations. This randomness can be translated into the cryptographic keys thus avoiding the need to store and manage the device cryptographic keys. Therefore these properties, combined with the fact that SRAM memory can be often found in today's IoT devices, make SRAM-PUFs a promising candidate for securing and authentication of the resource-constrained IoT devices. PUF observations are always effected by noise and environmental changes. Therefore secret-generation schemes with helper data are used to guarantee reliable regeneration of the PUF-based secret keys. Error correction codes (ECCs) are an essential part of these schemes. In this work, we propose a practical error correction construction for PUF-based secret generation that are based on polar codes. The resulting scheme can generate $128$-bit keys using $1024$ SRAM-PUF bits and $896$ helper data bits and achieve a failure probability of $10^{-9}$ or lower for a practical SRAM-PUFs setting with bit error probability of $15\\%$. The method is based on successive cancellation combined with list decoding and hash-based checking that makes use of the hash that is already available at the decoder. In addition, an adaptive list decoder for polar codes is investigated. This decoder increases the list size only if needed.",

    "abstract": "We design and implement the first private and anonymous decentralized crowdsourcing system ZebraLancer, and overcome two fundamental challenges of decentralizing crowdsourcing, i.e., data leakage and identity breach. First, our outsource-then-prove methodology resolves the tension between the blockchain transparency and the data confidentiality to guarantee the basic utilities/fairness requirements of data crowdsourcing, thus ensuring: (i) a requester will not pay more than what data deserve, according to a policy announced when her task is published via the blockchain; (ii) each worker indeed gets a payment based on the policy, if he submits data to the blockchain; (iii) the above properties are realized not only without a central arbiter, but also without leaking the data to the open blockchain. Second, the transparency of blockchain allows one to infer private information about workers and requesters through their participation history. Simply enabling anonymity is seemingly attempting but will allow malicious workers to submit multiple times to reap rewards. ZebraLancer also overcomes this problem by allowing anonymous requests/submissions without sacrificing accountability. The idea behind is a subtle linkability: if a worker submits twice to a task, anyone can link the submissions, or else he stays anonymous and unlinkable across tasks. To realize this delicate linkability, we put forward a novel cryptographic concept, i.e., the common-prefix-linkable anonymous authentication. We remark the new anonymous authentication scheme might be of independent interest. Finally, we implement our protocol for a common image annotation task and deploy it in a test net of Ethereum. The experiment results show the applicability of our protocol atop the existing real-world blockchain.",

    "abstract": "Formulating and designing unforgeable authentication of classical messages in the presence of quantum adversaries has been a challenge, as the familiar classical notions of unforgeability do not directly translate into meaningful notions in the quantum setting. A particular difficulty is how to fairly capture the notion of \"predicting an unqueried value\" when the adversary can query in quantum superposition. In this work, we uncover serious shortcomings in existing approaches, and propose a new definition. We then support its viability by a number of constructions and characterizations. Specifically, we demonstrate a function which is secure according to the existing definition by Boneh and Zhandry, but is clearly vulnerable to a quantum forgery attack, whereby a query supported only on inputs that start with 0 divulges the value of the function on an input that starts with 1. We then propose a new definition, which we call \"blind-unforgeability\" (or BU.) This notion matches \"intuitive unpredictability\" in all examples studied thus far. It defines a function to be predictable if there exists an adversary which can use \"partially blinded\" oracle access to predict values in the blinded region. Our definition (BU) coincides with standard unpredictability (EUF-CMA) in the classical-query setting. We show that quantum-secure pseudorandom functions are BU-secure MACs. In addition, we show that BU satisfies a composition property (Hash-and-MAC) using \"Bernoulli-preserving\" hash functions, a new notion which may be of independent interest. Finally, we show that BU is amenable to security reductions by giving a precise bound on the extent to which quantum algorithms can deviate from their usual behavior due to the blinding in the BU security experiment.",

    "abstract": "Mobile Internet is becoming the norm. With more personalized mobile devices in hand, many services choose to offer alternative, usually more convenient, approaches to authenticating and delivering the content between mobile users and service providers. One main option is to use SMS (i.e., short messaging service). Such carrier-grade text service has been widely used to assist versatile mobile services, including social networking, banking, to name a few. Though the text service can be spoofed via certain Internet text service providers which cooperated with carriers, such attacks haven well studied and defended by industry due to the efforts of research community. However, as cellular network technology advances to the latest IP-based 4G LTE, we find that these mobile services are somehow exposed to new threats raised by this change, particularly on 4G LTE Text service (via brand-new distributed Mobile-Initiated Spoofed SMS attack which is not available in legacy 2G/3G systems). The reason is that messaging service over LTE shifts from the circuit-switched (CS) design to the packet-switched (PS) paradigm as 4G LTE supports PS only. Due to this change, 4G LTE Text Service becomes open to access. However, its shields to messaging integrity and user authentication are not in place. As a consequence, such weaknesses can be exploited to launch attacks (e.g., hijack Facebook accounts) against a targeted individual, a large scale of mobile users and even service providers, from mobile devices. Current defenses for Internet-Initiated Spoofed SMS attacks cannot defend the unprecedented attack. Our study shows that 53 of 64 mobile services over 27 industries are vulnerable to at least one threat. We validate these proof-of-concept attacks in one major US carrier which supports more than 100 million users. We finally propose quick fixes and discuss security insights and lessons we have learnt.",

    "abstract": "The OAuth 2.0 protocol is one of the most widely deployed authorization/single sign-on (SSO) protocols and also serves as the foundation for the new SSO standard OpenID Connect. Despite the popularity of OAuth, so far analysis efforts were mostly targeted at finding bugs in specific implementations and were based on formal models which abstract from many web features or did not provide a formal treatment at all. In this paper, we carry out the first extensive formal analysis of the OAuth 2.0 standard in an expressive web model. Our analysis aims at establishing strong authorization, authentication, and session integrity guarantees, for which we provide formal definitions. In our formal analysis, all four OAuth grant types (authorization code grant, implicit grant, resource owner password credentials grant, and the client credentials grant) are covered. They may even run simultaneously in the same and different relying parties and identity providers, where malicious relying parties, identity providers, and browsers are considered as well. Our modeling and analysis of the OAuth 2.0 standard assumes that security recommendations and best practices are followed, in order to avoid obvious and known attacks. When proving the security of OAuth in our model, we discovered four attacks which break the security of OAuth. The vulnerabilities can be exploited in practice and are present also in OpenID Connect. We propose fixes for the identified vulnerabilities, and then, for the first time, actually prove the security of OAuth in an expressive web model. In particular, we show that the fixed version of OAuth (with security recommendations and best practices in place) provides the authorization, authentication, and session integrity properties we specify.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have achieved high performance on many tasks, and thus have been applied to many security-critical scenarios. For example, deep learning-based face recognition systems have been used to authenticate users to access many security-sensitive applications like payment apps. Such usages of deep learning systems provide the adversaries with sufficient incentives to perform attacks against these systems for their adversarial purposes. In this work, we consider a new type of attacks, called backdoor attacks, where the attacker's goal is to create a backdoor into a learning-based authentication system, so that he can easily circumvent the system by leveraging the backdoor. Specifically, the adversary aims at creating backdoor instances, so that the victim learning system will be misled to classify the backdoor instances as a target label specified by the adversary. In particular, we study backdoor poisoning attacks, which achieve backdoor attacks using poisoning strategies. Different from all existing work, our studied poisoning strategies can apply under a very weak threat model: (1) the adversary has no knowledge of the model and the training set used by the victim system; (2) the attacker is allowed to inject only a small amount of poisoning samples; (3) the backdoor key is hard to notice even by human beings to achieve stealthiness. We conduct evaluation to demonstrate that a backdoor adversary can inject only around 50 poisoning samples, while achieving an attack success rate of above 90%. We are also the first work to show that a data poisoning attack can create physically implementable backdoors without touching the training process. Our work demonstrates that backdoor poisoning attacks pose real threats to a learning system, and thus highlights the importance of further investigation and proposing defense strategies against them.",

    "abstract": "A pilot spoofer can paralyze the channel estimation in multi-user orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFD- M) systems by using the same publicly-known pilot tones as legitimate nodes. This causes the problem of pilot authentication (PA). To solve this, we propose, for a two-user multi-antenna OFDM system, a code-frequency block group (CFBG) coding based PA mechanism. Here multi-user pilot information, after being randomized independently to avoid being spoofed, are converted into activation patterns of subcarrier-block groups on code-frequency domain. Those patterns, though overlapped and interfered mutually in the wireless transmission environment, are qualified to be separated and identified as the original pilots with high accuracy, by exploiting CFBG coding theory and channel characteristic. Particularly, we develop the CFBG code through two steps, i.e., 1) devising an ordered signal detection technique to recognize the number of signals coexisting on each subcarrier block, and encoding each subcarrier block with the detected number; 2) constructing a zero-false-drop (ZFD) code and block detection based (BD) code via k-dimensional Latin hypercubes and integrating those two codes into the CFBG code. This code can bring a desirable pilot separation error probability (SEP), inversely proportional to the number of occupied subcarriers and antennas with a power of k. To apply the code to PA, a scheme of pilot conveying, separation and identification is proposed. Based on this novel PA, a joint channel estimation and identification mechanism is proposed to achieve high-precision channel recovery and simultaneously enhance PA without occupying extra resources. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Personal cryptographic keys are the foundation of many secure services, but storing these keys securely is a challenge, especially if they are used from multiple devices. Storing keys in a centralized location, like an Internet-accessible server, raises serious security concerns (e.g. server compromise). Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a well-known solution for protecting sensitive data in untrusted environments, and are now becoming available on commodity server platforms. Although the idea of protecting keys using a server-side TEE is straight-forward, in this paper we validate this approach and show that it enables new desirable functionality. We describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a TEE-based Cloud Key Store (CKS), an online service for securely generating, storing, and using personal cryptographic keys. Using remote attestation, users receive strong assurance about the behaviour of the CKS, and can authenticate themselves using passwords while avoiding typical risks of password-based authentication like password theft or phishing. In addition, this design allows users to i) define policy-based access controls for keys; ii) delegate keys to other CKS users for a specified time and/or a limited number of uses; and iii) audit all key usages via a secure audit log. We have implemented a proof of concept CKS using Intel SGX and integrated this into GnuPG on Linux and OpenKeychain on Android. Our CKS implementation performs approximately 6,000 signature operations per second on a single desktop PC. The latency is in the same order of magnitude as using locally-stored keys, and 20x faster than smart cards.",

    ],
    "abstract": "The wide deployment of tokens for digital assets on top of Ethereum implies the need for powerful trading platforms. Vickrey auctions have been known to determine the real market price of items as bidders are motivated to submit their own monetary valuations without leaking their information to the competitors. Recent constructions have utilized various cryptographic protocols such as ZKP and MPC, however, these approaches either are partially privacy-preserving or require complex computations with several rounds. In this paper, we overcome these limits by presenting Trustee as a Vickrey auction on Ethereum which fully preserves bids' privacy at relatively much lower fees. Trustee consists of three components: a front-end smart contract deployed on Ethereum, an Intel SGX enclave, and a relay to redirect messages between them. Initially, the enclave generates an Ethereum account and ECDH key-pair. Subsequently, the relay publishes the account's address and ECDH public key on the smart contract. As a prerequisite, bidders are encouraged to verify the authenticity and security of Trustee by using the SGX remote attestation service. To participate in the auction, bidders utilize the ECDH public key to encrypt their bids and submit them to the smart contract. Once the bidding interval is closed, the relay retrieves the encrypted bids and feeds them to the enclave that autonomously generates a signed transaction indicating the auction winner. Finally, the relay submits the transaction to the smart contract which verifies the transaction's authenticity and the parameters' consistency before accepting the claimed auction winner. As part of our contributions, we have made a prototype for Trustee available on Github for the community to review and inspect it. Additionally, we analyze the security features of Trustee and report on the transactions' gas cost incurred on Trustee smart contract.",

    "abstract": "Recent research in quantum cryptography has led to the development of schemes that encrypt and authenticate quantum messages with computational security. The security definitions used so far in the literature are asymptotic, game-based, and not known to be composable. We show how to define finite, composable, computational security for secure quantum message transmission. The new definitions do not involve any games or oracles, they are directly operational: a scheme is secure if it transforms an insecure channel and a shared key into an ideal secure channel from Alice to Bob, i.e., one which only allows Eve to block messages and learn their size, but not change them or read them. By modifying the ideal channel to provide Eve with more or less capabilities, one gets an array of different security notions. By design these transformations are composable, resulting in composable security. Crucially, the new definitions are finite. Security does not rely on the asymptotic hardness of a computational problem. Instead, one proves a finite reduction: if an adversary can distinguish the constructed (real) channel from the ideal one (for some fixed security parameters), then she can solve a finite instance of some computational problem. Such a finite statement is needed to make security claims about concrete implementations. We then prove that (slightly modified versions of) protocols proposed in the literature satisfy these composable definitions. And finally, we study the relations between some game-based definitions and our composable ones. In particular, we look at notions of quantum authenticated encryption and QCCA2, and show that they suffer from the same issues as their classical counterparts: they exclude certain protocols which are arguably secure.",

    "abstract": "With the increase of credit card usage, the volume of credit card misuse also has significantly increased. As a result, financial organizations are working hard on developing and deploying credit card fraud detection methods, in order to adapt to ever-evolving, increasingly sophisticated defrauding strategies and identifying illicit transactions as quickly as possible to protect themselves and their customers. Compounding on the complex nature of such adverse strategies, credit card fraudulent activities are rare events compared to the number of legitimate transactions. Hence, the challenge to develop fraud detection that are accurate and efficient is substantially intensified and, as a consequence, credit card fraud detection has lately become a very active area of research. In this work, we provide a survey of current techniques most relevant to the problem of credit card fraud detection. We carry out our survey in two main parts. In the first part,we focus on studies utilizing classical machine learning models, which mostly employ traditional transnational features to make fraud predictions. These models typically rely on some static physical characteristics, such as what the user knows (knowledge-based method), or what he/she has access to (object-based method). In the second part of our survey, we review more advanced techniques of user authentication, which use behavioral biometrics to identify an individual based on his/her unique behavior while he/she is interacting with his/her electronic devices. These approaches rely on how people behave (instead of what they do), which cannot be easily forged. By providing an overview of current approaches and the results reported in the literature, this survey aims to drive the future research agenda for the community in order to develop more accurate, reliable and scalable models of credit card fraud detection.",

    "abstract": "Fog computing is an emerging computing paradigm that has come into consideration for the deployment of IoT applications amongst researchers and technology industries over the last few years. Fog is highly distributed and consists of a wide number of autonomous end devices, which contribute to the processing. However, the variety of devices offered across different users are not audited. Hence, the security of Fog devices is a major concern in the Fog computing environment. Furthermore, mitigating and preventing those security measures is a research issue. Therefore, to provide the necessary security for Fog devices, we need to understand what the security concerns are with regards to Fog. All aspects of Fog security, which have not been covered by other literature works needs to be identified and need to be aggregate all issues in Fog security. It needs to be noted that computation devices consist of many ordinary users, and are not managed by any central entity or managing body. Therefore, trust and privacy is also a key challenge to gain market adoption for Fog. To provide the required trust and privacy, we need to also focus on authentication, threats and access control mechanisms as well as techniques in Fog computing. In this paper, we perform a survey and propose a taxonomy, which presents an overview of existing security concerns in the context of the Fog computing paradigm. We discuss the Blockchain-based solutions towards a secure Fog computing environment and presented various research challenges and directions for future research.",

    ],
    "abstract": "ARINC 429 is the most common data bus in use today in civil avionics. However, the protocol lacks any form of source authentication. A technician with physical access to the bus is able to replace a transmitter by a rogue device, and the receivers will accept its malicious data as they have no method of verifying the authenticity of messages. Updating the protocol would close off security loopholes in new aircraft but would require thousands of airplanes to be modified. For the interim, until the protocol is replaced, we propose the first intrusion detection system that utilizes a hardware fingerprinting approach for sender identification for the ARINC 429 data bus. Our approach relies on the observation that changes in hardware, such as replacing a transmitter or a receiver with a rogue one, modify the electric signal of the transmission. Because we rely on the analog properties, and not on the digital content of the transmissions, we are able to detect a hardware switch as soon as it occurs, even if the data that is being transmitted is completely normal. Thus, we are able to preempt the attack before any damage is caused. In this paper we describe the design of our intrusion detection system and evaluate its performance against different adversary models. Our analysis includes both a theoretical Markov-chain model and an extensive empirical evaluation. For this purpose, we collected a data corpus of ARINC 429 data traces, which may be of independent interest since, to the best of our knowledge, no public corpus is available. We find that our intrusion detection system is quite realistic: e.g., it achieves near-zero false alarms per second, while detecting a rogue transmitter in under 50ms, and detecting a rogue receiver in under 3 seconds. In other words, technician attacks can be reliably detected during the pre-flight checks, well before the aircraft takes off.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem \\textit{good-case latency} of Byzantine agreement, broadcast and state machine replication in the synchronous authenticated setting. The good-case latency measure captures the time it takes to reach agreement when all non-faulty parties have the same input (or in BB/SMR when the sender/leader is non-faulty). Previous result implies a lower bound showing that any Byzantine agreement or broadcast protocol tolerating more than $n/3$ faults must have a good-case latency of at least $\\Delta$, where $\\Delta$ is the assumed maximum message delay bound. Our first result is a family of protocols we call $1\\Delta$ that have near-optimal good-case latency. We propose a protocol $1\\Delta$-BA that solves Byzantine agreement in the synchronous and authenticated setting with near-optimal good-case latency of $\\Delta+2\\delta$ and optimal resilience $f<n/2$, where $\\delta$ is the actual (unknown) delay bound. We then extend our protocol and present $1\\Delta$-BB and $1\\Delta$-SMR for Byzantine fault tolerant broadcast and state machine replication, respectively, in the same setting and with the same good-case latency of $\\Delta+2\\delta$ and $f<n/2$ fault tolerance. Our $1\\Delta$-SMR upper bound improves the gap between the best current solution, Sync HotStuff, which obtains a good-case latency of $2\\Delta$ per command and the lower bound of $\\Delta$ on good-case latency. Finally, we investigate weaker notions of the synchronous setting and show how to adopt the $1\\Delta$ approach to these models.",

    "abstract": "Nanoscale communication systems operating in Ter-ahertz (THz) band are anticipated to revolutionise the healthcaresystems of the future. Global wireless data traffic is undergoinga rapid growth. However, wireless systems, due to their broad-casting nature, are vulnerable to malicious security breaches. Inaddition, advances in quantum computing poses a risk to existingcrypto-based information security. It is of the utmost importanceto make the THz systems resilient to potential active and passiveattacks which may lead to devastating consequences, especiallywhen handling sensitive patient data in healthcare systems. Newstrategies are needed to analyse these malicious attacks and topropose viable countermeasures. In this manuscript, we presenta new authentication mechanism for nanoscale communicationsystems operating in THz band at the physical layer. We assessedan impersonation attack on a THz system. We propose usingpath loss as a fingerprint to conduct authentication via two-stephypothesis testing for a transmission device. We used hiddenMarkov Model (HMM) viterbi algorithm to enhance the outputof hypothesis testing. We also conducted transmitter identificationusing maximum likelihood and Gaussian mixture model (GMM)expectation maximization algorithms. Our simulations showedthat the error probabilities are a decreasing functions of SNR. At 10 dB with 0.2 false alarm, the detection probability was almostone. We further observed that HMM out-performs hypothesistesting at low SNR regime (10% increase in accuracy is recordedat SNR =5 dB) whereas the GMM is useful when groundtruths are noisy. Our work addresses major security gaps facedby communication system either through malicious breachesor quantum computing, enabling new applications of nanoscalesystems for Industry 4.0.",

    "abstract": "Virtual applications through mobile platforms are one of the most critical and ever-growing fields in AI, where ubiquitous and real-time person authentication has become critical after the breakthrough of all services provided via mobile devices. In this context, face verification technologies can provide reliable and robust user authentication, given the availability of cameras in these devices, as well as their widespread use in everyday applications. The rapid development of deep Convolutional Neural Networks has resulted in many accurate face verification architectures. However, their typical size (hundreds of megabytes) makes them infeasible to be incorporated in downloadable mobile applications where the entire file typically may not exceed 100 Mb. Accordingly, we address the challenge of developing a lightweight face recognition network of just a few megabytes that can operate with sufficient accuracy in comparison to much larger models. The network also should be able to operate under different poses, given the variability naturally observed in uncontrolled environments where mobile devices are typically used. In this paper, we adapt the lightweight SqueezeNet model, of just 4.4MB, to effectively provide cross-pose face recognition. After trained on the MS-Celeb-1M and VGGFace2 databases, our model achieves an EER of 1.23% on the difficult frontal vs. profile comparison, and0.54% on profile vs. profile images. Under less extreme variations involving frontal images in any of the enrolment/query images pair, EER is pushed down to<0.3%, and the FRR at FAR=0.1%to less than 1%. This makes our light model suitable for face recognition where at least acquisition of the enrolment image can be controlled. At the cost of a slight degradation in performance, we also test an even lighter model (of just 2.5MB) where regular convolutions are replaced with depth-wise separable convolutions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the Dragonblood attacks have attracted new interests on the security of WPA-3 implementation and in particular on the Dragonfly code deployed on many open-source libraries. One attack concerns the protection of users passwords during authentication. In the Password Authentication Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol called Dragonfly, the secret, namely the password, is mapped to an elliptic curve point. This operation is sensitive, as it involves the secret password, and therefore its resistance against side-channel attacks is of utmost importance. Following the initial disclosure of Dragonblood, we notice that this particular attack has been partially patched by only a few implementations. In this work, we show that the patches implemented after the disclosure of Dragonblood are insufficient. We took advantage of state-of-the-art techniques to extend the original attack, demonstrating that we are able to recover the password with only a third of the measurements needed in Dragonblood attack. We mainly apply our attack on two open-source projects: iwd (iNet Wireless Daemon) and FreeRADIUS, in order underline the practicability of our attack. Indeed, the iwd package, written by Intel, is already deployed in the Arch Linux distribution, which is well-known among security experts, and aims to offer an alternative to wpa\\_supplicant. As for FreeRADIUS, it is widely deployed and well-maintained upstream open-source project. We publish a full Proof of Concept of our attack, and actively participated in the process of patching the vulnerable code. Here, in a backward compatibility perspective, we advise the use of a branch-free implementation as a mitigation technique, as what was used in hostapd, due to its quite simplicity and its negligible incurred overhead.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes an architecture for a distributing processing system that would allow remote procedure calls to invoke other services as messages are passed between clients and servers. It proposes that an additional class of data processing objects be located in the software communications channel. The objects in this channel would then be used to enforce protocols on client-server applications without any additional effort by the application programmers. For example, services such as key-management, time-stamping, sequencing and encryption can be implemented at different levels of the software communications stack to provide a complete authentication service. A distributing processing environment could be used to control broadband network data delivery. Architectures and invocation semantics are discussed, Example classes and interfaces for channel objects are given in the Java programming language.",

    "abstract": "We study how to efficiently diffuse updates to a large distributed system of data replicas, some of which may exhibit arbitrary (Byzantine) failures. We assume that strictly fewer than $t$ replicas fail, and that each update is initially received by at least $t$ correct replicas. The goal is to diffuse each update to all correct replicas while ensuring that correct replicas accept no updates generated spuriously by faulty replicas. To achieve reliable diffusion, each correct replica accepts an update only after receiving it from at least $t$ others. We provide the first analysis of epidemic-style protocols for such environments. This analysis is fundamentally different from known analyses for the benign case due to our treatment of fully Byzantine failures---which, among other things, precludes the use of digital signatures for authenticating forwarded updates. We propose two epidemic-style diffusion algorithms and two measures that characterize the efficiency of diffusion algorithms in general. We characterize both of our algorithms according to these measures, and also prove lower bounds with regards to these measures that show that our algorithms are close to optimal.",

In such settings, we encounter unique authentication, authorization, resource access, resource discovery, and other challenges. It is this class of problem that is addressed by Grid technologies. Next, we present an extensible and open Grid architecture, in which protocols, services, application programming interfaces, and software development kits are categorized according to their roles in enabling resource sharing. We describe requirements that we believe any such mechanisms must satisfy, and we discuss the central role played by the intergrid protocols that enable interoperability among different Grid systems. Finally, we discuss how Grid technologies relate to other contemporary technologies, including enterprise integration, application service provider, storage service provider, and peer-to-peer computing. We maintain that Grid concepts and technologies complement and have much to contribute to these other approaches.",

    "abstract": "A secure timeline is a tamper-evident historic record of the states through which a system goes throughout its operational history. Secure timelines can help us reason about the temporal ordering of system states in a provable manner. We extend secure timelines to encompass multiple, mutually distrustful services, using timeline entanglement. Timeline entanglement associates disparate timelines maintained at independent systems, by linking undeniably the past of one timeline to the future of another. Timeline entanglement is a sound method to map a time step in the history of one service onto the timeline of another, and helps clients of entangled services to get persistent temporal proofs for services rendered that survive the demise or non-cooperation of the originating service. In this paper we present the design and implementation of Timeweave, our service development framework for timeline entanglement based on two novel disk-based authenticated data structures. We evaluate Timeweave's performance characteristics and show that it can be efficiently deployed in a loosely-coupled distributed system of a few hundred services with overhead of roughly 2-8% of the processing resources of a PC-grade system.",

This library extends the Argonne MPICH implementation of MPI to use services provided by the Globus Toolkit for authentication, authorization, resource allocation, executable staging, and I/O, as well as for process creation, monitoring, and control. Various performance-critical operations, including startup and collective operations, are configured to exploit network topology information. The library also exploits MPI constructs for performance management; for example, the MPI communicator construct is used for application-level discovery of, and adaptation to, both network topology and network quality-of-service mechanisms. We describe the MPICH-G2 design and implementation, present performance results, and review application experiences, including record-setting distributed simulations.",

Each phase is represented by a set of abstract interfaces. These interfaces allow different techniques to be used without modification to the framework. For example, the communications interface has been implemented by both a packet protocol and a SOAP-based scheme. User authentication can be provided either through simple passwords or through a GSI certificates system.

Unfortunately, from our analysis it comes up that it is not secure. We describe an attack which permits to recover the corresponding plaintext from a given ciphertext. The same attack can be applied to produce forgeries if the cryptosystem is used for signing messages. Then, we point out that also other primitives, a Diffie-Hellman like key agreement scheme and an authentication scheme, designed along the same lines of the cryptosystem, are not secure due to the aforementioned attack. We close the paper by discussing the issues and the possibilities of constructing public key cryptosystems on real numbers.",

We will focus on two simple issues: the problem of using adequate passwords and the problem of managing passwords. The proposed solution, the pathword, is a method that guarantees: 1 that the passwords generated with the help of a pathword are adequate (i.e. that they are not easy to guess), 2 that managing pathwords is more user friendly than managing passwords and that pathwords are less amenable to problems typical of passwords.",

In this paper we put forth a more practical alternative based on the following soundness theorem. We prove that for a large class of security properties (that includes rather standard formulations for secrecy and authenticity properties), security of protocols in the simpler model implies security in the label-based model. Combined with the soundness result of (\\textbf{?}) our theorem enables the translation of security results in unlabeled symbolic models to computational security.",

The first one guarantees data confidentiality through secret sharing, while the second and third ones provide data availability through information dispersal.

    "abstract": "Tremendous research effort was invested in audio browsers and machine learning techniques to decode the structure of Web pages in order to put them into an audio format. In this paper, we address a simpler and efficient solution for the creation of an audio browser of VOICEXML generated from RSS/Atom stream feeds. We developed a multimodal (audio and graphical) portal application that offers RSS/Atom feeds. By utilizing sing our system, the user can interact using voice or graphic commands, listen and watch digital content, such as news, blogs feeds, podcasts, and even access email and personal schedules. The portal system permits the use of security credentials (user/password authentication) to collect secure RSS/Atom stream in the multimodal browser to connect the user to specific personal services. A series experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the RSS reader and navigator. Our system is extremely beneficial for a wide range of applications, from interfaces for the visual impaired users to browsers for mobile telephonic interfaces.",

    "abstract": "A two-layer quantum protocol for secure transmission of data using qubits is presented. The protocol is an improvement over the BB84 QKD protocol. BB84, in conjunction with the one-time pad algorithm, has been shown to be unconditionally secure. However it suffers from two drawbacks: (1) Its security relies on the assumption that Alice's qubit source is perfect in the sense that it does not inadvertently emit multiple copies of the same qubit. A multi-qubit emission attack can be launched if this assumption is violated. (2) BB84 cannot transfer predetermined keys; the keys it can distribute are generated in the process. Our protocol does not have these drawbacks. As in BB84, our protocol requires an authenticated public channel so as to detect an intruder's interaction with the quantum channel, but unlike in symmetric-key cryptography, the confidentiality of transmitted data does not rely on a shared secret key.",

    "abstract": "A secure human identification protocol aims at authenticating human users to a remote server when even the users' inputs are not hidden from an adversary. Recently, the authors proposed a human identification protocol in the RSA Conference 2007, which is loosely based on the ability of humans to efficiently process an image. The advantage being that an automated adversary is not effective in attacking the protocol without human assistance. This paper extends that work by trying to solve some of the open problems. First, we analyze the complexity of defeating the proposed protocols by quantifying the workload of a human adversary. Secondly, we propose a new construction based on textual CAPTCHAs (Reverse Turing Tests) in order to make the generation of automated challenges easier. We also present a brief experiment involving real human users to find out the number of possible attributes in a given image and give some guidelines for the selection of challenge questions based on the results. Finally, we analyze the previously proposed protocol in detail for the relationship between the secrets. Our results show that we can construct human identification protocols based on image evaluation with reasonably ``quantified'' security guarantees based on our model.",

The goal of pervasive computing is to render computing transparent, such that computing resources are ubiquitously offered to the user and services are proactively performed for a user without his or her intervention. The task of integrating computing infrastructure into everyday life without making it excessively invasive brings about tradeoffs between flexibility and robustness, efficiency and effectiveness, as well as autonomy and reliability. As the feasibility of ubiquitous computing and its real potential for mass applications are still a matter of controversy, this chapter will look into the underlying issues of resource management and authentication to discover how these can be handled in a least invasive fashion. The discussion will be closed by an overview of the solutions proposed by current pervasive computing efforts, both in the area of generic platforms and for dedicated applications such as pervasive education and healthcare.",

That is, any such scheme can be broken with probability close to $1$ by a (computationally unbounded) adversary making $2^{(1+o(1))q}$ queries to the oracle. This is tight up to a constant factor in the number of queries, since a simple modification of Lamport's one-time signatures (Lamport '79) achieves $2^{(0.812-o(1))q}$ black-box security using $q$ queries to the oracle. Our result extends (with a loss of a constant factor in the number of queries) also to the random permutation and ideal-cipher oracles. Since the symmetric primitives (e.g. block ciphers, hash functions, and message authentication codes) can be constructed by a constant number of queries to the mentioned oracles, as corollary we get lower bounds on the efficiency of signature schemes from symmetric primitives when the construction is black-box. This can be taken as evidence of an inherent efficiency gap between signature schemes and symmetric primitives.",

Robust fuzzy extractors were defined by Dodis et al. in Crypto 2006 to be noninteractive, i.e., only one message P, which can be modified by an unbounded adversary, can pass from one party to the other. This allows them to be used by a single party at different points in time (e.g., for key recovery or biometric authentication), but also presents an additional challenge: what if R is used, and thus possibly observed by the adversary, before the adversary has a chance to modify P. Fuzzy extractors secure against such a strong attack are called post-application robust. We construct a fuzzy extractor with post-application robustness that extracts a shared secret key of up to (2m-n)/2 bits (depending on error-tolerance and security parameters), where n is the bit-length and m is the entropy of W. The previously best known result, also of Dodis et al., extracted up to (2m-n)/3 bits (depending on the same parameters).",

This falls under the \"channel-type model with wiretapper\" considered by Ahlswede and Csiszar.

Our strategy for approaching this ideal is to first find the simplest structure within which these goals can plausibly be achieved. This structure, we find, is given by a particular recursive distributive lattice freely constructed from a presumed partially ordered set of all data in the infrastructure. Minor syntactic adjustments to the resulting algebra yields a simple language resembling a UNIX shell, a concept of execution and an interprocess protocol. Persons, organizations and servers within the system express their interests explicitly via a hierarchical currency. The currency provides a common framework for treating authentication, access control and resource sharing as economic problems while also introducing a new dimension for improving the infrastructure over time by designing system components which compete with each other to earn the currency. We explain these results, discuss experience with an implementation called egg and point out areas where more research is needed.",

We first present a polynomial-time approximation scheme for minimizing the average number of multicast messages needed for an update. We next show that when routing costs are considered, the problem is NP-hard even when the underlying routing network is a tree network or even when every group member has the same update frequency.

These protocols can be easily adapted to the personal entropy setting, where a user can recover a password only if he can answer a large enough subset of personal questions. We introduce client-server password recovery methods, in which the recovery data are stored at the server, and the recovery procedures are integrated into the login procedures. These methods apply to two of the most common types of password based authentication systems. The security of these solutions is significantly better than the security of presently proposed password recovery schemes. Our protocols are based on a variation of threshold encryption that may be of independent interest.",

We show that the strength of passwords chosen by users varies enormously, and that the cost of attacks based on password strength grows very quickly when the attacker wants to obtain a higher success percentage. In accordance with existing studies we observe that, in the absence of measures for enforcing password strength, weak passwords are common. On the other hand we discover that there will always be a subset of users with extremely strong passwords that are very unlikely to be broken.

    "abstract": "We propose a routing protocol for wireless networks. Wireless routing protocols allow hosts within a network to have some knowledge of the topology in order to know when to forward a packet (via broadcast) and when to drop it. Since a routing protocol forms the backbone of a network, it is a lucrative target for many attacks, all of which attempt to disrupt network traffic by corrupting routing tables of neighboring routers using false updates. Secure routing protocols designed for wired networks (such as S-BGP) are not scalable in an ad-hoc wireless environment because of two main drawbacks: (1) the need to maintain knowledge about all immediate neighbors (which requires a discovery protocol), and (2) the need to transmit the same update several times, one for each neighbor. Although information about neighbors is readily available in a fairly static and wired network, such information is often not updated or available in an ad-hoc wireless network with mobile devices. Our protocol is a variant of S-BGP called SS-BGP and allows a single broadcast for routing updates without having the need to be aware of every neighboring router. The protocol is based on a novel authentication primitive called Enhanced Chain Signatures (ECS).",

However, many of the schemes known are impractical, either because they use hash functions instead of the more hardware efficient symmetric encryption schemes as a efficient cryptographic primitive, or because they incur a rather costly key search time penalty at the reader. Moreover, they do not allow for dynamic, fine-grained access control to the tag that cater for more complex usage scenarios. In this paper we investigate such scenarios, and propose a model and corresponding privacy friendly protocols for efficient and fine-grained management of access permissions to tags. In particular we propose an efficient mutual authentication protocol between a tag and a reader that achieves a reasonable level of privacy, using only symmetric key cryptography on the tag, while not requiring a costly key-search algorithm at the reader side.

Formulas expressing authentication and non-disclosure properties of protocols have a special form. They are quantified implications for all xs . (phi implies for some ys . psi). Models (interpretations) for these formulas are *skeletons*, partially ordered structures consisting of a number of local protocol behaviors. Realized skeletons contain enough local sessions to explain all the behavior, when combined with some possible adversary behaviors. We show two results. (1) If phi is the antecedent of a security goal, then there is a skeleton A_phi such that, for every skeleton B, phi is satisfied in B iff there is a homomorphism from A_phi to B. (2) A protocol enforces for all xs . (phi implies for some ys . psi) iff every realized homomorphic image of A_phi satisfies psi. Hence, to verify a security goal, one can use the Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer CPSA (TACAS, 2007) to identify minimal realized skeletons, or \"shapes,\" that are homomorphic images of A_phi. If psi holds in each of these shapes, then the goal holds.",

    "abstract": "While performing knowledge-intensive tasks of professional nature, the knowledge workers need to access and process large volume of information. Apart from the quantity, they also require that the information received is of high quality in terms of authenticity and details. This, in turn, requires that the information delivered should also include argumentative support, exhibiting the reasoning process behind their development and provenance to indicate their lineage. In conventional document-centric practices for information management, such details are difficult to capture, represent/archive and retrieve/deliver. To achieve such capability we need to re-think some core issues of information management from the above requirements perspective. In this paper we develop a framework for comprehensive representation of information in archive, capturing informational contents along with their context. We shall call it the \"Information Warehouse (IW)\" framework of information archival. The IW is a significant yet technologically realizable conceptual advancement which can support efficiently some interesting classes of applications which can be very useful to the knowledge workers.",

Making biometric based solution mobile is a promising trend. A new RST invariant square based palm print ROI extraction method was successfully implemented and integrated into the current application suite. A new set of palm print image database captured using embedded cameras in mobile phone was created to test its robustness. Comparing to those extraction methods that are based on boundary tracking of the overall hand shape that has limitation of being unable to process palm print images that has one or more fingers closed, the system can now effectively handle the segmentation of palm print images with varying finger positioning. The high flexibility makes palm print matching mobile possible.",

Nodes act both as hosts and routers and are interconnected by Multi- hop communication path for forwarding and receiving packets to/from other nodes. The objective of this paper is to propose a key exchange and encryption mechanism that aims to use the MAC address as an additional parameter as the message specific key[to encrypt]and forward data among the nodes. The nodes are organized in spanning tree fashion, as they avoid forming cycles and exchange of key occurs only with authenticated neighbors in ad hoc networks, where nodes join or leave the network dynamically.",

We propose modified key distribution protocols for which we prove explicit estimates of key rates without the use of estimates with uncertain coefficients in notations $O,\\Omega,\\Theta$. This leads in the new conclusion that the use of extractors is superior to the use of hash functions only with the very large key lengths $\\ell$ (of order $\\ell>10^5$ bits). We suggest hybrid key distribution protocols consisting from two consecutively executed stages. At the fist stage it is generated a short authentication key based on hash function, whereas at the second stage it is generated the final key with the use of extractors. We show that in fact the use of extraction procedure is effective only at the second stage. We get also some constructive estimates of the key rates for such protocols.",

Despite a number of novel, theoretical advances, it has been unclear if and how quantitative approaches to measuring leakage of confidential information could be applied to substantial, real-world programs. This is mostly due to the high complexity of computing precise leakage quantities. In this paper, we introduce a technique which makes it possible to decide if a program conforms to a quantitative policy which scales to large state-spaces with the help of bounded model checking. Our technique is applied to a number of officially reported information leak vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel. Additionally, we also analysed authentication routines in the Secure Remote Password suite and of a Internet Message Support Protocol implementation. Our technique shows when there is unacceptable leakage; the same technique is also used to verify, for the first time, that the applied software patches indeed plug the information leaks. This is the first demonstration of quantitative information flow addressing security concerns of real-world industrial programs.",

In contrast to HB, NLHB relies on the complexity of decoding a class of non-linear codes to render the passive attacks proposed against HB ineffective. In this paper, we show that passive attacks against HB protocol can still be applicable to NLHB and this protocol does not provide the desired security margin. In our attack, we first linearize the non-linear part of NLHB to obtain a HB equivalent for NLHB, and then exploit the passive attack techniques proposed for the HB to evaluate the security margin of NLHB. The results show that although NLHB's security margin is relatively higher than HB against similar passive attack techniques, it has been overestimated and, in contrary to what is claimed, NLHB is vulnerable to passive attacks against HB, especially when the noise vector in the protocol has a low weight.",

This random number generator consists of a state machine that mixes unpredictable data with the output of a one way hash function. According the specification it can be a good source of unpredictable random numbers even without having to require a genuine source of hardware entropy. However the specification recommends collecting entropy from any internal sources available such as clock jitter or thermal noise in the chip itself, a feature that was implemented by most manufacturers.

    "abstract": "Speech recognition and speaker identification are important for authentication and verification in security purpose, but they are difficult to achieve. Speaker identification methods can be divided into text-independent and text-dependent. This paper presents a technique of text-dependent speaker identification using MFCC-domain support vector machine (SVM). In this work, melfrequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) and their statistical distribution properties are used as features, which will be inputs to the neural network. This work firstly used sequential minimum optimization (SMO) learning technique for SVM that improve performance over traditional techniques Chunking, Osuna. The cepstrum coefficients representing the speaker characteristics of a speech segment are computed by nonlinear filter bank analysis and discrete cosine transform. The speaker identification ability and convergence speed of the SVMs are investigated for different combinations of features. Extensive experimental results on several samples show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by authentication, intrusion and spam detection applications we consider single-class classification (SCC) as a two-person game between the learner and an adversary. In this game the learner has a sample from a target distribution and the goal is to construct a classifier capable of distinguishing observations from the target distribution from observations emitted from an unknown other distribution. The ideal SCC classifier must guarantee a given tolerance for the false-positive error (false alarm rate) while minimizing the false negative error (intruder pass rate). Viewing SCC as a two-person zero-sum game we identify both deterministic and randomized optimal classification strategies for different game variants. We demonstrate that randomized classification can provide a significant advantage. In the deterministic setting we show how to reduce SCC to two-class classification where in the two-class problem the other class is a synthetically generated distribution. We provide an efficient and practical algorithm for constructing and solving the two class problem. The algorithm distinguishes low density regions of the target distribution and is shown to be consistent.",

Various ad hoc communication frameworks have been proposed for emergency response situations.

    "abstract": "In a multi-hop mobile ad hoc network (MANET), mobile nodes cooperate to form a network without using any infrastructure such as access points or base stations. The mobility of the nodes and the fundamentally limited capacity of the wireless medium, together with wireless transmission effects such as attenuation, multi-path propagation, and interference combine to create sig-nificant challenges for security in MANETs. Traditional cryptographic mecha-nisms such as authentication and encryption are not capable of handling some kinds of attacks such as packet dropping by malicious nodes in MANETs. This paper presents a mechanism for detecting malicious packet dropping attacks in MANETs. The mechanism is depends on a trust module on each node, which is based on the reputation value computed for that node by its neighbors. The reputation value of a node is computed based on its packet forwarding behavior in the network. The reputation information is gathered, stored and exchanged between the nodes, and computed under different scenario. The proposed pro-tocol has been simulated in a network simulator. The simulation results show the efficiency of its performance.",

For large enough $L$, communication complexity of the proposed algorithm approaches $O(nL)$ bits. In other words, for large $L$, the communication complexity is linear in the number of processors in the network. This is an improvement over the work of Fitzi and Hirt (from PODC 2006), who proposed a probabilistically correct multi-valued Byzantine consensus algorithm with a similar complexity for large $L$. In contrast to the algorithm by Fitzi and Hirt, our algorithm is guaranteed to be always error-free. Our algorithm require no cryptographic technique, such as authentication, nor any secret sharing mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that, for large $L$, error-free multi-valued Byzantine consensus on an $L$-bit value is achievable with $O(nL)$ bits of communication.",

This method utilizes the codebook partition technique in which the watermark bit is embedded into the selected VQ encoded block. The main feature of this scheme is that the watermark exists both in VQ compressed image and in the reconstructed image. The watermark extraction can be performed without the original image. The watermark is hidden inside the compressed image, so much transmission time and storage space can be saved when the compressed data are transmitted over the Internet. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has robustness against various image processing operations without sacrificing compression performance and the computational speed.",

This implementation contains operations to create and manipulate entities of the data model, supports authentication, authorization, session handling, and the composition of individual operations to user processes. Furthermore, the implementation ensures the consistency of the database w.r.t. the data dependencies specified in the ER model, i.e., updates initiated by the user cannot lead to an inconsistent state of the database. In order to generate a high-level declarative implementation that can be easily adapted to individual customer requirements, the framework exploits previous works on declarative database programming and web user interface construction in Curry.",

The core idea of our method is to split a long and secure password into two components. The first component is memorized by the user. The second component is transformed into a CAPTCHA image and then protected using evolution of a two-dimensional dynamical system close to a phase transition, in such a way that standard brute-force attacks become ineffective. We expect our approach to have wide applications for authentication and encryption technologies.",

In the second group, one focuses on equivalence properties such as privacy and guessing attacks, and provides decision procedures for the existence of attacks for an offline attacker. In all cases the attacker is modeled by a deduction system in which his possible actions are expressed. We present in this paper a notion of finitary deduction systems that aims at relating both approaches. We prove that for such deduction systems, deciding equivalence properties for on-line attackers can be reduced to deciding reachability properties in the same setting.",

In recent works camera characteristics consistency across the image has been used to establish the authenticity and integrity of digital images. Such constant camera characteristic properties are inherent from camera manufacturing processes and are unique. The majority of digital cameras are equipped with spherical lens and this introduces radial distortions on images. This aberration is often disturbed and fails to be consistent across the image, when an image is spliced. This paper describes the detection of splicing operation on images by estimating radial distortion from different portions of the image using line-based calibration. For the first time, the detection of image splicing through the verification of consistency of lens radial distortion has been explored in this paper. The conducted experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach for the detection of image splicing on both synthetic and real images.",

We learn a classifier that can recognize six basic emotions with an average accuracy of 77% over the Cohn-Kanade database. The novelty of this work is that instead of empirically selecting the parameters of the neural network, i.e. the learning rate, activation function parameter, momentum number, the number of nodes in one layer, etc. we developed a strategy that can automatically select comparatively better combination of these parameters. We also introduce another way to perform back propagation. Instead of using the partial differential of the error function, we use optimal algorithm; namely Powell's direction set to minimize the error function. We were also interested in construction an authentic emotion databases. This is a very important task because nowadays there is no such database available. Finally, we perform several experiments and show that our neural network approach can be successfully used for emotion recognition.",

Different protocols have been developed throughout the last years to achieve this service. However, research primarily focused on correctness, efficiency and scalability; much less attention has been given to the security issues. The lack of security in the design of such protocols opens the possibility of many real threats leading to serious attacks in potentially hostile environments. Recently, few schemes have been proposed to solve this problem, but none of them has brought satisfactory solutions. Auto-configuration security issues are still an open problem. In this paper, a robust and secure stateful IP address allocation protocol for standalone MANETs is specified and evaluated within NS2. Our solution is based on mutual authentication, and a fully distributed Autoconfiguration and CA model, in conjunction with threshold cryptography. By deploying a new concept of joint IP address and public key certificate, we show that, instead of earlier approaches, our solution solves the problem of all possible attacks associated with dynamic IP address assignment in MANETs.

    "abstract": "Biometric authentication systems that make use of signature verification methods often render optimum performance only under limited and restricted conditions. Such methods utilize several training samples so as to achieve high accuracy. Moreover, several constraints are imposed on the end-user so that the system may work optimally, and as expected. For example, the user is made to sign within a small box, in order to limit their signature to a predefined set of dimensions, thus eliminating scaling. Moreover, the angular rotation with respect to the referenced signature that will be inadvertently introduced as human error, hampers performance of biometric signature verification systems. To eliminate this, traditionally, a user is asked to sign exactly on top of a reference line. In this paper, we propose a robust system that optimizes the signature obtained from the user for a large range of variation in Rotation-Scaling-Translation (RST) and resolves these error parameters in the user signature according to the reference signature stored in the database.",

    "abstract": "This paper puts forward a safe mechanism of data transmission to tackle the security problem of information which is transmitted in Internet. The encryption standards such as DES (Data Encryption Standard), AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and EES (Escrowed Encryption Standard) are widely used to solve the problem of communication over an insecure channel. With advanced technologies in computer hardware and software, these standards seem not to be as secure and fast as one would like. In this paper we propose a encryption technique which provides security to both the message and the secret key achieving confidentiality and authentication. The Symmetric algorithm used has two advantages over traditional schemes. First, the encryption and decryption procedures are much simpler, and consequently, much faster. Second, the security level is higher due to the inherent poly-alphabetic nature of the substitution mapping method used here, together with the translation and transposition operations performed in the algorithm. Asymmetric algorithm RSA is worldwide known for its high security. In this paper a detailed report of the process is presented and analysis is done comparing our proposed technique with familiar techniques",

The face image obtained from the user is cropped such that only the frontal face image is extracted, eliminating the background. The image is restricted to a size of 128 x 128 pixels. All images in the database are gray level images. DCT is applied to the entire image. This gives DCT coefficients, which are global features. Local features such as eyes, nose and mouth are also extracted and DCT is applied to these features. Depending upon the recognition rate obtained for each feature, they are given weightage and then combined. Both local and global features are used for comparison. By comparing the ranks for global and local features, the false acceptance rate for DCT can be minimized.",

However, the question of grid security remains one of the important open research issues. Here, we present some novel ideas about how to implement grid security, without appreciable performance degradation in grids.

We propose DECENT, an architecture for OSNs that uses a distributed hash table to store user data, and features cryptographic protections for confidentiality and integrity, as well as support for flexible attribute policies and fast revocation. DECENT ensures that neither data nor social relationships are visible to unauthorized users and provides availability through replication and authentication of updates.

Recently, the wireless LAN systems are spaciously deployed for public Internet services. In public wireless LAN systems, reliable user authentication and mobility support are indispensable issues. When a mobile device budges out the range of one access point (AP) and endeavor to connect to new AP, it performs handoff. Contemporarily, PNC and SNC were proposed to propagate the MN context to the entire neighboring AP's on the wireless network with the help of neighbor graph. In this paper, we proposed a non-overlapping AP's caching scheme (NACS), which propagates the mobile node context to those AP's which do not overlap with the current AP. To capture the topology of non-overlapping AP's in the wireless network, non-overlapping graph (NOG) is generated at each AP. Simulation results shows that NACS reduces the signaling cost of propagating the MN context to the neighbor AP's in the wireless network.",

The objective of this paper is to provide criteria for the unique identification of some important kinds of information objects, independent from the kind of carrier or specific encoding. Our approach is based on the idea that the substance of some kinds of information objects can completely be described in terms of discrete arrangements of finite numbers of known kinds of symbols, such as those implied by style guides for scientific journal submissions. Our theory is also useful for selecting or describing what has to be preserved. This is a fundamental problem since curators and archivists would like to formally record the decisions of what has to be preserved over time and to decide (or verify) whether a migration (transformation) preserves the intended information content. Furthermore, it is important for reasoning about the authenticity of digital objects, as well as for reducing the cost of digital preservation.",

    "abstract": "A wide variety of smartphone applications today rely on third-party advertising services, which provide libraries that are linked into the hosting application. This situation is undesirable for both the application author and the advertiser. Advertising libraries require additional permissions, resulting in additional permission requests to users. Likewise, a malicious application could simulate the behavior of the advertising library, forging the user's interaction and effectively stealing money from the advertiser. This paper describes AdSplit, where we extended Android to allow an application and its advertising to run as separate processes, under separate user-ids, eliminating the need for applications to request permissions on behalf of their advertising libraries. We also leverage mechanisms from Quire to allow the remote server to validate the authenticity of client-side behavior. In this paper, we quantify the degree of permission bloat caused by advertising, with a study of thousands of downloaded apps. AdSplit automatically recompiles apps to extract their ad services, and we measure minimal runtime overhead. We also observe that most ad libraries just embed an HTML widget within and describe how AdSplit can be designed with this in mind to avoid any need for ads to have native code.",

However, our passive attack on this protocol shows that any legitimate owner which has been the owner of a specific tag is able to trace it either in the past or in the future. Tracing the tag is also possible via an active attack for any adversary who is able to tamper the tag and extract its information. The second protocol called, Chen et al.'s protocol, is an ownership transfer protocol for passive RFID tags which conforms EPC Class1 Generation2 standard. Our attack on this protocol shows that the previous owners of a particular tag are able to trace it in future. Furthermore, they are able even to obtain the tag's secret information at any time in the future which makes them capable of impersonating the tag.",

A legitimate user entering his password only needs to carefully study the sequence of code that describe his password, and then enter these code in place of his actual password characters. This approach does not require the input code to be hidden from anyone or converted to placeholder characters for security reasons. Our solution engine regenerates new code for each character each time the carriage return key is struck, producing a hardened password that is convincingly more secure than conventional password entry system against both online and offline attackers. Using empirical data and a prototype implementation of our scheme, we give evidence that our approach is viable in practice, in terms of ease of use, improved security, and performance.",

While in human-life, trust usually has some kind of commonly understood meaning, in the realm of computing and communications systems, it could be interpreted differently in different environments and settings. On the other hand, security is about making sure that the participating entities are legitimate in a communication event or incident so that the core requirements of privacy, integrity, and authenticity are maintained. This notion is also true for our human life, even for example entering a house needs legitimacy of a person. Some boundary lines preserve the security; otherwise an unwanted access is called a 'security breach'. The intent of this article is to compare and discuss these two terms with our societal behavior and understanding amongst entities. To illustrate these issues especially in computing and communications world, some of the innovating and recent technologies are discussed which demand trust and security within their core operational structures. Alongside presenting generally established ideas, some critical points are mentioned that may be sometimes debatable within the research community.",

Without the assurance of a higher degree of trust relationship, competent resource selection and utilization cannot be achieved. In this paper we proposed an approach which is providing reliability and reputation aware security for resource selection in grid environment. In this approach, the self-protection capability and reputation weightage is utilized to obtain the Reliability Factor (RF) value. Therefore jobs are allocated to the resources that posses higher RF values. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that as higher trust and reliable nodes are selected the chances of failure decreased drastically.",

In this paper, we are interested in score level fusion functions application (i.e., we use a multibiometric authentication scheme which accept or deny the claimant for using an application). In the state of the art, the weighted sum of scores (which is a linear classifier) and the use of an SVM (which is a non linear classifier) provided by different biometric systems provide one of the best performances.

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of internet technology, easy transfer of digital multimedia is feasible. However, this kind of convenience with which authorized users can access information, turns out to be a mixed blessing due to information piracy. The emerging field of Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems addresses issues related to the intellectual property rights of digital content. In this paper, an object-oriented (OO) DRM system, called \"Imaging System with Watermarking and Attack Resilience\" (ISWAR), is presented that generates and authenticates color images with embedded mechanisms for protection against infringement of ownership rights as well as security attacks. In addition to the methods, in the object-oriented sense, for performing traditional encryption and decryption, the system implements methods for visible and invisible watermarking. This paper presents one visible and one invisible watermarking algorithm that have been integrated in the system. The qualitative and quantitative results obtained for these two watermarking algorithms with several benchmark images indicate that high-quality watermarked images are produced by the algorithms. With the help of experimental results it is demonstrated that the presented invisible watermarking techniques are resilient to the well known benchmark attacks and hence a fail-safe method for providing constant protection to ownership rights.",

    "abstract": "Information-centric networking proposals attract much attention in the ongoing search for a future communication paradigm of the Internet. Replacing the host-to-host connectivity by a data-oriented publish/subscribe service eases content distribution and authentication by concept, while eliminating threats from unwanted traffic at an end host as are common in today's Internet. However, current approaches to content routing heavily rely on data-driven protocol events and thereby introduce a strong coupling of the control to the data plane in the underlying routing infrastructure. In this paper, threats to the stability and security of the content distribution system are analyzed in theory and practical experiments. We derive relations between state resources and the performance of routers and demonstrate how this coupling can be misused in practice. We discuss new attack vectors present in its current state of development, as well as possibilities and limitations to mitigate them.",

    "abstract": "Information security is protecting information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal and destruction. CAIN model suggest maintaining the Confidentiality, Authenticity, Integrity and Non-repudiation (CAIN) of information. Oracle 8i, 9i and 11g Databases support SQLJ framework allowing embedding of SQL statements in Java Programs and providing programmer friendly means to access the Oracle database. As cloud computing technology is becoming popular, SQLJ is considered as a flexible and user friendly language for developing distributed applications in grid architectures. SQLJ source codes are translated to java byte codes and decompilation is generation of source codes from intermediate byte codes. The intermediate SQLJ application byte codes are open to decompilation, allowing a malicious reader to forcefully decompile it for understanding confidential business logic or data from the codes. To the best of our knowledge, strong and cost effective techniques exist for Oracle Database security, but still data security techniques are lacking for client side applications, giving possibility for revelation of confidential business data. Data obfuscation is hiding the data in codes and we suggest enhancing the data security in SQLJ source codes by data hiding, to mitigate disclosure of confidential business data, especially integers in distributed applications.",

On the theoretical side, relying on an existence result for $t$-designs by Teirlinck, our construction method constructively generates systems that can reach an arbitrary high level of security. On the practical side, we obtain, via cyclic difference families, very efficient constructions of new optimal systems that are onefold secure against spoofing. Moreover, we construct, by means of $t$-designs for large values of $t$, the first near-optimal systems that are 5- and 6-fold secure as well as further systems with a feasible number of keys that are 7-fold secure against spoofing. We apply our results furthermore to a recently extended authentication model, where the opponent has access to a verification oracle. We obtain this way novel perfect secrecy systems with immunity to spoofing in the verification oracle model.",

This adopting process uses a pseudo-random number generator to determine the pixel to be used on a given key. After converting the host image to YUV color space and then wavelet decomposition of Y channel, this adopted watermark is embedded into the selected subbands coefficients of Y channel using the correlation properties of additive pseudo- random noise patterns. The experimental results show that the proposed approach provides extra imperceptibility, security and robustness against JPEG compression and different noises attacks compared to the similar proposed methods.

A blind watermark retrieval technique that can detect the embedded watermark without the help from the original uncorrupted image is devised which is computationally efficient.

In the proposed approach, the host image is converted into the YCbCr color space and then its Y channel decomposed into wavelet coefficients. The selected approximation coefficients are quantized and then their four least significant bits of the quantized coefficients are replaced by the watermark using LSB insertion technique. At last, the watermarked image is synthesized from the changed and unchanged DWT coefficients.

Authenticated vulnerability scanners and validation tools represent a means to detect security vulnerabilities caused by missing patches or misconfiguration, but current approaches center much around the concepts of hosts and operating systems. This paper presents a language and an approach for the declarative specification and execution of machine-readable security checks for sets of more fine-granular system components depending on each other in a distributed environment. Such a language, building on existing standards, fosters the creation and sharing of security content among security stakeholders. Our approach is exemplified by vulnerabilities of and corresponding checks for Open Source Software commonly used in today's Internet applications.",

Such systems can be inefficient by including too many impostor's samples or skipping too many genuine's samples. In the first case, the biometric reference drifts from the real biometric data and attracts more often impostors. In the second case, the biometric reference does not evolve quickly enough and also progressively drifts from the real biometric data. We propose a hybrid system using several biometric sub-references in order to increase per- formance of self-update systems by reducing the previously cited errors. The proposition is validated for a keystroke- dynamics authentication system (this modality suffers of high variability over time) on two consequent datasets from the state of the art.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the increased use of battery-powered mobile appliances and the urge to access time-sensitive data anytime anywhere has fuelled a high demand for wireless networks. However, wireless networks are susceptible to intrusion and security problems. There is an inherent need to secure the wireless data communication to ensure the confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and non repudiation of the data being exchanged. On the other hand, the computation and the resultant energy consumption to achieve sufficient security can be high. Encryption algorithms are generally computationally intensive, and consume a significant amount of computing resources (such as CPU time, memory, and battery power). Considering the limited resources on wireless devices, it is crucial that security protocols be implemented efficiently. This manuscript focuses on how energy consumption is impacted by the use of unoptimised AES-CCMP algorithms and proposes an optimized AES CCMP algorithm using 2-way interleaving that does not compromise the security of wireless communication sessions. There is also analysis of the performance of AES (a.k.a. Rijndael) in its AES-CCMP implementation. The 2-way interleaving technique is an optimization of the CBC-MAC that is investigated using two performance metrics (namely encryption time and throughput).",

Biometric identification is a technology which uses several image processing techniques and describes the general procedure for identification and verification using feature extraction, storage and matching from the digitized image of biometric characters such as Finger Print, Face, Iris or Palm Print. The current paper uses palm print biometrics. Here we have presented an identification approach using textural properties of palm print images. The elegance of the method is that the conventional edge detection technique is extended to suitably describe the texture features. In this technique all the characteristics of the palm such as principal lines, edges and wrinkles are considered with equal importance.",

    "abstract": "In Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) systems, key revocation is non-trivial. This is because a user's identity is itself a public key. Moreover, the private key corresponding to the identity needs to be obtained from a trusted key authority through an authenticated and secrecy protected channel. So far, there exist only a very small number of revocable IBE (RIBE) schemes that support non-interactive key revocation, in the sense that the user is not required to interact with the key authority or some kind of trusted hardware to renew her private key without changing her public key (or identity). These schemes are either proven to be only selectively secure or have public parameters which grow linearly in a given security parameter. In this paper, we present two constructions of non-interactive RIBE that satisfy all the following three attractive properties: (i) proven to be adaptively secure under the Symmetric External Diffie-Hellman (SXDH) and the Decisional Linear (DLIN) assumptions; (ii) have constant-size public parameters; and (iii) preserve the anonymity of ciphertexts---a property that has not yet been achieved in all the current schemes.",

Many cryptographic protocols have been proposed to address the various security requirements of these electronic transactions, in particular to ensure privacy. Brandt developed a protocol that computes the winner using homomorphic operations on a distributed ElGamal encryption of the bids. He claimed that it ensures full privacy of the bidders, i.e. no information apart from the winner and the winning price is leaked. We first show that this protocol -- when using malleable interactive zero-knowledge proofs -- is vulnerable to attacks by dishonest bidders. Such bidders can manipulate the publicly available data in a way that allows the seller to deduce all participants' bids. Additionally we discuss some issues with verifiability as well as attacks on non-repudiation, fairness and the privacy of individual bidders exploiting authentication problems.",

In this research, a GMM model was trained, using Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, on a dataset containing 10 classes of vowels and the model was used to predict the appropriate classes using a validation dataset. For experimental validity, the model was compared to the performance of two different versions of RBF model using the same learning and validation datasets. The results showed very close recognition accuracy between the GMM and the standard RBF model, but with GMM performing better than the standard RBF by less than 1% and the two models outperformed similar models reported in literature. The DTREG version of RBF outperformed the other two models by producing 94.8% recognition accuracy. In terms of recognition time, the standard RBF was found to be the fastest among the three models.",

    "abstract": "We propose an electronic payment protocol for typical customer-merchant relations which does not require a trusted (signed) payment descriptor to be sent from the merchant to the customer. Instead, the destination \"account\" number for the payment is solely created on the customer side. This eliminates the need for any encrypted or authenticated communication in the protocol and is secure even if the merchant's online infrastructure is compromised. Moreover, the payment transaction itself serves as a timestamped receipt for the customer. It proves what has been paid for and who received the funds, again without relying on any merchant signatures. In particular, funds and receipt are exchanged in a single atomic action. The asymmetric nature of the customer-merchant relation is crucial. The protocol is specifically designed with bitcoin in mind as the underlying payment system. Thereby, it has the useful benefit that all transactions are public. However, the only essential requirement on the payment system is that \"accounts\" are arbitrary user-created keypairs of a cryptosystem whose keypairs enjoy a homomorphic property. All ElGamal-type cryptosystems have this feature. For use with bitcoin we propose the design of a deterministic bitcoin wallet whose addresses can be indexed by clear text strings.",

PoWerStore's efficiency stems from combining lightweight authentication, erasure coding and metadata write-backs where readers write-back only metadata to achieve linearizability. At the heart of PoWerStore are Proofs of Writing (PoW): a novel storage technique based on lightweight cryptography. PoW enable reads and writes in the single-writer variant of PoWerStore to have latency of 2 rounds of communication between a client and storage servers in the worst-case (which we show optimal). We further present and implement a multi-writer PoWerStore variant featuring 3-round writes/reads where the third read round is invoked only under active attacks, and show that it outperforms existing robust storage protocols, including crash-tolerant ones.",

Most attempts to solve this problem, proposing formal description languages for Web service APIs, have had limited success outside of B2B applications; we believe it is due to their top-down nature. In addition, a programmer dealing with one or several of these APIs has to deal with a number of related tasks such as data integration, requests chaining, or policy management, that are cumbersome to implement. Inspired by the SPORE project, we present API Blender, an open-source solution to describe, interact with, and integrate the most common social Web APIs. In this perspective, we first introduce two new lightweight description formats for requests and services and demonstrate their relevance with respect to current platform APIs. We present our Python implementation of API Blender and its features regarding authentication, policy management and multi-platform data integration.",

Logging safely requires to design a secure Human Computer Interface (HCI) robust to those attacks. We describe a novel method and system based on entering secret ID passwords by means of associative secret UI passwords that provides zero-knowledge to observers.

    "abstract": "We investigate implementations of biometric cryptosystems protecting fingerprint templates (which are mostly based on the fuzzy vault scheme by Juels and Sudan in 2002) with respect to the security they provide. We show that attacks taking advantage of the system's false acceptance rate, i.e. false-accept attacks, pose a very serious risk --- even if brute-force attacks are impractical to perform. Our observations lead to the clear conclusion that currently a single fingerprint is not sufficient to provide a secure biometric cryptosystem. But there remain other problems that can not be resolved by merely switching to multi-finger: Kholmatov and Yanikoglu in 2007 demonstrated that it is possible to break two matching vault records at quite a high rate via the correlation attack. We propose an implementation of a minutiae fuzzy vault that is inherently resistant against cross-matching and the correlation attack. Surprisingly, achieving cross-matching resistance is not at the cost of authentication performance. In particular, we propose to use a randomized decoding procedure and find that it is possible to achieve a GAR=91% at which no false accepts are observed on a database generally used. Our ideas can be adopted into an implementation of a multibiometric cryptosystem. All experiments described in this paper can fully be reproduced using software available for download.",

A different logarithmic approach is proposed. In this regard a logarithmic function is first applied to watermark data.

There are always slight variations among the measurements of a given biometric, and, unlike passwords or identification numbers, biometrics are derived from physical characteristics that cannot easily be changed. The proliferation of biometric usage raises critical privacy and security concerns that, due to the noisy nature of biometrics, cannot be addressed using standard cryptographic methods.

There have been some graphical schemes resistant or immune to shoulder-surfing, but they have significant usability drawbacks, usually in the time and effort to log in. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new shoulder-surfing resistant scheme which has a desirable usability for PDAs. Our inspiration comes from the drawing input method in DAS and the association mnemonics in Story for sequence retrieval. The new scheme requires users to draw a curve across their password images orderly rather than click directly on them. The drawing input trick along with the complementary measures, such as erasing the drawing trace, displaying degraded images, and starting and ending with randomly designated images provide a good resistance to shouldersurfing. A preliminary user study showed that users were able to enter their passwords accurately and to remember them over time.",

In this work, we present \\ourprotocoltight, a framework to authenticate users silently and transparently by exploiting dynamics mined from the user touch behavior biometrics and the micro-movement of the device caused by user's screen-touch actions. We build a \"touch-based biometrics\" model of the owner by extracting some principle features, and then verify whether the current user is the owner or guest/attacker. When using the smartphone, the unique operating dynamics of the user is detected and learnt by collecting the sensor data and touch events silently. When users are mobile, the micro-movement of mobile devices caused by touch is suppressed by that due to the large scale user-movement which will render the touch-based biometrics ineffective. To address this, we integrate a movement-based biometrics for each user with previous touch-based biometrics. We conduct extensive evaluations of our approaches on the Android smartphone, we show that the user identification accuracy is over 99%.",

    "abstract": "The ability to automatically detect fraudulent escrow websites is important in order to alleviate online auction fraud. Despite research on related topics, fake escrow website categorization has received little attention. In this study we evaluated the effectiveness of various features and techniques for detecting fake escrow websites. Our analysis included a rich set of features extracted from web page text, image, and link information. We also proposed a composite kernel tailored to represent the properties of fake websites, including content duplication and structural attributes. Experiments were conducted to assess the proposed features, techniques, and kernels on a test bed encompassing nearly 90,000 web pages derived from 410 legitimate and fake escrow sites. The combination of an extended feature set and the composite kernel attained over 98% accuracy when differentiating fake sites from real ones, using the support vector machines algorithm. The results suggest that automated web-based information systems for detecting fake escrow sites could be feasible and may be utilized as authentication mechanisms.",

In this paper, suggested data encryption technique is presented by using the MAC address as a key that is used to authenticate the receiver device like PC, mobile phone, laptop or any other devices that is connected to the network. This technique was tested on some data, visual and numerical measurements were used to check the strength and performance of the technique.

By leveraging from existing and proven technologies, twister provides a new microblogging platform offering security, scalability and privacy features.

Because the problem of cancelable template generation deals with the trade-off between template security and matching performance, many state-of-the-art algorithms successful in generating high quality cancelable biometrics all have random projection as one of their early processing steps. This paper therefore presents a formal analysis of why random projections is an essential step in cancelable biometrics. By formally defining the notion of an \\textit{Independent Subspace Structure} for datasets, it can be shown that random projection preserves the subspace structure of data vectors generated from a union of independent linear subspaces. The bound on the minimum number of random vectors required for this to hold is also derived and is shown to depend logarithmically on the number of data samples, not only in independent subspaces but in disjoint subspace settings as well. The theoretical analysis presented is supported in detail with empirical results on real-world face recognition datasets.",

Other reasons include business owners becoming increasingly aware of confidentiality risks that go beyond traditional information security, e.g., the numbers of authentications to an EDI service might provide insights into the volume of invoices, from which one could derive insider information. This paper proposes extended technical controls supporting three privacy requirements: a) Limit d Linkability: Two service providers cannot link data related to a user without the help of a third party, using neither an identifier nor other identifying attributes like email addresses or payment data; b) Limited Observability: An identity provider cannot trace which services a user is using without the help of a third party; c) Non-Disclosure: Attributes provided to the service provider by an attribute provider are not disclosed to the identity provider or an intermediate service broker. Using a hub-and-spoke federation style following the privacy-by-design principle, this reference architecture addresses the privacy controls mentioned above.",

Here each node has an ID which is evaluated from its public key and the messages that are sent are authenticated with a signature/ MAC.

    "abstract": "Text-based passwords continue to be the prime form of authentication to computer systems. Today, they are increasingly created and used with mobile text entry methods, such as touchscreens and mobile keyboards, in addition to traditional physical keyboards. This raises a foundational question for usable security: whether text entry methods affect password generation and password security. This paper presents results from a between-group study with 63 participants, in which each group generated passwords for multiple virtual accounts using a different text entry method. Participants were also asked to recall their passwords afterwards. We applied analysis of structures and probabilities, with standard and recent security metrics and also performed cracking attacks on the collected data. The results show a significant effect of text entry methods on passwords. In particular, one of the experimental groups created passwords with significantly more lowercase letters per password than the control group ($t(60) = 2.99, p = 0.004$). The choices for character types in each group were also significantly different ($p=0.048, FET$). Our cracking attacks consequently expose significantly different resistance across groups ($p=0.031, FET$) and text entry method vulnerabilities. Our findings contribute to the understanding of password security in the context of usable interfaces.",

We compare the browser extension mechanism among various browsers, and try to create a set of rules to maintain the principle of least privileges in the browser. We track various plugins and determine whether the least privileges required match with the privileges asked for. We also work on a survey of extensions (for various browsers) and determine the nature of attacks possible. For eg, if a developer account gets hacked, updating of a normal extension with a malicious one is possible. We look at privilege abuse and survey extensions that ask for more privileges than they use.

During fabrication, subtle imperfections arise in device microphones and speakers which induce anomalies in produced and received sounds. We exploit this observation to fingerprint smart devices through playback and recording of audio samples. We use audio-metric tools to analyze and explore different acoustic features and analyze their ability to successfully fingerprint smart devices. Our experiments show that it is even possible to fingerprint devices that have the same vendor and model; we were able to accurately distinguish over 93% of all recorded audio clips from 15 different units of the same model. Our study identifies the prominent acoustic features capable of fingerprinting devices with high success rate and examines the effect of background noise and other variables on fingerprinting accuracy.",

Because of NDN's fundamental requirement that each content object must be signed by its producer, fragmentation has been considered incompatible with NDN since it precludes authentication of individual content fragments by routers. The alternative is to perform hop-by-hop reassembly, which incurs prohibitive delays. In this paper, we show that secure and efficient content fragmentation is both possible and even advantageous in NDN and similar content-centric network architectures that involve signed content. We design a concrete technique that facilitates efficient and secure content fragmentation in NDN, discuss its security guarantees and assess performance.

Both frauds aim at passing an authentication protocol by cheating on the actual distance between the prover and the verifier. To cope these security issues, distance-bounding protocols have been designed. However, none of the current proposals simultaneously resists to these two frauds without requiring additional memory and computation. The situation is even worse considering that just a few distance-bounding protocols are able to deal with the inherent background noise on the communication channels. This article introduces a noise-resilient distance-bounding protocol that resists to both mafia and distance frauds. The security of the protocol is analyzed with respect to these two frauds in both scenarios, namely noisy and noiseless channels. Analytical expressions for the adversary's success probabilities are provided, and are illustrated by experimental results. The analysis, performed in an already existing framework for fairness reasons, demonstrates the undeniable advantage of the introduced lightweight design over the previous proposals.",

    "abstract": "Traditional cryptography-based security mechanisms such as authentication and authorization are not effective against insider attacks like wormhole, sinkhole, selective forwarding attacks, etc., Trust based approaches have been widely used to counter insider attacks in wireless sensor networks. It provides a quantitative way to evaluate the trustworthiness of sensor nodes. An untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely affect the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analysing the trust level of a node is important. In this paper we focused about indirect trust mechanism, in which each node monitors the forwarding behavior of its neighbors in order to detect any node that behaves selfishly and does not forward the packets it receives. For this, we used a link state routing protocol based indirect trusts which forms the shortest route and finds the best trustworthy route among them by comparing the values of all the calculated route trusts as for each route present in the network. And finally, we compare our work with similar routing protocols and show its advantages over them.",

    "abstract": "Recent Pwn2Own competitions have demonstrated the continued effectiveness of control hijacking attacks despite deployed countermeasures including stack canaries and ASLR. A powerful defense called Control flow Integrity (CFI) offers a principled approach to preventing such attacks. However, prior CFI implementations use static analysis and must limit protection to remain practical. These limitations have enabled attacks against all known CFI systems, as demonstrated in recent work. This paper presents a cryptographic approach to control flow integrity (CCFI) that is both fine-grain and practical: using message authentication codes (MAC) to protect control flow elements such as return addresses, function pointers, and vtable pointers. MACs on these elements prevent even powerful attackers with random read/write access to memory from tampering with program control flow. We implemented CCFI in Clang/LLVM, taking advantage of recently available cryptographic CPU instructions. We evaluate our system on several large software packages (including nginx, Apache and memcache) as well as all their dependencies. The cost of protection ranges from a 3-18% decrease in request rate.",

    "abstract": "An offline signature-based fuzzy vault (OSFV) is a bio-cryptographic implementation that uses handwritten signature images as biometrics instead of traditional passwords to secure private cryptographic keys. Having a reliable OSFV implementation is the first step towards automating financial and legal authentication processes, as it provides greater security of confidential documents by means of the embedded handwritten signatures. The authors have recently proposed the first OSFV implementation which is reviewed in this paper. In this system, a machine learning approach based on the dissimilarity representation concept is employed to select a reliable feature representation adapted for the fuzzy vault scheme. Some variants of this system are proposed for enhanced accuracy and security. In particular, a new method that adapts user key size is presented. Performance of proposed methods are compared using the Brazilian PUCPR and GPDS signature databases and results indicate that the key-size adaptation method achieves a good compromise between security and accuracy. While average system entropy is increased from 45-bits to about 51-bits, the AER (average error rate) is decreased by about 21%.",

The proposed scheme works in two stages: setting the visual password stage and the verification stage. At the setting stage the visual passwords system request the user to utter a selected password, a video recording of the user face is captured, and processed by a special words-based VSR system which extracts a sequence of feature vectors. In the verification stage, the same procedure is executed, the features will be sent to be compared with the stored visual password. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using a video database of 20 different speakers (10 females and 10 males), and 15 more males in another video database with different experiment sets. The evaluation has proved the system feasibility, with average error rate in the range of 7.63% to 20.51% at the worst tested scenario, and therefore, has potential to be a practical approach with the support of other conventional authentication methods such as the use of usernames and passwords.",

    "abstract": "Peer-to-Peer (P2P) botnets are becoming widely used as a low-overhead, efficient, self-maintaining, distributed alternative to the traditional client/server model across a broad range of cyberattacks. These cyberattacks can take the form of distributed denial of service attacks, authentication cracking, spamming, cyberwarfare or malware distribution targeting on financial systems. These attacks can also cross over into the physical world attacking critical infrastructure causing its disruption or destruction (power, communications, water, etc.). P2P technology lends itself well to being exploited for such malicious purposes due to the minimal setup, running and maintenance costs involved in executing a globally orchestrated attack, alongside the perceived additional layer of anonymity. In the ever-evolving space of botnet technology, reducing the time lag between discovering a newly developed or updated botnet system and gaining the ability to mitigate against it is paramount.

In this work we formally analyze, for the first time, the performance of a wireless Location Verification System (LVS) under the realistic setting of spatially correlated shadowing. Our analysis illustrates that anticipated levels of correlated shadowing can lead to a dramatic performance improvement of a Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based LVS. We also analyze the performance of an LVS that utilizes Differential Received Signal Strength (DRSS), formally proving the rather counter-intuitive result that a DRSS-based LVS has identical performance to that of an RSS-based LVS, for all levels of correlated shadowing. Even more surprisingly, the identical performance of RSS and DRSS-based LVSs is found to hold even when the adversary does not optimize his true location. Only in the case where the adversary does not optimize all variables under her control, do we find the performance of an RSS-based LVS to be better than a DRSS-based LVS. The results reported here are important for a wide range of emerging wireless communication applications whose proper functioning depends on the authenticity of the location information reported by a transceiver.",

Provenance on the other hand tracks data usage and its origin which proves the authenticity of data. To employ provenance in a real time system like cloud, the service provider needs to store metadata on the subject of data alteration which is universally called as the Provenance Information.

By evaluating false match, false non-match and clone-resistance rates, we clarify that the nanostructured patterns based on resist collapse satisfy the requirements for high-performance security applications.",

    "abstract": "Cloud services have turned remote computation into a commodity and enable convenient online collaboration. However, they require that clients fully trust the service provider in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Towards reducing this dependency, this paper introduces a protocol for verification of integrity and consistency for cloud object storage (VICOS), which enables a group of mutually trusting clients to detect data-integrity and consistency violations for a cloud object-storage service. It aims at services where multiple clients cooperate on data stored remotely on a potentially misbehaving service. VICOS enforces the consistency notion of fork-linearizability, supports wait-free client semantics for most operations, and reduces the computation and communication overhead compared to previous protocols. VICOS is based in a generic way on any authenticated data structure. Moreover, its operations cover the hierarchical name space of a cloud object store, supporting a real-world interface and not only a simplistic abstraction. A prototype of VICOS that works with the key-value store interface of commodity cloud storage services has been implemented, and an evaluation demonstrates its advantage compared to existing systems.",

We investigate the feasibility of this approach with CuedR, a novel cued-recognition authentication scheme that provides users with multiple cues (visual, verbal, and spatial) and lets them choose the cues that best fit their learning process for later recognition of system-assigned keywords. In our lab study, all 37 of our participants could log in within three attempts one week after registration (mean login time: 38.0 seconds). A pilot study on using multiple CuedR passwords also showed 100% recall within three attempts.

A number of possible modifications to 2G, 3G and 4G protocols have been proposed designed to provide greater user privacy; however, they all require significant modifications to existing deployed infrastructures, which are almost certainly impractical to achieve in practice. In this article we propose an approach which does not require any changes to the existing deployed network infrastructures or mobile devices, but offers improved user identity protection over the air interface. The proposed scheme makes use of multiple IMSIs for an individual USIM to offer a degree of pseudonymity for a user. The only changes required are to the operation of the authentication centre in the home network and to the USIM, and the scheme could be deployed immediately since it is completely transparent to the existing mobile telephony infrastructure. We present two different approaches to the use and management of multiple IMSIs.",

Specifically, we define in an interacting program model what it means for a set of program actions to be an actual cause of a violation. We present a sound technique for establishing program actions as actual causes. We demonstrate the value of this formalism in two ways. First, we prove that violations of a specific class of safety properties always have an actual cause. Thus, our definition applies to relevant security properties.

    "abstract": "As ATM applications deploy for a banking system, the need to secure communications will become critical. However, multicast protocols do not fit the point-to-point model of most network security protocols which were designed with unicast communications in mind. In recent years, we have seen the emergence and the growing of ATMs (Automatic Teller Machines) in banking systems. Many banks are extending their activity and increasing transactions by using ATMs. ATM will allow them to reach more customers in a cost effective way and to make their transactions fast and efficient. However, communicating in the network must satisfy integrity, privacy, confidentiality, authentication and non-repudiation. Many frameworks have been implemented to provide security in communication and transactions. In this paper, we analyze ATM communication protocol and propose a novel framework for ATM systems that allows entities communicate in a secure way without using a lot of storage. We describe the architecture and operation of SFAMSS in detail. Our framework is implemented with Java and the software architecture, and its components are studied in detailed.",

Its purpose is to securely communicate to a group of online friends while bypassing their respective social networking servers under a mobile ad hoc network environment. DiscoverFriends leverages Bloom filters and a hybrid encryption technique with a self-organized public-key management scheme to securely identify friends and provide authentication. Additionally, DiscoverFriends enables anonymous location check-ins by utilizing a new cryptographic primitive called Function Secret Sharing. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, DiscoverFriends implements and evaluates the first Android multi-hop WiFi direct protocol using IPv6.",

Further security related challenges arise from the integration of millions of smart homes into the smart grid. This paper gives an overview of the smart energy grid environment and its challenges. Many future use cases are centered around the smart home, using an ICT gateway. Approaches to protect the access and data exchange are described, preventing manipulation of ICT gateway operation.

    "abstract": "Devices equipped with accelerometer sensors such as today's mobile devices can make use of motion to exchange information. A typical example for shared motion is shaking of two devices which are held together in one hand. Deriving a shared secret (key) from shared motion, e.g. for device pairing, is an obvious application for this. Only the keys need to be exchanged between the peers and neither the motion data nor the features extracted from it. This makes the pairing fast and easy. For this, each device generates an information signal (key) independently of each other and, in order to pair, they should be identical. The key is essentially derived by quantizing certain well discriminative features extracted from the accelerometer data after an implicit synchronization. In this paper, we aim at finding a small set of effective features which enable a significantly simpler quantization procedure than the prior art. Our tentative results with authentic accelerometer data show that this is possible with a competent accuracy ($76$%) and key strength (entropy approximately $15$ bits).",

    "abstract": "Many millions of users routinely use their Google accounts to log in to relying party (RP) websites supporting the Google OpenID Connect service. OpenID Connect, a newly standardised single-sign-on protocol, builds an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which has itself been widely adopted to support identity management services. It adds identity management functionality to the OAuth 2.0 system and allows an RP to obtain assurances regarding the authenticity of an end user. A number of authors have analysed the security of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, but whether OpenID Connect is secure in practice remains an open question. We report on a large-scale practical study of Google's implementation of OpenID Connect, involving forensic examination of 103 RP websites which support its use for sign-in. Our study reveals serious vulnerabilities of a number of types, all of which allow an attacker to log in to an RP website as a victim user. Further examination suggests that these vulnerabilities are caused by a combination of Google's design of its OpenID Connect service and RP developers making design decisions which sacrifice security for simplicity of implementation. We also give practical recommendations for both RPs and OPs to help improve the security of real world OpenID Connect systems.",

A key feature of DeepWriterID is a new method we are proposing, called DropSegment. It designs to achieve data augmentation and improve the generalized applicability of CNN. For sufficient feature representation, we further introduce path signature feature maps to improve performance. Experiments were conducted on the NLPR handwriting database.

Second, based on these capabilities, we show that an attacker who can manipulate the context gains a significant advantage in defeating context-based co-presence detection. For systems that use multiple sensors, we investigate two sensor fusion approaches based on machine learning techniques: features-fusion and decisions-fusion, and show that both are vulnerable to contextual attacks but the latter approach can be more resistant in some cases.",

It also displays a 'user-browser' shared secret i.e. a specific picture from your hard disk. This is not SiteKey, the image is shared between the computer user and their browser. It is never transmitted over the internet. Since sandboxed websites cannot access your hard disk this image cannot be counterfeited by phishing websites.

The output efficiency of various de-noising model proposed earlier is calculated on the basis of SNR (signal to noise ratio) and MSE (mean square error rate). Our simulated experimental results indicates that incorporating the de-noising model based on Gabor filter inside domain of wavelet ranges with composite method only betters MSE (Mean Square Error).

The mapping is robust enough to tackle the problem of exact matching, yielding the same code for new samples of a user as the code assigned during training. These codes are then hashed using any hash function that follows the random oracle model (like SHA-512) to generate protected face templates (similar to text based password protection). The algorithm makes no unrealistic assumptions and offers high template security, cancelability, and state-of-the-art matching performance. The efficacy of the approach is shown on CMU-PIE, Extended Yale B, and Multi-PIE face databases.

The endpoints of these lines are determined and a connection is created among them using the Delaunay triangulation thereby generating a distinct topological structure of each palmprint. Next, we extract different geometric as well as quantitative features from the triangles of the Delaunay triangulation that assist in identifying different individuals. To ensure that the proposed approach is invariant to rotation and scaling, features were made relative to topological and geometrical structure of the palmprint. The similarity of the two palmprints is computed using the weighted sum approach and compared with the k-nearest neighbor. The experimental results obtained reflect the effectiveness of the proposed approach to discriminate between different palmprint images and thus achieved a recognition rate of 90% over large databases.",

To gain qualitative insights into the nature of simplification at the sentence level, we studied the impact of specific linguistic features. We empirically confirm that both word-level and syntactic features play a role in comparing the degree of simplification of authentic data. To carry out this research, we created a new sentence-aligned corpus from professionally simplified news articles. The new corpus resource enriches the empirical basis of sentence-level simplification research, which so far relied on a single resource.

One method for assessing the quality or authenticity of semantic information encoded in these systems is by comparison with human judgments. A data set for evaluating semantic models was developed consisting of 775 English word-sentence pairs, each annotated for semantic relatedness by human raters engaged in a Maximum Difference Scaling (MDS) task, as well as a faster alternative task. As a sample application of this relatedness data, behavior-based relatedness was compared to the relatedness computed via four off-the-shelf STS models: n-gram, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Word2Vec, and UMBC Ebiquity. Some STS models captured much of the variance in the human judgments collected, but they were not sensitive to the implicatures and entailments that were processed and considered by the participants. All text stimuli and judgment data have been made freely available.",

Apart from being useful for individuals seeking a more healthy lifestyle, their data is also being used in court and by insurance companies to adjust premiums. For these use cases, it is essential to ensure authenticity and integrity of data. Here we demonstrate a flaw in the way firmware for Withings' Activit\\'e is verified, allowing an adversary to compromise the tracker itself. This type of attack has so far not been applied to fitness trackers. Vendors have started mitigating previous attacks, which manipulated data by interfering with wireless channels, or by physically moving the tracker to fool sensors. Hardware similarities amongst different trackers suggest findings can be transferred to other tracker as well.",

    "abstract": "MapReduce is a programming system for distributed processing large-scale data in an efficient and fault tolerant manner on a private, public, or hybrid cloud. MapReduce is extensively used daily around the world as an efficient distributed computation tool for a large class of problems, e.g., search, clustering, log analysis, different types of join operations, matrix multiplication, pattern matching, and analysis of social networks. Security and privacy of data and MapReduce computations are essential concerns when a MapReduce computation is executed in public or hybrid clouds. In order to execute a MapReduce job in public and hybrid clouds, authentication of mappers-reducers, confidentiality of data-computations, integrity of data-computations, and correctness-freshness of the outputs are required. Satisfying these requirements shield the operation from several types of attacks on data and MapReduce computations. In this paper, we investigate and discuss security and privacy challenges and requirements, considering a variety of adversarial capabilities, and characteristics in the scope of MapReduce. We also provide a review of existing security and privacy protocols for MapReduce and discuss their overhead issues.",

We present a set of relevant aspects collected based on the qualitative analysis of a smaller set of context-dependent corpus example sentences. Furthermore, we implemented a rule-based algorithm using these criteria which achieved an average precision of 0.76 for the identification of different issues related to context dependence. The method has also been evaluated empirically where 80% of the sentences in which our system did not detect context-dependent elements were also considered context-independent by human raters.",

The results suggest that: (1) the hypotheses of Constant Entropy Rate and Uniform Information Density do not hold for the sentence-medial positions; (2) the context of a word in a sentence should not be simply defined as all the words preceding it in the same sentence; and (3) the contextual information content in a sentence does not accumulate incrementally but follows a pattern of \"the whole is greater than the sum of parts\".",

Being the specialized standard of WBAN, the burgeoning IEEE 802.15.6 is on its way to refinement and perfection. Since experiments are the foundation of research in WBAN that reproduce system operating patterns, yet existing platforms in WBAN are mainly simulations that could not highly conform to reality with strict requirements to some degree. Thus, a reliable and efficient system based on the IEEE 802.15.6, named WBAN prototype system, is proposed and implemented in this paper. The prototype system is ascertained to be valid, authentic and efficient via analyses of scenario tests. Running in circumstances much closer to reality, the system obtains experimental results that meet rigid requirements preferably. Furthermore, based on the valid platform we created, optimizations of two parameters in the IEEE 802.15.6 by actual measurements are derived. We obtain an optimum number of transmission retries and relationship of payload length within 30 with FER, making a trade-off between waste of resource and high packet loss rate.",

The PUF-FSM eschews the error correction logic and the computation, storage and loading of the helper data on-chip by only employing error-free responses judiciously determined on demand in the absence of an Arbiter PUF with a large CRP space. In addition, the access to the PUF-FSM is controlled by the trusted entity. Control in means of i) restricting challenges presented to the PUF and ii) further preventing repeated response evaluations to gain unreliability side-channel information are foundations of defensing the most powerful modeling attacks.

Thus, in this work, we present MoPS, a modular protection scheme to ensure authenticity and integrity for data stored over long periods of time. MoPS does not come with any requirements regarding the storage architecture and can therefore be used together with existing archiving or storage systems. It supports a set of techniques which can be plugged together, combined, and migrated in order to create customized solutions that fulfill the requirements of different application scenarios in the best possible way. As a proof of concept we implemented MoPS and provide performance measurements. Furthermore, our implementation provides additional features, such as guidance for non-expert users and export functionalities for external verifiers.",

    "abstract": "Federated clouds raise a variety of challenges for managing identity, resource access, naming, connectivity, and object access control. This paper shows how to address these challenges in a comprehensive and uniform way using a data-centric approach. The foundation of our approach is a trust logic in which participants issue authenticated statements about principals, objects, attributes, and relationships in a logic language, with reasoning based on declarative policy rules. We show how to use the logic to implement a trust infrastructure for cloud federation that extends the model of NSF GENI, a federated IaaS testbed. It captures shared identity management, GENI authority services, cross-site interconnection using L2 circuits, and a naming and access control system similar to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), but extended to a federated system without central control.",

    "abstract": "Image splicing detection is of fundamental importance in digital forensics and therefore has attracted increasing attention recently. In this paper, a color image splicing detection approach is proposed based on Markov transition probability of quaternion component separation in quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) domain and quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) domain. Firstly, Markov features of the intra-block and inter-block between block QDCT coefficients are obtained from the real part and three imaginary parts of QDCT coefficients respectively. Then, additional Markov features are extracted from luminance (Y) channel in quaternion wavelet transform domain to characterize the dependency of position among quaternion wavelet subband coefficients. Finally, ensemble classifier (EC) is exploited to classify the spliced and authentic color images. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.",

Our work modernizes the classic S/Key system and addresses the challenges in making such a system secure and practical. At the heart of our construction is a new lower bound analyzing the hardness of inverting hash chains composed of independent random functions, which formalizes the security of this widely used primitive. Additionally, we develop a near-optimal algorithm for quickly generating the required elements in a hash chain with little memory on the client. We report on our implementation of T/Key as an Android application. T/Key can be used as a replacement for current TOTP systems, and it remains secure in the event of a server-side compromise. The cost, as with S/Key, is that one-time passwords are longer than the standard six characters used in TOTP.",

    "abstract": "Fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables computation on encrypted data while maintaining secrecy. Recent research has shown that such schemes exist even for quantum computation. Given the numerous applications of classical FHE (zero-knowledge proofs, secure two-party computation, obfuscation, etc.) it is reasonable to hope that quantum FHE (or QFHE) will lead to many new results in the quantum setting. However, a crucial ingredient in almost all applications of FHE is circuit verification. Classically, verification is performed by checking a transcript of the homomorphic computation. Quantumly, this strategy is impossible due to no-cloning. This leads to an important open question: can quantum computations be delegated and verified in a non-interactive manner? In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative, by constructing a scheme for QFHE with verification (vQFHE). Our scheme provides authenticated encryption, and enables arbitrary polynomial-time quantum computations without the need of interaction between client and server. Verification is almost entirely classical; for computations that start and end with classical states, it is completely classical. As a first application, we show how to construct quantum one-time programs from classical one-time programs and vQFHE.",

Even though passwords are usually stored in a salted hash, attackers still guess passwords because of insecure password choices and password reuse. However, the adverse effects of a password breach can be mitigated by changing users' passwords. We introduce a simple yet powerful algorithm to reset user account passwords automatically, while still allowing users to authenticate without any additional effort on their part. We implemented our algorithm as a Firefox add-on that automatically resets a user's password when they log in to their account, and stores the new password in the built-in Firefox password manager.",

    "abstract": "Pattern classification systems are commonly used in adversarial applications, like biometric authentication, network intrusion detection, and spam filtering, in which data can be purposely manipulated by humans to undermine their operation. As this adversarial scenario is not taken into account by classical design methods, pattern classification systems may exhibit vulnerabilities, whose exploitation may severely affect their performance, and consequently limit their practical utility. Extending pattern classification theory and design methods to adversarial settings is thus a novel and very relevant research direction, which has not yet been pursued in a systematic way. In this paper, we address one of the main open issues: evaluating at design phase the security of pattern classifiers, namely, the performance degradation under potential attacks they may incur during operation. We propose a framework for empirical evaluation of classifier security that formalizes and generalizes the main ideas proposed in the literature, and give examples of its use in three real applications. Reported results show that security evaluation can provide a more complete understanding of the classifier's behavior in adversarial environments, and lead to better design choices.",

Hence, we empirically investigate whether a serious game has the potential of improving the memorability of strong answers to security questions. For our serious game, we adapted the popular \"4 Pics 1 word\" mobile game because of its use of pictures and cues, which psychology research found to be important to help with memorability. Our findings indicate that the proposed serious game could potentially improve the memorability of answers to security questions. This potential improvement in memorability, could eventually help reduce the trade-off between usability and security in fall-back authentication.",

Finally, a score level classifier fusion method is used to integrate the scores obtained from the two one-class SVMs to achieve the verification score. In the proposed method only genuine signatures are used to train the one-class SVMs. The proposed signature verification method has been tested using four different publicly available datasets and the results demonstrate the generality of the proposed method.

Gaze-assisted interaction serves as a contextual, non-invasive, and explicit control method for users without disabilities; for users with motor or speech impairments, text entry by gaze serves as the primary means of communication. Despite significant advantages, gaze-assisted interaction is still not widely accepted because of its inherent limitations: 1) Midas touch, 2) low accuracy for mouse-like interactions, 3) need for repeated calibration, 4) visual fatigue with prolonged usage, 5) lower gaze typing speed, and so on. This dissertation research proposes a gaze-assisted, multimodal, interaction paradigm, and related frameworks and their applications that effectively enable gaze-assisted interactions while addressing many of the current limitations. In this regard, we present four systems that leverage gaze-assisted interaction: 1) a gaze- and foot-operated system for precise point-and-click interactions, 2) a dwell-free, foot-operated gaze typing system. 3) a gaze gesture-based authentication system, and 4) a gaze gesture-based interaction toolkit.

Numerical evaluations demonstrate that our scheme improves the imperceptibility of the watermark when the capacity remains fix, and at the same time, robustness against attacks is assured.

The network that has completed training is applied to the training data in a fully convolutional way, and the optimal threshold to distinguish fake fingerprints is determined, which is used in the final test.

We therefore study in this paper a novel problem called compressive robust subspace clustering, which is to perform robust subspace clustering with the compressed data, and which is generated by projecting the original high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace chosen at random. Given only the compressed data and sensing matrix, the proposed method, row space pursuit (RSP), recovers the authentic row space that gives correct clustering results under certain conditions. Extensive experiments show that RSP is distinctly better than the competing methods, in terms of both clustering accuracy and computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing enables users (clients) to outsource large volume of their data to cloud servers. Secure distributed cloud storage schemes ensure that multiple servers store these data in a reliable and untampered fashion. We propose an idea to construct such a scheme for static data by encoding data blocks (using error-correcting codes) and then attaching authentication information (tags) to these encoded blocks. We identify some challenges while extending this idea to accommodate append-only data. Then, we propose our secure distributed cloud storage scheme for append-only data that addresses the challenges efficiently. The main advantage of our scheme is that it enables the servers to update the parity blocks themselves. Moreover, the client need not download any data (or parity) block to update the tags of the modified parity blocks residing on the servers. Finally, we analyze the security and performance of our scheme.",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning has been applied to many security-sensitive applications, such as facial authentication. The existence of adversarial examples hinders such applications. The state-of-the-art result on defense shows that adversarial training can be applied to train a robust model on MNIST against adversarial examples; but it fails to achieve a high empirical worst-case accuracy on a more complex task, such as CIFAR-10 and SVHN. In our work, we propose curriculum adversarial training (CAT) to resolve this issue. The basic idea is to develop a curriculum of adversarial examples generated by attacks with a wide range of strengths. With two techniques to mitigate the forgetting and the generalization issues, we demonstrate that CAT can improve the prior art's empirical worst-case accuracy by a large margin of 25% on CIFAR-10 and 35% on SVHN. At the same, the model's performance on non-adversarial inputs is comparable to the state-of-the-art models.",

We propose a two-stream Faster R-CNN network and train it endto- end to detect the tampered regions given a manipulated image. One of the two streams is an RGB stream whose purpose is to extract features from the RGB image input to find tampering artifacts like strong contrast difference, unnatural tampered boundaries, and so on. The other is a noise stream that leverages the noise features extracted from a steganalysis rich model filter layer to discover the noise inconsistency between authentic and tampered regions. We then fuse features from the two streams through a bilinear pooling layer to further incorporate spatial co-occurrence of these two modalities. Experiments on four standard image manipulation datasets demonstrate that our two-stream framework outperforms each individual stream, and also achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to alternative methods with robustness to resizing and compression.",

We collectively refer to such systems as disintegrated storage, and show integrated space lower bounds for asynchronous regular wait-free emulations in all of them. In a nutshell, if readers are invisible, then the storage cost of such systems is inherently exponential in the size of written values; otherwise, it is at least linear in the number of readers. Our bounds are asymptotically tight to known algorithms, and thus justify their high costs.",

    "abstract": "In the last three decades, we have seen a significant increase in trading goods and services through online auctions. However, this business created an attractive environment for malicious moneymakers who can commit different types of fraud activities, such as Shill Bidding (SB). The latter is predominant across many auctions but this type of fraud is difficult to detect due to its similarity to normal bidding behaviour. The unavailability of SB datasets makes the development of SB detection and classification models burdensome. Furthermore, to implement efficient SB detection models, we should produce SB data from actual auctions of commercial sites. In this study, we first scraped a large number of eBay auctions of a popular product. After preprocessing the raw auction data, we build a high-quality SB dataset based on the most reliable SB strategies. The aim of our research is to share the preprocessed auction dataset as well as the SB training (unlabelled) dataset, thereby researchers can apply various machine learning techniques by using authentic data of auctions and fraud.",

After being trained end-to-end on authentic records, the model can generate realistic chief complaint text that preserves much of the epidemiological information in the original data. As a side effect of the model's optimization goal, these synthetic chief complaints are also free of relatively uncommon abbreviation and misspellings, and they include none of the personally-identifiable information (PII) that was in the training data, suggesting it may be used to support the de-identification of text in EHRs. When combined with algorithms like generative adversarial networks (GANs), our model could be used to generate fully-synthetic EHRs, facilitating data sharing between healthcare providers and researchers and improving our ability to develop machine learning methods tailored to the information in healthcare data.",

The new formulations will be beneficial in robotic and dynamic surveillance environments when the camera needs to be calibrated while it freely moves and zooms. By establishing a correspondence between only two images taken after slightly panning and tilting the camera and a reference image, our proposed Simplified Calibration Method is able to calculate the focal length of the camera. We extensively evaluate the derived formulations on a simulated camera, 3D scenes and real-world images. Our error analysis over simulated and real images indicates that the proposed Simplified Active Calibration formulation estimates the parameters of a camera with low error rates.",

Based essentially on the security of electronic signatures, the Ecash introduced here will put the users back to the center of the game and exclude miners and their enormous waste of power energy. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to show that even a piece of paper can be recycled into a secure Ecash, while remaining environmentally friendly. Hence, we create here a cryptocurrency that would use a slight modification of the current banknotes to set up anonymous electronic transactions. By trading with banknotes, we mechanically transfer ownership of the paper money from one owner to another, hence, in this scheme, we introduce the notion of ownership transfer. It implies that at each transaction the elements allowing to authenticate the Ecash does not change, while the ownership certificate will change since the Ecash is transfer towards someone else.",

To address this fundamental shortcoming, we introduce Charlotte, a system for maintaining decentralized, authenticated data structures, including transaction logs. Each data structurestructure -- indeed, each block -- specifies its own availability and integrity properties, allowing Charlotte applications to retain the full benefits of permissioned or permissionless blockchains. In Charlotte, a block can be atomically appended to multiple logs, allowing applications to be interoperable when they want to, without inefficiently forcing all applications to share one big log. We call this open graph of interconnected blocks a blockweb. We allow new kinds of blockweb applications that operate beyond traditional chains. We demonstrate the viability of Charlotte applications with proof-of-concept servers running interoperable blockchains. Using performance data from our prototype, we estimate that when compared with traditional blockchains, Charlotte offers multiple orders of magnitude improvement in speed and energy efficiency.",

To address this, we protect the core security assets of network elements - authentication credentials and cryptographic context - by provisioning them to and maintaining them exclusively in isolated execution environments. We complement this with a secure and scalable mechanism to enroll network elements into software defined networks.

Users also have difficulty discovering and tracking onion sites and authenticating them. Finally, users want technical improvements to onion services and better information on how to use them. Our findings suggest various improvements for the security and usability of Tor onion services, including ways to automatically detect phishing of onion services, more clear security indicators, and ways to manage onion domain names that are difficult to remember.",

However, location provenance is subject to tampering and collusion attacks by malicious users. In this paper, we examine the secure location provenance problem. We introduce a witness-endorsed scheme for generating collusion-resistant location proofs. We also describe two efficient and privacy-preserving schemes for protecting the integrity of the chronological order of location proofs. These schemes, based on hash chains and Bloom filters respectively, allow users to prove the order of any arbitrary subsequence of their location history to auditors. Finally, we present experimental results from our proof-of-concept implementation on the Android platform and show that our schemes are practical in today's mobile devices.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, online education has been considered as one of the most widely used IT services. Researchers in this field face many challenges in the realm of Electronic learning services. Nowadays, many researchers in the field of learning and eLearning study curriculum planning, considering its complexity and the various numbers of effective parameters. The success of a curriculum is a multifaceted issue which needs analytical modelling for precise simulations of the different learning scenarios. In this paper, parameters involved in the learning process will be identified and a curriculum will be propounded. Furthermore, a Curriculum model will be proposed using the behavior of the user, based on the logs of the server. This model will estimate the success rate of the users while taking courses. Authentic Bayesian networks have been used for modelling. In order to evaluate the proposed model, the data of three consecutive semesters of 117 MS IT Students of E-Learning Center of Amirkabir University of Technology has been used. The assessment clarifies the effects of various parameters on the success of curriculum planning.",

The current method of monitoring students movement is inefficient and brings difficulty to the University Halls management checking students exit or entry into the halls of residence as well as impersonation. By using nexus combination of Ubiquitous Mobile Computing Technology through Mobile Short Message Service and biometric fingerprint approach exeat management and monitoring is quick and easy. Result after testing of the designed and simulated system shows that exeat monitoring systems is less prone to forgery as stakeholders are carried along, capable of preventing impersonation among students, and provide absolute electronic compliance to the policy of issuing exeat to students in the University Halls of Residence.",

However, publishers who use CDNs today must trust their CDN not to modify the site's JavaScript, CSS, images or other media en route to end users. A CDN that violates this trust could inject ads into websites, downsample media to save bandwidth or, worse, inject malicious JavaScript code to steal user secrets it could not otherwise access.

    "abstract": "We present SAFE, an integrated system for managing trust using a logic-based declarative language. Logical trust systems authorize each request by constructing a proof from a context---a set of authenticated logic statements representing credentials and policies issued by various principals in a networked system. A key barrier to practical use of logical trust systems is the problem of managing proof contexts: identifying, validating, and assembling the credentials and policies that are relevant to each trust decision. This paper describes a new approach to managing proof contexts using context linking and caching. Credentials and policies are stored as certified logic sets named by secure identifiers in a shared key-value store. SAFE offers language constructs to build and modify logic sets, link sets to form unions, pass them by reference, and add them to proof contexts. SAFE fetches and validates credential sets on demand and caches them in the authorizer. We evaluate and discuss our experience using SAFE to build secure services based on case studies drawn from practice: a secure name service resolver, a secure proxy shim for a key value store, and an authorization module for a networked infrastructure-as-a-service system with a federated trust structure.",

It has been reported that Pollock's paintings are fractal and it increased on his latest works. However our results show that fractal dimension of the paintings are on a range of fractal dimension with values close to two. We identify this behavior as a fractal-order transition. Based on the study of disorder-order transition in physical systems, we interpreted the fractal-order transition through its dark paint strokes in Pollocks' paintings, as structured lines following a power law measured by fractal dimension. We obtain self-similarity in some specific Pollock's paintings, that reveal an important dependence on the scale of observation. We also characterize by its fractal spectrum, the called \\emph{Teri's Find}. We obtained similar spectrums between \\emph{Teri's Find} and \\emph{Number 5} from Pollock, suggesting that fractal dimension cannot be completely rejected as a quantitative parameter to authenticate this kind of artworks.",

Eye movements contain abundant information about cognitive brain functions, neural pathways, etc. In the proposed method, eye movement data is classified into fixations and saccades. Features extracted from fixations and saccades are used by a Gaussian Radial Basis Function Network (GRBFN) based method for biometric authentication. A score fusion approach is adopted to classify the data in the output layer. In the evaluation stage, the algorithm has been tested using two types of stimuli: random dot following on a screen and text reading. The results indicate the strength of eye movement pattern as a biometric modality. The algorithm has been evaluated on BioEye 2015 database and found to outperform all the other methods. Eye movements are generated by a complex oculomotor plant which is very hard to spoof by mechanical replicas. Use of eye movement dynamics along with iris recognition technology may lead to a robust counterfeit-resistant person identification system.",

Granular evaluation of provenance of physical goods--e.g. tracking ingredients of a pharmaceutical or demonstrating authenticity of luxury goods--has often not been possible with today's items that are produced and transported in complex, inter-organizational, often internationally-spanning supply chains. Recent adoption of Internet of Things and Blockchain technologies give promise at better supply chain provenance. We are particularly interested in the blockchain as many favoured use cases of blockchain are for provenance tracking. We are also interested in applying ontologies as there has been some work done on knowledge provenance, traceability, and food provenance using ontologies. In this paper, we make a case for why ontologies can contribute to blockchain design. To support this case, we analyze a traceability ontology and translate some of its representations to smart contracts that execute a provenance trace and enforce traceability constraints on the Ethereum blockchain platform.",

A secure communication has a different meaning depending on the underlying application. It ranges from the confidentiality of a data to e.g. verifiability in electronic voting systems. Another example of a security notion is privacy. Formal symbolic models have proved their usefulness for analysing the security of protocols. Until quite recently, most results focused on trace properties like confidentiality or authentication. There are however several security properties, which cannot be defined (or cannot be naturally defined) as trace properties and require a notion of behavioural equivalence. Typical examples are anonymity, and privacy related properties. During the last decade, several results and verification tools have been developed to analyse equivalence-based security properties. We propose here a synthesis of decidability and undecidability results for equivalence-based security properties. Moreover, we give an overview of existing verification tools that may be used to verify equivalence-based security properties.",

    "abstract": "Many natural and manmade dynamical systems that are modeled as large nonlinear multi-oscillator systems like power systems are hard to analyze. For such a system, we propose a nonlinear modal decoupling (NMD) approach inversely constructing as many decoupled nonlinear oscillators as the system oscillation modes so that individual decoupled oscillators can easily be analyzed to infer dynamics and stability of the original system. The NMD follows a similar idea to the normal form except that we eliminate inter-modal terms but allow intra-modal terms of desired nonlinearities in decoupled systems, so decoupled systems can flexibly be shaped into desired forms of nonlinear oscillators. The NMD is then applied to power systems towards two types of nonlinear oscillators, i.e. the single-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) systems and a proposed non-SMIB oscillator. Numerical studies on a 3-machine 9-bus system and New England 10-machine 39-bus system show that (i) decoupled oscillators keep a majority of the original system modal nonlinearities and the NMD provides a bigger validity region than the normal form, and (ii) decoupled non-SMIB oscillators may keep more authentic dynamics of the original system than decoupled SMIB systems.",

The exact time and date, together with the unique identifier of the scanned card are stored locally on a storage media, before the data is relayed via the XBee to the remote database. The captured data is then authenticated by comparing with the pre-entered data to give access or authorization to the corporate resources, as well as recorded for attendance purposes.

The matcher considers all possible minutia pairings and iteratively aligns the two sets until the number of minutia pairs does not exceed the maximum number of allowable one-to-one pairings. The optimal alignment parameters are derived analytically via linear least squares. The first alignment establishes a region of overlap between the two minutia sets, which is then (iteratively) refined by each successive alignment. After each alignment, minutia pairs that exhibit weak correspondence are discarded. The process is repeated until the number of remaining pairs no longer exceeds the maximum number of allowable one-to-one pairings. The proposed algorithm is tested on both the FVC2000 and FVC2002 databases, and the results indicate that the proposed matcher is both effective and efficient for fingerprint authentication; it is fast and does not utilize any computationally expensive mathematical functions (e.g. trigonometric, exponential). In addition to the proposed matcher, another contribution of the paper is the analytical derivation of the least squares solution for the optimal alignment parameters for two point-sets lacking exact correspondence.",

It does not depend on external hardware or a network connection and can be readily implemented on many receivers via a firmware update. Crucially, the detector can with high probability distinguish low-power spoofing from ordinary multipath.

Watermark is created based on 32-bit PKCS serial number and embedded into the captured image. Watermark detection on the receiver side extracts the serial number and indicates the camera which captured the image by comparing the original and the extracted serial numbers. The watermarking procedure is designed to provide robustness to image optimization based on the Compressive Sensing approach. Also, the procedure is tested under various attacks and shows successful identification of ownership.",

If they follow recommended practice, users are faced with the almost insuperable problem of generating and managing a large number of site-unique and strong (i.e. non-guessable) passwords. One way of addressing this problem is through the use of a password generator, i.e. a client-side scheme which generates (and regenerates) site-specific strong passwords on demand, with the minimum of user input. This paper provides a detailed specification and analysis of AutoPass, a password generator scheme previously outlined as part of a general analysis of such schemes. AutoPass has been designed to address issues identified in previously proposed password generators, and incorporates novel techniques to address these issues. Unlike almost all previously proposed schemes, AutoPass enables the generation of passwords that meet important real-world requirements, including forced password changes, use of pre-specified passwords, and generation of passwords meeting site-specific requirements.",

In second, this signature is extracted in an encrypted form and gives no clues about the image content. In a third time, its calculation does not require the cloud to communicate with a trusted third party as usually proposed by other existing schemes. More clearly, all computations required in order to look for similar images are conducted by the cloud only with no extra-communications. To make possible such a computation, we propose a new fast way to compare encrypted data, these ones being encrypted by the same public key or not, and using a recursive relationship in-between Paillier random values when computing the different resolution levels of the image wavelet transform. Experiments conducted in two distinct frameworks: medical image retrieval with as purpose diagnosis aid support, and face recognition for user authentication; indicate that the proposed SOCBIR does not change image retrieval performance.",

Vamos can be integrated into any mobile video capture application without requiring special user training. We develop novel attacks that target liveness verification solutions. The attacks leverage both fully automated algorithms and trained human experts. We introduce the concept of video motion categories to annotate the camera and user motion characteristics of arbitrary videos. We show that the performance of Vamos depends on the video motion category. Even though Vamos uses motion as a basis for verification, we observe a surprising and seemingly counter-intuitive resilience against attacks performed on relatively \"stationary\" video chunks, which turn out to contain hard-to-imitate involuntary movements. We show that overall the accuracy of Vamos on the task of verifying whole length videos exceeds 93\\% against the new attacks.",

Drawing on a large number of recipes from Yummly, an example shows how the proposed system can transform a traditional Japanese recipe, Sukiyaki, into French style.",

We proposed zero-contention cache memory or policy between REE and TEE to prevent from TruSpy attacks in TrustZone. And we suggested that delay time of data path of REE is equal or similar to that of data path of TEE to prevent timing side-channel attacks. Also, we proposed security information flow control based on the Clark-Wilson model, and built the information flow control mechanism using Authentication Tokenization Program (ATP). Accordingly we can expect the improved integrity of the information content between REE and TEE on mobile devices.",

While promising for a wide range of applications, current blockchain platforms rely on digital signatures, which are vulnerable to attacks by means of quantum computers. The same, albeit to a lesser extent, applies to cryptographic hash functions that are used in preparing new blocks, so parties with access to quantum computation would have unfair advantage in procuring mining rewards.

We conduct experiments to verify the computational and communication efficiency for using these signatures in the standard time synchronization protocols NTP and PTP. We propose additional security measures to prevent replay attacks and to mitigate delay attacks. Our proposed solutions cover 1-step mode for NTP and PTP and we extend our security measures specifically to 2-step mode (PTP) and show that they have no impact on time synchronization's precision.",

    "abstract": "Designing an efficient protocol for avoiding the threat of recording based attack in presence of a powerful eavesdropper remains a challenge for more than two decades. During authentication, the absence of any secure link between the prover and verifier makes things even more vulnerable as, after observing a threshold challenge-response pair, users' secret may easily get derived due to information leakage. Existing literature only present new methodologies with ensuring superior aspects over previous ones, while ignoring the aspects on which their proposed schemes cope poorly. Unsurprisingly, most of them are far from satisfactory - either are found far from usable or lack of security features. To overcome this issue, we first introduce the concept of \"leakage control\" which puts a bar on the natural information leakage rate and greatly helps in increasing both the usability and security standards. Not just prevention, but also, by introducing the threat detection strategy (based on the concept of honeyword), our scheme \"lights two candles\". It not only eliminates the long terms security and usability conflict under the practical scenario, but along with threat detection from the client side, it is capable of protecting the secret at the server side under the distributed framework, and thus, guaranteeing security beyond the conventional limit.",

These decision levels are often independent and distributed, and sensitive pieces of information making up the military mission must be kept hidden from one level to another even if all of the decision levels cooperate to accomplish the same task. Usually, a mission is negotiated through insecure networks such as the Internet using cryptographic protocols. In such protocols, few security properties have to be ensured. However, designing a secure cryptographic protocol that ensures several properties at once is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new secure protocol for multipart military missions that involve two independent and distributed decision levels having different security levels. We show that it ensures the secrecy, authentication, and non-repudiation properties. In addition, we show that it resists against man-in-the-middle attacks.",

We present a simple logic based on the well-understood modal operators of knowledge, time, and probability, and show that it is able to handle issues that have often been swept under the rug by other approaches, while being flexible enough to capture all the higher- level security notions that appear in BAN logic. Moreover, while still assuming that the knowledge operator allows for unbounded computation, it can handle the fact that a computationally bounded agent cannot decrypt messages in a natural way, by distinguishing strings and message terms. We demonstrate that our logic can capture BAN logic notions by providing a translation of the BAN operators into our logic, capturing belief by a form of probabilistic knowledge.",

This network works on raw input iris images without any pre-processing and segmentation requirement and this is one of its prodigious strength. We have performed extensive experimentation on two publicly available data-sets namely: 1)IIIT-D 2)ND and on IIT-K data-set (not publicly available) to ensure the generalizability of our network.

Next in the context of signal-spaces as a categories we study the various covariant and contravariant forms of $L^0$ and $L^2$ functors using categories of measurable or measure spaces and their opposites involving Boolean and measure algebras along with partial extension. Finally we contribute a novel definition of intra-signal redundancy using general concept of isomorphism arrow in a category covering the translation case and others as special cases. Through category-theory we provide a simple yet precise explanation for the well-known heuristic of lossless differential encoding standards yielding better compressions in image types such as line drawings, iconic image, text etc; as compared to classic representation techniques such as JPEG which choose bases or frames in a global Hilbert space.",

    "abstract": "In the past several decades, many authorship attribution studies have used computational methods to determine the authors of disputed texts. Disputed authorship is a common problem in Classics, since little information about ancient documents has survived the centuries. Many scholars have questioned the authenticity of the final chapter of Xenophon's Cyropaedia, a 4th century B.C. historical text. In this study, we use N-grams frequency vectors with a cosine similarity function and word frequency vectors with Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBC) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to analyze the authorship of the Cyropaedia. Although the N-gram analysis shows that the epilogue of the Cyropaedia differs slightly from the rest of the work, comparing the analysis of Xenophon with analyses of Aristotle and Plato suggests that this difference is not significant. Both NBC and SVM analyses of word frequencies show that the final chapter of the Cyropaedia is closely related to the other chapters of the Cyropaedia. Therefore, this analysis suggests that the disputed chapter was written by Xenophon. This information can help scholars better understand the Cyropaedia and also demonstrates the usefulness of applying modern authorship analysis techniques to classical literature.",

Wireless systems are considered to provide numerous advantages over wired systems in industrial applications for example.

These range from passive eavesdropping attacks to active attacks like data manipulation or masquerade attacks. Therefore it is necessary to provide reliable and efficient security mechanisms. One of the most important security issue in such a system is to ensure integrity as well as authenticity of exchanged messages over the air between communicating devices in order to prohibit active attacks. In the present work, an approach on how to achieve this goal in MC-MTC systems based on Physical Layer Security (PHYSEC), especially a new method based on keeping track of channel variations, will be presented and a proof-of-concept evaluation is given.",

Different from traditional communications, in the CodeHop scheme, the legitimate receiver (Bob) rapidly switches the parity-check matrix upon each correctly received source message block. Given an authenticated public feedback channel, the transmitter's (Alice) parity-check matrix can also be synchronized with the receiver's. As a result, once an eavesdropper (Eve) erroneously decodes a message block, she may not be able to follow the update of subsequent parity-check matrices. Thus, the average BER of Eve will be very close to $0.5$ if the transmitted number of message blocks is large enough. Focused on the measure of security gap defined as the difference of channel quality between Bob and Eve, numerical results show that the CodeHop scheme outperforms other solutions by sufficiently reducing the security gap without sacrificing the error-correcting performance of Bob.",

Parties each have a PUF used for encryption and decryption; this is facilitated by constraining the PUF to be commutative. This framework is evaluated with a primitive permutation network - a barrel shifter. Physical randomness is derived from the delay of different shift paths. Barrel shifter (BS) PUF captures the delay of different shift paths. This delay is entangled with message bits before they are sent across an insecure channel. BS-PUF is implemented using transmission gates; their characteristics ensure same-chip reproducibility, a necessary property of PUFs. Post-layout simulations of a common centroid layout 8-level barrel shifter in 0.13 {\\mu}m technology assess uniqueness, stability and randomness properties. BS-PUFs pass all selected NIST statistical randomness tests. Stability similar to Ring Oscillator (RO) PUFs under environment variation is shown. Logistic regression of 100,000 plaintext-ciphertext pairs (PCPs) failed to successfully model BS- PUF behavior.",

    "abstract": "Any on-demand pseudonym acquisition strategy is problematic should the connectivity to the credential management infrastructure be intermittent. If a vehicle runs out of pseudonyms with no connectivity to refill its pseudonym pool, one solution is the on-the-fly generation of pseudonyms, e.g., leveraging anonymous authentication. However, such a vehicle would stand out in the crowd: one can simply distinguish pseudonyms, thus signed messages, based on the pseudonym issuer signature, link them and track the vehicle. To address this challenge, we propose a randomized hybrid scheme, RHyTHM, to enable vehicles to remain operational when disconnected without compromising privacy: vehicles with valid pseudonyms help others to enhance their privacy by randomly joining them in using on-the-fly self-certified pseudonyms along with aligned lifetimes. This way, the privacy of disconnected users is enhanced with a reasonable computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "The primary purpose of a fingerprint recognition system is to ensure a reliable and accurate user authentication, but the security of the recognition system itself can be jeopardized by spoof attacks. This study addresses the problem of developing accurate, generalizable, and efficient algorithms for detecting fingerprint spoof attacks. Specifically, we propose a deep convolutional neural network based approach utilizing local patches centered and aligned using fingerprint minutiae. Experimental results on three public-domain LivDet datasets (2011, 2013, and 2015) show that the proposed approach provides state-of-the-art accuracies in fingerprint spoof detection for intra-sensor, cross-material, cross-sensor, as well as cross-dataset testing scenarios. For example, in LivDet 2015, the proposed approach achieves 99.03% average accuracy over all sensors compared to 95.51% achieved by the LivDet 2015 competition winners. Additionally, two new fingerprint presentation attack datasets containing more than 20,000 images, using two different fingerprint readers, and over 12 different spoof fabrication materials are collected. We also present a graphical user interface, called Fingerprint Spoof Buster, that allows the operator to visually examine the local regions of the fingerprint highlighted as live or spoof, instead of relying on only a single score as output by the traditional approaches.",

We show that classification performance can be significantly improved by replacing the PD detector's symmetric-difference-based distortion measurement with one based on the post-fit residuals of the maximum-likelihood estimate of a single-signal correlation function model. We call the improved technique the PD-ML detector. In direct comparison with the PD detector, the PD-ML detector exhibits improved classification accuracy when tested against an extensive library of recorded field data. In particular, it is (1) significantly more accurate at distinguishing a spoofing attack from a jamming attack, (2) better at distinguishing multipath-afflicted data from interference-free data, and (3) less likely to issue a false alarm by classifying multipath as spoofing. The PD-ML detector achieves this improved performance at the expense of additional computational complexity.",

This research study involved a comprehensive survey of supportive technology tools, as well as secondary survey research from students and teachers with actual experience in PBL. The goal was to determine which types of technology tools were most supportive of PBL. Overall, the study found that teachers and students are mostly aligned with regards to the importance of technology and the effectiveness of various types of tools. Tools which fostered collaboration amongst teacher and students were ultimately deemed the most effective, but content-development and assessment tools were also found to be particularly helpful.",

    "abstract": "Recently image inpainting has witnessed rapid progress due to generative adversarial networks (GAN) that are able to synthesize realistic contents. However, most existing GAN-based methods for semantic inpainting apply an auto-encoder architecture with a fully connected layer, which cannot accurately maintain spatial information. In addition, the discriminator in existing GANs struggle to understand high-level semantics within the image context and yield semantically consistent content. Existing evaluation criteria are biased towards blurry results and cannot well characterize edge preservation and visual authenticity in the inpainting results. In this paper, we propose an improved generative adversarial network to overcome the aforementioned limitations. Our proposed GAN-based framework consists of a fully convolutional design for the generator which helps to better preserve spatial structures and a joint loss function with a revised perceptual loss to capture high-level semantics in the context. Furthermore, we also introduce two novel measures to better assess the quality of image inpainting results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the art under a wide range of criteria.",

Certificateless public key cryptography was first introduced by Al-Riyami and Paterson in Asiacrypt 2003. In certificateless cryptography, it does not require the use of certificates to guarantee the authenticity of users' public keys. Meanwhile, certificateless cryptography does not have the key escrow problem, which seems to be inherent in the Identity-based cryptography. In this paper, we propose a concrete certificateless ring signature scheme. The security models of certificateless ring signature are also formalized. Our new scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model, with the assumption that the Computational Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. In addition, we also show that a generic construction of certificateless ring signature is insecure against the key replacement attack defined in our security models.",

The consequences of stolen credentials go well beyond the leakage of other types of information because they can further compromise other systems. This paper criticizes the practice of using clear-text identity attributes, such as Social Security or driver's license numbers -- which are in principle not even secret -- as acceptable authentication tokens or assertions of ownership, and proposes a simple protocol that straightforwardly applies public-key cryptography to make identity claims verifiable, even when they are issued remotely via the Internet. This protocol has the potential of elevating the business practices of credit providers, rental agencies, and other service companies that have hitherto exposed consumers to the risk of identity theft, to where identity theft becomes virtually impossible.",

This negative effect brings inconvenience to users in authentication applications. However, in the negative recognition scenario where users may intentionally distort their fingerprints, this can be a serious problem since distortion will prevent recognition system from identifying malicious users. Current methods aimed at addressing this problem still have limitations. They are often not accurate because they estimate distortion parameters based on the ridge frequency map and orientation map of input samples, which are not reliable due to distortion. Secondly, they are not efficient and requiring significant computation time to rectify samples. In this paper, we develop a rectification model based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to accurately estimate distortion parameters from the input image. Using a comprehensive database of synthetic distorted samples, the DCNN learns to accurately estimate distortion bases ten times faster than the dictionary search methods used in the previous approaches. Evaluating the proposed method on public databases of distorted samples shows that it can significantly improve the matching performance of distorted samples.",

In this work, we propose an image processing pipeline that operates on hyperspectral images to separate such layers. Using this pipeline, we show that hyperspectral images enable better layer separation than RGB images, and that spectral focus stacking aids the layer separation.

Consecutively, the fully-connected layer transfers the extracted feature maps of stylized images into the corresponding feature maps of real faces and the deconvolutional layers generate real faces from the transferred feature maps. To enforce the destylized faces to be similar to authentic face images, we employ a discriminative network, which consists of convolutional and fully connected layers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our network by conducting experiments on an extensive set of synthetic images.

Unfortunately, many such generated input images often render inferior authenticity, lacking accurate semantic information of the driving scenes and hence compromising the resulting efficacy and reliability. In this paper, we propose DeepRoad, an unsupervised framework to automatically generate large amounts of accurate driving scenes to test the consistency of DNN-based autonomous driving systems across different scenes. In particular, DeepRoad delivers driving scenes with various weather conditions (including those with rather extreme conditions) by applying the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) along with the corresponding real-world weather scenes.

First, we introduce a new spectral function that captures different information from the minutia orientations. It is complementary to the original spectral function, and we use both of them to extract information from a fingerprint image.

Unlike in existing works, we highlight the major role of the smoothness properties of the spectral abscissa function. Even if the matrices of the eigenvalue problem are analytic functions of the parameters, the spectral abscissa function may not be everywhere differentiable, even not everywhere Lipschitz continuous, which is related to multiple rightmost eigenvalues or rightmost eigenvalues with multiplicity higher than one. The presented analysis demonstrates that the smoothness properties heavily affect the approximation errors of the Galerkin and collocation-based polynomial approximations, and the numerical errors of the evaluation of coefficients with integration methods. A documentation of the experiments, conducted on the benchmark problems through the software Chebfun, is publicly available.",

Results indicate that the correlation in gait-based features across different body locations is sufficient to establish secure device pairing. However, the population size of the studies is limited and powerful attackers with e.g. capability of video recording are not considered. We present a concise discussion of security properties of gait-based pairing schemes including a discussion of popular quantization schemes, classification and analysis of attack surfaces, discussion of statistical properties of generated sequences, an entropy analysis, as well as possible threats and security weaknesses of gait-based pairing systems. For one of the schemes considered, we present modifications to fix an identified security flaw. As a general limitation of gait-based authentication or pairing systems, we further demonstrate that an adversary with video support can create key sequences that are sufficiently close to on-body generated acceleration sequences to breach gait-based security mechanisms.",

The proposed method is implemented using a convolutional neural network (CNN) comprising two autoencoders and a transformer and is trained using a black-box discriminator without gradient information. Over 50% of the transformed CG images were not detected by three state-of-the-art spoofing detectors. This capability raises an alarm regarding the reliability of facial authentication systems, which are becoming widely used in daily life.",

Providing cellular connectivity to UAVs will enable a myriad of applications ranging from online video streaming to medical delivery. However, to enable a reliable wireless connectivity for the UAVs as well as a secure operation, various challenges need to be addressed such as interference management, mobility management and handover, cyber-physical attacks, and authentication. In this paper, the goal is to expose the wireless and security challenges that arise in the context of UAV-based delivery systems, UAV-based real-time multimedia streaming, and UAV-enabled intelligent transportation systems. To address such challenges, artificial neural network (ANN) based solution schemes are introduced. The introduced approaches enable the UAVs to adaptively exploit the wireless system resources while guaranteeing a secure operation, in real-time. Preliminary simulation results show the benefits of the introduced solutions for each of the aforementioned cellular-connected UAV application use case.",

In this work we present a simple yet effective liveness detection approach to enhance 2D face recognition methods and make them robust against spoofing attacks. We show that the risk to spoofing attacks can be re- duced through the use of an additional source of light, for example a flash. From a pair of input images taken under different illumination, we define discriminative features that implicitly contain facial three-dimensional in- formation. Furthermore, we show that when multiple sources of light are considered, we are able to validate which one has been activated. This makes possible the design of a highly secure active-light authentication framework. Finally, further investigating the use of 3D features without 3D reconstruction, we introduce an approximated disparity-based implicit 3D feature obtained from an uncalibrated stereo-pair of cameras. Valida- tion experiments show that the proposed methods produce state-of-the-art results in challenging scenarios with nearly no feature extraction latency.",

In particular, Match in Box is a first of a kind, portable, low-cost, and easy-to-assemble fingerprint reader with an enrollment database embedded within the reader's memory and open source fingerprint spoof detector, feature extractor, and matcher all running on the reader's internal vision processing unit (VPU). An onboard touch screen and rechargeable battery pack make this device extremely portable and ideal for applying both fingerprint authentication (1:1 comparison) and fingerprint identification (1:N search) to applications (vaccination tracking, food and benefit distribution programs, human trafficking prevention) in rural communities, especially in developing countries. We also show that Match in Box is suited for capturing neonate fingerprints due to its high resolution (1900 ppi) cameras.",

We compare the measures and suggest to use their linear combination in a kernel. We test the resulting model in an optimization framework, using symbolic regression problem instances as a benchmark. Our experiments show that the model provides valuable information. Firstly, the model enables an improved optimization performance compared to a model-free algorithm. Furthermore, the model provides information on the contribution of different distance measures. The data indicates that a phenotypic distance measure is important during the early stages of an optimization run when less data is available. In contrast, genotypic measures, such as the tree edit distance, contribute more during the later stages.",

In this extended abstract, we leverage the state-of-the-art VPKI system and enhance its functionality towards a highly-available and dynamically-scalable design, this ensures that the system remains operational in the presence of benign failures or any resource depletion attack, and that it dynamically scales out, or possibly scales in, according to the requests' arrival rate.

The certificate and revocation transparency is implemented efficiently using two blockchains. We design a trust model to improve the trustworthiness of messages relying on the reputation of the sender based on both direct historical interactions and indirect opinions about the sender.

    "abstract": "In many Industry Internet of Things (IIoT) applications, resources like CPU, memory, and battery power are limited and cannot afford the classic cryptographic security solutions. Silicon Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is a lightweight security primitive that exploits manufacturing variations during the chip fabrication process for key generation and/or device authentication. However, traditional weak PUFs such as Ring Oscillator (RO) PUF generate chip-unique key for each device, which restricts their application in security protocols where the same key is required to be shared in resource-constrained devices. In order to address this issue, we propose a PUF-based key sharing method for the first time. The basic idea is to implement one-to-one input-output mapping with Lookup Table (LUT)-based interstage crossing structures in each level of inverters of RO PUF. Individual customization on configuration bits of interstage crossing structure and different RO selections with challenges bring high flexibility. Therefore, with the flexible configuration of interstage crossing structures and challenges, CRO PUF can generate the same shared key for resource-constrained devices, which enables a new application for lightweight key sharing protocols.",

Combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), GIN discovers the pathophysiologic meaning of the feature space. Moreover, a test of predicting the surgical outcome directly using the selected features results in a high accuracy of 81.55%, which suggests little pathophysiologic information has been lost while conducting the feature selection. This demonstrates GIN can generate virtual patients not only visually authentic but also pathophysiologically interpretable.",

In order to support \"real-time enterprise\" for software organizations and provide information transparency for diverse stakeholders, we integrate heterogeneous data sources about software analytics, such as static code analysis, testing results, issue tracking systems, network monitoring systems, etc. To deal with the heterogeneity of the underlying data sources, we follow an ontology-based data integration approach in this paper and define an ontology that captures the semantics of relevant data for software analytics. Furthermore, we focus on the integration of such data sources by proposing two approaches: a static and a dynamic one. We first discuss the current static approach with a predefined set of analytic views representing software quality factors and further envision how this process could be automated in order to dynamically build custom user analysis using a semi-automatic platform for managing the lifecycle of analytics infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "The increasingly pervasive connectivity of today's information systems brings up new challenges to security. Traditional security has accomplished a long way toward protecting well-defined goals such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity. However, with the growing sophistication of the attacks and the complexity of the system, the protection using traditional methods could be cost-prohibitive. A new perspective and a new theoretical foundation are needed to understand security from a strategic and decision-making perspective. Game theory provides a natural framework to capture the adversarial and defensive interactions between an attacker and a defender. It provides a quantitative assessment of security, prediction of security outcomes, and a mechanism design tool that can enable security-by-design and reverse the attacker's advantage. This tutorial provides an overview of diverse methodologies from game theory that includes games of incomplete information, dynamic games, mechanism design theory to offer a modern theoretic underpinning of a science of cybersecurity. The tutorial will also discuss open problems and research challenges that the CCS community can address and contribute with an objective to build a multidisciplinary bridge between cybersecurity, economics, game and decision theory.",

However, some threats remain that, to provide reliable security, require human intervention: e.g., through users paying attention to warning messages or completing secondary authentication procedures. While prior work has broadly explored people's mental models of digital security threats, we know little about users' precise, in-the-moment response process to in-the-wild threats. In this work, we conduct a series of qualitative interviews (n=67) with users who had recently experienced suspicious login incidents on their real Facebook accounts in order to explore this process of account security incident response. We find a common process across participants from five countries -- with differing online and offline cultures -- allowing us to identify areas for future technical development to best support user security. We provide additional insights on the unique nature of incident-response information seeking, known attacker threat models, and lessons learned from a large, cross-cultural qualitative study of digital security.",

A company (data owner) who lacks expertise and comptational resources can outsource his data to a third-party service provider (server), who provides storage and query evaluation on the outsourced data as the services. One of the security concerns of the outsourcing paradigm is the integrity of the returned query results on the outsourced data. In this paper, we consider the outsourcing of probabilistic databases, on which query evaluation is of high complexity. A dishonest server may return cheap (and incorrect) query answers, hoping that the client who has weak computational power cannot catch the incorrect results. To address this issue, we design efficient integrity verification methods for both all-answer and top-k query evaluation on outsourced probabilistic databases. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our verification methods.",

In this paper, we first identify and formalise several new but important privacy properties on enforcing doctor privacy. Then we analyse the security and privacy of a complicated and practical e-health protocol (DLV08). Our analysis uncovers ambiguities in the protocol, and shows to what extent these new privacy properties as well as other security properties (such as secrecy and authentication) and privacy properties (such as anonymity and untraceability) are satisfied by the protocol. Finally, we address the found ambiguities which result in both security and privacy flaws, and propose suggestions for fixing them.",

    "abstract": "In order to counter forgeries of tickets for public transport or mass events, a method to validate them, using printed unique random pattern markers was developed. These markers themselves are unforgeable by their physically random distribution. To assure their authenticity, however, they have to be cryptographically protected and equipped with an environment for successful validation, combining physical and cyber security protection. This paper describes an architecture for cryptographically protecting these markers, which are stored in Aztec codes on physical tickets, in order to assure that only an authorized printer can generate a valid Aztec code of such a pattern, thus providing forge protection in combination with the randomness and uniqueness of the pattern. Nevertheless, the choice of the signature algorithm is heavily constrained by the sizes of the pattern, ticket provider data, metadata and the signature confronted by the data volume the code hold. Therefore, this paper also defines an example for a signature layout for the proposed architecture. This allows for a lightweight ticket validation system that is both physically and cryptographically secured to form a smart solution for mass access verification for both shorter to longer periods at relatively low cost.",

Based on the above objectives, this paper proposes three lemmas and proves that they are indeed feasible. First, how does a recipient of a digitally signed document verify the authenticity of the signature? Second, when a digitally signed document is under dispute, how can the group's manager find out the identity of the original group member who signed the document, if necessary for an investigation? Third, how can we prove that the signature is indeed forged following an external attack from a supercomputer? Soon, in a future paper, we will extend this work to make the scheme even more effective. Following an attack, the signature could be proved to be forged without the need to expose the key.",

Such approach also makes it possible to create multi-dimensional \"crypt-code structures\" to conduct multi-level monitoring and veracious restoration of distorted encrypted information. The use of authentication codes as a means of one of the levels to detect erroneous blocks in the ciphertext in combination with the redundant residue polynomial codes of deductions makes it possible to decrease the introduced redundancy and find distorted blocks of the ciphertext to restore them.",

    "abstract": "In this contemporary world digital media such as videos and images behave as an active medium to carry valuable information across the globe on all fronts. However there are several techniques evolved to tamper the image which has made their authenticity untrustworthy. CopyMove Forgery CMF is one of the most common forgeries present in an image where a cluster of pixels are duplicated in the same image with potential postprocessing techniques. Various state-of-art techniques are developed in the recent years which are effective in detecting passive image forgery. However most methods do fail when the copied image is rescaled or added with certain intensity before being pasted due to de-synchronization of pixels in the searching process. To tackle this problem the paper proposes distinct novel algorithms which recognize a unique approach of using Hus invariant moments and Discreet Cosine Transformations DCT to attain the desired rescale invariant and intensity invariant CMF detection techniques respectively. The experiments conducted quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Most TLS clients such as modern web browsers enforce coarse-grained TLS security configurations. They support legacy versions of the protocol that have known design weaknesses, and weak ciphersuites that provide fewer security guarantees (e.g. non Forward-Secrecy), mainly to provide backward compatibility. This opens doors to downgrade attacks, as is the case of the POODLE attack [18], which exploits the client's silent fallback to downgrade the protocol version to exploit the legacy version's flaws. To achieve a better balance between security and backward compatibility, we propose a DNS-based mechanism that enables TLS servers to advertise their support for the latest version of the protocol and strong ciphersuites (that provide Forward-Secrecy and Authenticated-Encryption simultaneously). This enables clients to consider prior knowledge about the servers' TLS configurations to enforce a fine-grained TLS configurations policy. That is, the client enforces strict TLS configurations for connections going to the advertising servers, while enforcing default configurations for the rest of the connections. We implement and evaluate the proposed mechanism and show that it is feasible, and incurs minimal overhead. Furthermore, we conduct a TLS scan for the top 10,000 most visited websites globally, and show that most of the websites can benefit from our mechanism.",

SOS leverages the well-known \\muTESLA protocol, and includes some modifications necessary to deal with the severe bandwidth constraints of the ADS-B communication technology. In addition, SOS is resilient against message injection attacks, by recurring to majority voting techniques applied on central community servers. Overall, SOS emerges as a lightweight security solution, with a limited bandwidth overhead, that does not require any modification to the hardware already deployed. Further, SOS is standard compliant and able to reject active adversaries aiming at disrupting the correct functioning of the communication system.

Since hacking is typically a community effort? these days, security could be a community goal too. The challenges are manifold, and one reason for weak or absent security on IoT devices is their weak computational power.

Although effective, they can be resource-consuming and detection results may be sensitive to environmental changes. In this paper, we take iris movement as a significant liveness sign and propose a simple and efficient liveness detection system named IriTrack. Users are required to move their eyes along with a randomly generated poly-line, and trajectories of irises are then used as evidences for liveness detection. IriTrack allows checking liveness by using data collected during user-device interactions. We implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.

    "abstract": "The advent of deep perceptual networks brought about a paradigm shift in machine vision and image perception. Image apprehension lately carried out by hand-crafted features in the latent space have been replaced by deep features acquired from supervised networks for improved understanding. However, such deep networks require strict supervision with a substantial amount of the labeled data for authentic training process. These methods perform poorly in domains lacking labeled data especially in case of remote sensing image retrieval. Resolving this, we propose an unsupervised encoder-decoder feature for remote sensing image matching (RSIM). Moreover, we replace the conventional distance metrics with a deep discriminator network to identify the similarity of the image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, discriminator network has never been used before for solving RSIM problem. Results have been validated with two publicly available benchmark remote sensing image datasets. The technique has also been investigated for content-based remote sensing image retrieval (CBRSIR); one of the widely used applications of RSIM. Results demonstrate that our technique supersedes the state-of-the-art methods used for unsupervised image matching with mean average precision (mAP) of 81%, and image retrieval with an overall improvement in mAP score of about 12%.",

Using an authenticated data structure based on index-ordered Merkle trees (IOMTs), TCR aims to provide assurances of 1) Integrity, 2) Availability, and 3) Confidentiality to its users, whose containers are stored in an untrusted environment. Trust within the TCR architecture is rooted in a low-complexity, tamper-resistant trusted module. The use of IOMTs allows such a module to efficiently track a virtually unlimited number of container images, and thus provide the desired assurances for the system's users. Using a simulated version of the proposed system, we demonstrate the scalability of platform by showing logarithmic time complexity up to $2^{25}$ (32 million) container images. This paper presents both algorithmic and proof-of-concept software implementations of the proposed TCR infrastructure.",

In order to make it more difficult for a forger to attack the verification system, a promising strategy is to combine different writer models. In this work, we propose to complement a recent structural approach to offline signature verification based on graph edit distance with a statistical approach based on metric learning with deep neural networks. On the MCYT and GPDS benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that combining the structural and statistical models leads to significant improvements in performance, profiting from their complementary properties.",

Although we can obtain discriminative facial features through the state-of-the-art deep model training, how to decide the best threshold for practical use remains a challenge. We develop a technique of adaptive threshold mechanism to improve the recognition accuracy. We also design a face recognition system along with the registering procedure to handle online registration. Furthermore, we introduce a new evaluation protocol to better evaluate the performance of an algorithm for real-world scenarios. Under our proposed protocol, our method can achieve a 22\\% accuracy improvement on the LFW dataset.",

Most of the existing methods, such as the well-known Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), assume that the target matrix we wish to recover is low-rank. However, the underlying data structure is often non-linear in practice, therefore the low-rankness assumption could be violated. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel method for matrix recovery in this paper, which could well handle the case where the target matrix is low-rank in an implicit feature space but high-rank or even full-rank in its original form. Namely, our method pursues the low-rank structure of the target matrix in an implicit feature space. By making use of the specifics of an accelerated proximal gradient based optimization algorithm, the proposed method could recover the target matrix with non-linear structures from its corrupted version. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, a rapidly increasing number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems that adopt voice as the primary user input have emerged. These systems have been shown to be vulnerable to various types of voice spoofing attacks. Existing defense techniques can usually only protect from a specific type of attack or require an additional authentication step that involves another device. Such defense strategies are either not strong enough or lower the usability of the system. Based on the fact that legitimate voice commands should only come from humans rather than a playback device, we propose a novel defense strategy that is able to detect the sound source of a voice command based on its acoustic features. The proposed defense strategy does not require any information other than the voice command itself and can protect a system from multiple types of spoofing attacks. Our proof-of-concept experiments verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this defense strategy.",

The novelty is that when a designated verifier is unavailable, a central authority can authorise new verifiers to authenticate the user on behalf of the original verifier. Furthermore, if required, a central verifier is authorised to deanonymise users and trace their service requests. We formalise the scheme along with a security proof and provide an empirical evaluation of its performance. This scheme can be applied to smart ticketing where minimising the collection of personal information of users is increasingly important to transport organisations due to privacy regulations such as General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).",

Our experiments show that (1) GANs carry distinct model fingerprints and leave stable fingerprints in their generated images, which support image attribution; (2) even minor differences in GAN training can result in different fingerprints, which enables fine-grained model authentication; (3) fingerprints persist across different image frequencies and patches and are not biased by GAN artifacts; (4) fingerprint finetuning is effective in immunizing against five types of adversarial image perturbations; and (5) comparisons also show our learned fingerprints consistently outperform several baselines in a variety of setups.",

For that, in this paper, we propose a novel model which is called Ridge Polynomial Neural Network with Error-Output Feedbacks (RPNN-EOFs) that combines the properties of higher order and error-output feedbacks. The well-known Mackey-Glass time series is used to test the forecasting capability of RPNN-EOFS. Simulation results showed that the proposed RPNN-EOFs provides better understanding for the Mackey-Glass time series with root mean square error equal to 0.00416. This result is smaller than other models in the literature. Therefore, we can conclude that the RPNN-EOFs can be applied successfully for time series forecasting.",

It is likely that many users will need to rely on remote access to delegate their computation to the available hardware. In such a scenario, the privacy and reliability of the delegated computations are important concerns. On the other hand, the distributed nature of modern computations has led to a widespread class of applications in which a group of parties attempt to perform a joint task over their inputs, e.g., in cloud computing. In this paper, we study the multi-client delegated quantum computation problem where we consider the global computation be made up of local computations that are individually decided by the clients. Each client part is kept secret from the server and the other clients. We construct a composable secure multi-client delegated quantum computation scheme from any composable secure single-client delegated quantum computation protocol and quantum authentication codes.",

Therefore, researchers have recently designed various types of MLG authoring tools. However, these authoring tools are not always adapted to non-computer-scientists or non-game-designers. Hence, we propose in this paper to focus on five existing MLG authoring tools, in order to assess their features and usability with the help of five teachers, who are used to organizing educational field trips. In the second part of this paper, we present an approach for designing a MLG authoring tool, based on the lacks identified through the analysis, and tailored to the teachers' different profiles and needs.",

There is an increasing demand for querying the data stored in a blockchain database. To ensure query integrity, the user can maintain the entire blockchain database and query the data locally. However, this approach is not economic, if not infeasible, because of the blockchain's huge data size and considerable maintenance costs. In this paper, we take the first step toward investigating the problem of verifiable query processing over blockchain databases. We propose a novel framework, called vChain, that alleviates the storage and computing costs of the user and employs verifiable queries to guarantee the results' integrity. To support verifiable Boolean range queries, we propose an accumulator-based authenticated data structure that enables dynamic aggregation over arbitrary query attributes. Two new indexes are further developed to aggregate intra-block and inter-block data records for efficient query verification. We also propose an inverted prefix tree structure to accelerate the processing of a large number of subscription queries simultaneously.

The classifier is trained by using a new adaptive learning method. The training data are initially collected from social networks. The accuracy of the classifier is incrementally improved as the user starts using the system. A novel method has been introduced to improve the classifier model by human interaction and social media. By using a deep learning framework - TensorFlow, it will be easy to reuse the framework to adopt with many devices and applications.",

    "abstract": "Fingerprint is a common biometric used for authentication and verification of an individual. These images are degraded when fingers are wet, dirty, dry or wounded and due to the failure of the sensors, etc. The extraction of the fingerprint from a degraded image requires denoising and inpainting. We propose to address these problems with an end-to-end trainable Convolutional Neural Network based architecture called FPD-M-net, by posing the fingerprint denoising and inpainting problem as a segmentation (foreground) task. Our architecture is based on the M-net with a change: structure similarity loss function, used for better extraction of the fingerprint from the noisy background. Our method outperforms the baseline method and achieves an overall 3rd rank in the Chalearn LAP Inpainting Competition Track 3 - Fingerprint Denoising and Inpainting, ECCV 2018",

In this paper we present a solution, named BitCracker, to attempt the decryption, by means of a dictionary attack, of memory units encrypted by BitLocker with a user supplied password or the recovery password. To that purpose, we resort to GPU (Graphics Processing Units) that are, by now, widely used as general-purpose coprocessors in high performance computing applications. BitLocker decryption process requires the computation of a very large number of SHA- 256 hashes and also AES, so we propose a very fast solution, highly tuned for Nvidia GPU, for both of them. We analyze the performance of our CUDA implementation on several Nvidia GPUs and we carry out a comparison of our SHA-256 hash with the Hashcat password cracker tool. Finally, we present our OpenCL version, recently released as a plugin of the John The Ripper tool.",

Based on the non-convex problem, different convexification technologies, such as change of variables, successive linearization, trust regions and virtual control, are discussed to convert the original problem into the formulation of successive convex programming. Because of the free final-time, successive linearization is performed iteratively for the nonconvex terminal state constraints. After the convexification process, each of problems becomes a convex problem, which can be solved effectively. An augmented objective function is introduced to ensure the convergence performance and effectiveness of our algorithm. After that, algorithms are designed to solve the discrete sub-problems in a successive solution procedure. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our algorithms.",

Currently, web applications focus resources towards the preventative side of security. Whilst prevention is an essential part of the security process, developers must also implement a level of attack awareness into their web applications. Being able to detect when an attack is occurring provides applications with the ability to execute responses against malicious users in an attempt to slow down or deter their attacks. This research seeks to improve web application security by identifying malicious behaviour from within the context of web applications using our tool BlackWatch. The tool is a Python-based application which analyses suspicious events occurring within client web applications, with the objective of identifying malicious patterns of behaviour. Based on the results from a preliminary study, BlackWatch was effective at detecting attacks from both authenticated, and unauthenticated users. Furthermore, user tests with developers indicated BlackWatch was user friendly, and was easy to integrate into existing applications. Future work seeks to develop the BlackWatch solution further for public release.",

In this work, we focus on understanding the risks of abusing embeddings of ML models, an important and popular way of using ML. To show the consequence, we reveal several kinds of channels in which embeddings are accidentally leaked. As our study shows, a face verification system deployed by a government organization leaking only distance to authentic users allows an attacker to exactly recover the embedding of the verifier's pre-installed photo. Further, as we discovered, with the leaked embedding, attackers can easily recover the input photo with negligible quality losses, indicating devastating consequences to users' privacy. This is achieved with our devised GAN-like structure model, which showed 93.65% success rate on popular face embedding model under black box assumption.",

    "abstract": "The performance of a biometric system that relies on a single biometric modality (e.g., fingerprints only) is often stymied by various factors such as poor data quality or limited scalability. Multibiometric systems utilize the principle of fusion to combine information from multiple sources in order to improve recognition accuracy whilst addressing some of the limitations of single-biometric systems. The past two decades have witnessed the development of a large number of biometric fusion schemes. This paper presents an overview of biometric fusion with specific focus on three questions: what to fuse, when to fuse, and how to fuse. A comprehensive review of techniques incorporating ancillary information in the biometric recognition pipeline is also presented. In this regard, the following topics are discussed: (i) incorporating data quality in the biometric recognition pipeline; (ii) combining soft biometric attributes with primary biometric identifiers; (iii) utilizing contextual information to improve biometric recognition accuracy; and (iv) performing continuous authentication using ancillary information. In addition, the use of information fusion principles for presentation attack detection and multibiometric cryptosystems is also discussed. Finally, some of the research challenges in biometric fusion are enumerated. The purpose of this article is to provide readers a comprehensive overview of the role of information fusion in biometrics.",

While the cryptographic community has significantly progressed lightweight (in terms of area overhead) security primitives for low cost and power efficient hardware implementations, lightweight software implementations of security primitives for resource constrained devices are less investigated. Especially, the problem of providing security for intermittently powered computational devices is unexplored. In this paper, we illustrate the unique challenges posed by an emerging class of intermittently powered and energy constrained computational IoT devices for engineering security solutions. We focus on the construction and evaluation of a basic hash primitive---both existing cryptographic hash functions and non-cryptographic hash functions built upon lightweight block ciphers. We provide software implementation benchmarks for eight primitives on a low power and resource limited computational device, and outline an execution model for these primitives under intermittent powering.",

For these expensive optimization tasks, surrogate model-based optimization is frequently applied as it features a good evaluation efficiency. While a combination of both procedures appears as a valuable solution, the definition of adequate distance measures for the surrogate modeling process is difficult. In this study, we will extend cartesian genetic programming of artificial neural networks by the use of surrogate model-based optimization. We propose different distance measures and test our algorithm on a replicable benchmark task. The results indicate that we can significantly increase the evaluation efficiency and that a phenotypic distance, which is based on the behavior of the associated neural networks, is most promising.",

To bridge the gap, this paper accordingly reviews and compares the key characteristics of modalities, contrasts the metrics used to evaluate system performance, and highlights the divergence in critical vulnerabilities, attacks and defenses for TBS and WBS. It further discusses how these factors affect the design considerations for WBS, the open challenges and future directions of research in these areas.

However, this approach creates considerable complexity in managing trust relationships for both the cloud service providers and their clients. Poor management of trust in federated identity management systems brings with it many security, privacy and interoperability issues, which contributes to the reluctance of organizations to move their critical identity data to the cloud.

Our proposed OSV includes three steps: feature learning, active learning, and final verification. We benefit from transfer learning using a pre-trained CNN for feature learning. We also propose SVM-based active learning for each user to separate his genuine signatures from the random forgeries. We finally used the SVMs to verify the authenticity of the questioned signature. We examined our proposed active transfer learning method on UTSig: A Persian offline signature dataset. We achieved near 13% improvement compared to the random selection of instances. Our results also showed 1% improvement over the state-of-the-art method in which a fully supervised setting with five more labeled instances per user was used.",

Expander graphs are known to have excellent expansion properties and thus they also have very good mixing properties. All requirements for a good MAC are satisfied in our method and a discussion about collisions and preimage resistance is also part of this work. The outputs closely approximate the uniform distribution and the results we get are indistinguishable from random sequences of bits. Exact formulas for timing are given in term of number of operations per bit of input. Based on the tests, our method for implementing DMAC shows good efficiency in comparison to other techniques. 4 operations per bit of input can be achieved. The algorithm is very flexible and it works with messages of any length. Many existing algorithms output a fixed length tag, while our constructions allow generation of an arbitrary length output, which is a big advantage.",

It has drawn significant attention of the researchers from both academia and industries. Particularly, incorporating SDN in Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) applications indicates promising benefits in terms of dealing with challenges like traffic management, authentication, energy efficiency etc. while enhancing administrative control. This paper presents a novel framework for Software Defined WBAN (SDWBAN), which brings the concept of SDN technology into WBAN applications. By decoupling the control plane from data plane and having more programmatic control would assist to overcome the current lacking and challenges of WBAN. Therefore, we provide a conceptual framework for SDWBAN with packet flow model and a future direction of research pertaining to SDWBAN.",

The detection of compromised devices, as well as the collection and preservation of evidence regarding alleged malicious behavior in IoT networks emerge as a areas of high priority. This paper presents a blockchain-based solution, which is designed for the smart home domain, dealing with the collection and preservation of digital forensic evidence. The system utilizes a private forensic evidence database, where the captured evidence is stored, along with a permissioned blockchain that allows providing security services like integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation, so that the evidence can be used in a court of law. The blockchain stores evidences' metadata, which are critical for providing the aforementioned services, and interacts via smart contracts with the different entities involved in an investigation process, including Internet service providers, law enforcement agencies and prosecutors. A high-level architecture of the blockchain-based solution is presented that allows tackling the unique challenges posed by the need for digitally handling forensic evidence collected from IoT networks.",

We consider the fundamental limits for covert communications via packet insertion over packet channels whose packet timings are governed by a renewal process of rate $\\lambda$. Authorized transmitter Jack sends packets to authorized receiver Steve, and covert transmitter Alice wishes to transmit packets to covert receiver Bob without being detected by watchful adversary Willie. Willie cannot authenticate the source of the packets. Hence, he looks for statistical anomalies in the packet stream from Jack to Steve to attempt detection of unauthorized packet insertion. First, we consider a special case where the packet timings are governed by a Poisson process and we show that Alice can covertly insert $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\lambda T})$ packets for Bob in a time interval of length $T$; conversely, if Alice inserts $\\omega(\\sqrt{\\lambda T})$, she will be detected by Willie with high probability.

Here we present a protocol for cryptographic key distribution over a public network via photon-counting compressive imaging system with watermarking, which utilizes watermarking technique to distribute secure keys, and uses reconstructed images for simultaneous identity authentication and tampering identification. The watermark is embedded in the rearranged compressed measurements of the object, and then the signal is transmitted through a public network. At the receiving terminal, the legitimate users can easily extract the watermark as the cryptographic key by using initial keys and the variance characteristic of random measurements. Artificial tampering and attacks can be detected by the accurately retrieved images.

In this area, extracting effective statistical characteristics from a JPEG image for classification remains a challenge. Effective features are designed manually in traditional methods, suggesting that extensive labor-consuming research and derivation is required. In this paper, we propose a novel image tampering detection method based on deep multi-scale discriminative networks (MSD-Nets). The multi-scale module is designed to automatically extract multiple features from the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficient histograms of the JPEG image. This module can capture the characteristic information in different scale spaces. In addition, a discriminative module is also utilized to improve the detection effect of the networks in those difficult situations when the first compression quality (QF1) is higher than the second one (QF2). A special network in this module is designed to distinguish the small statistical difference between authentic and tampered regions in these cases. Finally, a probability map can be obtained and the specific tampering area is located using the last classification results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in both quantitative and qualitative metrics when compared with state-of-the-art approaches.",

This calls for formal and automated verification techniques that exhaustively explore all possible intruder behaviors and that scale well. The symbolic approach offers rigorous, mathematical frameworks and automated tools to analyze security protocols. Based on well-designed abstractions, it has allowed for large-scale formal analyses of real-life protocols such as TLS 1.3 and mobile telephony protocols.

Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) guarantee the provenance, authenticity and traceability of data by providing a transparent, immutable and verifiable record of transactions while creating a peer-to-peer secure platform for storing and exchanging information.

We propose a protocol based on pulse-position modulation and multi-level coding that allows one to use traditional quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols while ensuring covertness, in the sense that no statistical test by the adversary can detect the presence of communication better than a random guess. When run over a bosonic channel, our protocol can leverage existing discrete-modulated continuous variable protocols.

The two parameters, namely, writer specific acceptance threshold and optimal feature set to be used for authenticating the writer are selected based on minimum equal error rate (EER) attained during parameter fixation phase using the training signature samples. This is in variation to current techniques for OSV, which are primarily writer independent, in which a common set of features and acceptance threshold are chosen.

Although it is clear how currency units are generated and transacted on, it is unclear how to use the infrastructure of permissionless blockchains to manage other assets than the blockchain's currency units (e.g., cars, houses, etc). In this paper, we propose a global asset management system by unifying permissioned and permissionless blockchains. A governmental permissioned blockchain authenticates the registration of end-user assets through smart contract deployments on a permissionless blockchain. Afterwards, end-users can transact on their assets through smart contract function calls (e.g., sell a car, rent a room in a house, etc). In return, end-users get paid in currency units of the same blockchain or other blockchains through atomic cross-chain transactions and governmental offices receive taxes on these transactions in cryptocurrency units.",

In this paper, we propose a refined hierarchical knowledge structure to model vocabulary knowledge, which enables us to automatically organize the authentic and up-to-date learning materials collected from the internet. Based on this knowledge structure, we then introduce a hybrid approach to recommend learning materials that adapts to a student's language level. We evaluate our work with an online Japanese learning tool and the results suggest adding adaptivity into material recommendation significantly increases student engagement.",

For example, authentic telepresence in Augmented Reality requires faces to be displayed and relit consistent with the observer's scene lighting. We investigate end-to-end deep learning architectures that both de-light and relight an image of a human face. Our model decomposes the input image into intrinsic components according to a diffuse physics-based image formation model. We enable non-diffuse effects including cast shadows and specular highlights by predicting a residual correction to the diffuse render. To train and evaluate our model, we collected a portrait database of 21 subjects with various expressions and poses. Each sample is captured in a controlled light stage setup with 32 individual light sources. Our method creates precise and believable relighting results and generalizes to complex illumination conditions and challenging poses, including when the subject is not looking straight at the camera.",

    "abstract": "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) separates the network control plane and data plane, which provides a network-wide view with centralized control (in the control plane) and programmable network configuration for data plane injected by SDN applications (in the application plane). With these features, a number of drawbacks of the traditional network architectures such as static configuration, non-scalability and low efficiency can be effectively avoided. However, SDN also brings with it some new security challenges, such as single-point failure of the control plane, malicious flows from applications, exposed network-wide resources and a vulnerable channel between the control plane and the data plane. In this paper, we design a monolithic security mechanism for SDN based on Blockchain. Our mechanism decentralizes the control plane to overcome single-point failure while maintaining a network-wide view. The mechanism also guarantees the authenticity, traceability, and accountability of application flows, and hence secures the programmable configuration. Moreover, the mechanism provides a fine-grained access control of network-wide resources and a secure controller-switch channel to further protect resources and communication in SDN.",

The traditional provisioning methods of IoT devices are facing several issues, either about user experience or privacy harvesting.

We provide a solution to make the U2F device that has been trusted by the cloud in the distribution process, via WiFi or its side channel, to provision the new IoT device. Further, subsequent device settings modification, setting update, and owner transfer can also be performed by using a U2F device that has been trusted to improve security and provide a better user experience. This could provide helpful user friendliness to some valuable new application scenarios in IoT, such as smart hotel. Users could migrate the whole authentication of smart devices into a new site by simply inserting the universal cryptographic token into the secure gateway and authorizing by pressing the user-presence button on the token. Besides, the relevant unbinding process could also be done with a single cryptographic operation signed by the cryptographic token.",

These methods ensure that selected sentences share n-grams with the test set so the NMT model can be adapted to translate it. Performing data selection on back-translated data creates new challenges as the source-side may contain noise originated by the model used in the back-translation. Hence, finding n-grams present in the test set become more difficult. Despite that, in our work we show that adapting a model with a selection of synthetic data is an useful approach.",

In a series of computational experiments, we highlight how information in the environment can be used to build and align conceptual systems. Unlike supervised learning, the learning problem becomes easier the more concepts and systems there are to master. The key insight is that each concept has a unique signature within one conceptual system (e.g., images) that is recapitulated in other systems (e.g., text or audio). As predicted, children's early concepts form readily aligned systems.",

We use MBDA for the detection and troubleshooting of network problems in a campus-wide Wi-Fi network. Data includes a seven-year trace (from 2012 to 2018) of the network's most recent activity, with approximately 3,000 distinct access points, 40,000 authenticated users, and 600,000 distinct Wi-Fi stations. This is the longest and largest Wi-Fi trace known to date. To analyze this data, we propose learning and visualization procedures that extend MBDA. These procedures result in a methodology that allows network analysts to identify problems and diagnose and troubleshoot them, optimizing the network performance. In the paper, we go through the entire workflow of the approach, illustrating its application in detail and discussing processing times for parallel hardware.",

If the user is permitted to use the RAC on a managed host, launching the RAC is authorized and access to protected network resources may be given, e.g., to internal networks, servers, or the Internet. xRAC simplifies traffic control as the traffic of a RAC has a unique IPv6 address so that it can be easily identified in the network. The architecture of xRAC reuses standard technologies, protocols, and infrastructure. Those are the Docker virtualization platform and 802.1X including EAP-over-UDP and RADIUS. Thus, xRAC improves network security without modifying core parts of applications, hosts, and infrastructure. In this paper, we review the technological background of xRAC, explain its architecture, discuss selected use cases, and investigate on the performance. To demonstrate the feasibility of xRAC, we implement it based on standard components with only a few modifications. Finally, we validate xRAC through experiments.",

This so-called camera fingerprint gives rise to different applications, such as image forensics and authentication. However, if images are publicly available, an adversary can estimate the fingerprint from her victim and plant it into spurious images. The concept of fragile camera fingerprints addresses this attack by exploiting asymmetries in data access: While the camera owner will always have access to a full fingerprint from uncompressed images, the adversary has typically access to compressed images and thus only to a truncated fingerprint. The security of this defense, however, has not been systematically explored yet. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of fragile camera fingerprints under attack. A series of theoretical and practical tests demonstrate that fragile camera fingerprints allow a reliable device identification for common compression levels in an adversarial environment.",

    "abstract": "Until two decades ago, industrial networks were deemed secure due to physical separation from public networks. An abundance of successful attacks proved that assumption wrong. Intrusion detection solutions for industrial application need to meet certain requirements that differ from home- and office-environments, such as working without feedback to the process and compatibility with legacy systems. Industrial systems are commonly used for several decades, updates are often difficult and expensive. Furthermore, most industrial protocols do not have inherent authentication or encryption mechanisms, allowing for easy lateral movement of an intruder once the perimeter is breached. In this work, an algorithm for motif discovery in time series, Matrix Profiles, is used to detect outliers in the timing behaviour of an industrial process. This process was monitored in an experimental environment, containing ground truth labels after attacks were performed. Furthermore, the graph representations of a different industrial data set that has been emulated are used to detect malicious activities. These activities can be derived from anomalous communication patterns, represented as edges in the graph. Finally, an integration concept for both methods is proposed.",

Besides, a partially stacking method is designed to appropriately combine the semi-steady and steady-state RFFs of ZigBee devices. The proposed Partially Stacking-based Convolutional DAE (PSC-DAE) aims at reconstructing a high-SNR signal as well as device identification. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), PSCDAE can improve the identification accuracy by 14% to 23.5% at low SNRs (from -10 dB to 5 dB) under Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) corrupted channels. Even at SNR = 10 dB, the identification accuracy is as high as 97.5%.",

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 is becoming more and more important for manufacturers as the developments in the area of Internet of Things advance. Another technology gaining more attention is data stream processing systems. Although such streaming frameworks seem to be a natural fit for Industry 4.0 scenarios, their application in this context is still low. The contributions in this paper are threefold. Firstly, we present industry findings that we derived from site inspections with a focus on Industry 4.0. Moreover, our view on Industry 4.0 and important related aspects is elaborated. As a third contribution, we illustrate our opinion on why data stream processing technologies could act as an enabler for Industry 4.0 and point out possible obstacles on this way.",

    "abstract": "A few years ago, Automotive area in the IoT was seen as theoretical concept and today we are already seeing the possibilities of not only driverless cars, but applications of IoT in the intelligent vehicles including parking, maintaining environment, protecting lives and smoothing the flow vehicle movements. We have realized the urgent need of using simple and efficient secure protocol in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) to be practical in the fast mobility of the network nodes, and taking advantage of the existence of base stations gateways along the road to inherit the protocol to different VANETs, this will reduce the initialization of communication overhead time and the security keys initialization each time a node passes to new base station zone. In this research, we applied security protocol used in sensor networks to achieve security in VANET, the simulation analysis shows that secure practical communication is achieved which can be inherited to other sub VANETs. The contribution of this article is enhancing proposed protocols with as less cryptography computation overhead as possible to make it applicable in the high mobility nature of VANET using security primitives; which guarantees security while allowing fast authenticating during vehicle passing one VANET to the next one depending on its direction in the transportation networks.",

    "abstract": "Humanness is core to speech interface design. Yet little is known about how users conceptualise perceptions of humanness and how people define their interaction with speech interfaces through this. To map these perceptions n=21 participants held dialogues with a human and two speech interface based intelligent personal assistants, and then reflected and compared their experiences using the repertory grid technique. Analysis of the constructs show that perceptions of humanness are multidimensional, focusing on eight key themes: partner knowledge set, interpersonal connection, linguistic content, partner performance and capabilities, conversational interaction, partner identity and role, vocal qualities and behavioral affordances. Through these themes, it is clear that users define the capabilities of speech interfaces differently to humans, seeing them as more formal, fact based, impersonal and less authentic. Based on the findings, we discuss how the themes help to scaffold, categorise and target research and design efforts, considering the appropriateness of emulating humanness.",

    "abstract": "Solid state drives have a number of interesting characteristics. However, there are numerous file system and storage design issues for SSDs that impact the performance and device endurance. Many flash-oriented and flash-friendly file systems introduce significant write amplification issue and GC overhead that results in shorter SSD lifetime and necessity to use the NAND flash overprovisioning. SSDFS file system introduces several authentic concepts and mechanisms: logical segment, logical extent, segment's PEBs pool, Main/Diff/Journal areas in the PEB's log, Diff-On-Write approach, PEBs migration scheme, hot/warm data self-migration, segment bitmap, hybrid b-tree, shared dictionary b-tree, shared extents b-tree. Combination of all suggested concepts are able: (1) manage write amplification in smart way, (2) decrease GC overhead, (3) prolong SSD lifetime, and (4) provide predictable file system's performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a proof of concept for using SRAM based Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to generate private keys for IoT devices. PUFs are utilized, as there is inadequate protection for secret keys stored in the memory of the IoT devices. We utilize a custom-made Arduino mega shield to extract the fingerprint from SRAM chip on demand. We utilize the concepts of ternary states to exclude the cells which are easily prone to flip, allowing us to extract stable bits from the fingerprint of the SRAM. Using the custom-made software for our SRAM device, we can control the error rate of the PUF to achieve an adjustable memory-based PUF for key generation. We utilize several fuzzy extractor techniques based on using different error correction coding methods to generate secret keys from the SRAM PUF, and study the trade-off between the false authentication rate and false rejection rate of the PUF.",

    "abstract": "For nonlinear time-delay systems, domains of attraction are rarely studied despite their importance for technological applications. The present paper provides methodological hints for the determination of an upper bound on the radius of attraction by numerical means. Thereby, the respective Banach space for initial functions has to be selected and primary initial functions have to be chosen. The latter are used in time-forward simulations to determine a first upper bound on the radius of attraction. Thereafter, this upper bound is refined by secondary initial functions, which result a posteriori from the preceding simulations. Additionally, a bifurcation analysis should be undertaken. This analysis results in a possible improvement of the previous estimation. An example of a time-delayed swing equation demonstrates the various aspects.",

    "abstract": "Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are devices that exploit small variations in a manufacturing process to create unique and stable identifying characteristics with applications ranging from intellectual property protection and device authentication to secret key exchange. In this work, we present a novel PUF design composed of a chaotic Boolean network implemented on a field-programmable gate array, capable of generating challenge-response pairs in as little as 10 ns. In contrast to other designs, we collect multiple response bits per challenge, and demonstrate an exponential scaling of entropy with network size. We find a high degree of uniqueness and reliability from the design, respectively characterized by $\\mu_{inter}$ = 0.41 $\\pm$ 0.02 and $\\mu_{intra}$ = 0.02 $\\pm$ 0.01 for a 256-node network. We further show that the network is chaotic and resistant to a third-party machine learning attack, while exhibiting moderate temperature variation, potentially paving the way for commercial use.",

    "abstract": "Fingerprint recognition has been utilized for cellphone authentication, airport security and beyond. Many different features and algorithms have been proposed to improve fingerprint recognition. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for fingerprint recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which can jointly learn the feature representation and perform recognition. We train our model on a large-scale fingerprint recognition dataset, and improve over previous approaches in terms of accuracy. Our proposed model is able to achieve a very high recognition accuracy on a well-known fingerprint dataset. We believe this framework can be widely used for biometrics recognition tasks, making more scalable and accurate systems possible. We have also used a visualization technique to highlight the important areas in an input fingerprint image, that mostly impact the recognition results.",

    "abstract": "Traditional distributed transaction processing (TP) systems, such as replicated databases, faced difficulties in getting wide adoption for scenarios of enterprise integration due to the level of mutual trust required. Ironically, public blockchains, which promised to solve the problem of mutual trust in collaborative processes, suffer from issues like scalability, probabilistic transaction finality, and lack of data confidentiality. To tackle these issues, permissioned blockchains were introduced as an alternative approach combining the positives of the two worlds and avoiding their drawbacks. However, no sufficient analysis has been done to emphasize their actual capabilities regarding TP. In this paper, we identify a suitable collection of TP criteria to analyze permissioned blockchains and apply them to a prominent set of these systems. Finally, we compare the derived properties and provide general conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Identity management systems (IDMSs) are widely used to provision user identities while managing authentication, authorization, and data sharing within organizations and on the web. Traditional identity systems typically suffer from single points of failure, lack of interoperability, and privacy issues, such as enabling mass data collection and user tracking. Blockchain technology has the potential to alleviate these concerns: it can support the ability for users to control the custody of their own identifiers and credentials, enabling novel data ownership and governance models with built-in control and consent mechanisms. Hence, blockchain-based IDMSs, which could benefit both users and businesses, are beginning to proliferate. This work categorizes these systems into a taxonomy based on differences in blockchain architectures, governance models, and other salient features. Context is provided for the taxonomy through the description of related terms, emerging standards, and use cases while highlighting relevant security and privacy considerations.",
