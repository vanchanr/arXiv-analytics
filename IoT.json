    "abstract": "Network traffic generation is one of the primary techniques that is used to design and analyze the performance of network security systems. However, due to the diversity of IoT networks in terms of devices, applications and protocols, the traditional network traffic generator tools are unable to generate the IoT specific protocols traffic. Hence, the traditional traffic generator tools cannot be used for designing and testing the performance of IoT-specific security solutions. In order to design an IoT-based traffic generation framework, two main challenges include IoT device modelling and generating the IoT normal and attack traffic simultaneously. Therefore, in this work, we propose an open-source framework for IoT traffic generation which supports the two widely used IoT application layer protocols, i.e., MQTT and CoAP. The proposed framework allows a user to create an IoT use case, add customized IoT devices into it and generate normal and malicious IoT traffic over a real-time network. Furthermore, we set up a real-time IoT smart home use case to manifest the applicability of the proposed framework for developing the security solutions for IoT smart home by emulating the real world IoT devices. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can be effectively used to develop better security solutions for IoT networks without physically deploying the real-time use case.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has since seen a growing interest in architectural design and adaptive frameworks to promote the connection between heterogeneous IoT devices and IoT systems. The most widely favoured software architecture in IoT is the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), which aims to provide a loosely coupled systems to leverage the use and reuse of IoT services at the middle-ware layer, to minimise system integration problems. However, despite the flexibility offered by SOA, the challenges of integrating, scaling and ensuring resilience in IoT systems persist. One of the key causes of poor integration in IoT systems is the lack of an intelligent, connection-aware framework to support interaction in IoT systems. This paper reviews existing architectural frameworks for integrating IoT devices and identifies the key areas that require further research improvements. The paper concludes by proposing a possible solution based on microservice. The proposed IoT integration framework benefits from an intelligent API layer that employs an external service assembler, service auditor, service monitor and service router component to coordinate service publishing, subscription, decoupling and service combination within the architecture.",

The main intention behind the IoT is to enable safer living and risk mitigation on different levels of life. With the advent of IoT botnets, the view towards IoT devices has changed from enabler of enhanced living into Internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. IoT botnets has exposed two different glaring issues, 1) A large number of IoT devices are accessible over public Internet. 2) Security (if considered at all) is often an afterthought in the architecture of many wide spread IoT devices. In this article, we briefly outline the anatomy of the IoT botnets and their basic mode of operations. Some of the major DDoS incidents using IoT botnets in recent times along with the corresponding exploited vulnerabilities will be discussed. We also provide remedies and recommendations to mitigate IoT related cyber risks and briefly illustrate the importance of cyber insurance in the modern connected world.",

A blockchain is a series of blocks, each block is linked to its previous blocks. Every block has the cryptographic hash code, previous block hash, and its data. The transactions in BC are the basic units that are used to transfer data between IoT nodes. The IoT nodes are different kind of physical but smart devices with embedded sensors, actuators, programs and able to communicate with other IoT nodes. The role of BC in IoT is to provide a procedure to process secured records of data through IoT nodes. BC is a secured technology that can be used publicly and openly. IoT requires this kind of technology to allow secure communication among IoT nodes in heterogeneous environment. The transactions in BC could be traced and explored through anyone who are authenticated to communicate within the IoT. The BC in IoT may help to improve the communication security.

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become ubiquitous and are spread across many application domains including the industry, transportation, healthcare, and households. However, the proliferation of the IoT devices has raised the concerns about their security, especially when observing that many manufacturers focus only on the core functionality of their products due to short time to market and low-cost pressures, while neglecting security aspects. Moreover, it does not exist any established or standardized method for measuring and ensuring the security of IoT devices. Consequently, vulnerabilities are left untreated, allowing attackers to exploit IoT devices for various purposes, such as compromising privacy, recruiting devices into a botnet, or misusing devices to perform cryptocurrency mining. In this paper, we present a practical Host-based Anomaly DEtection System for IoT (HADES-IoT) that represents the last line of defense. HADES-IoT has proactive detection capabilities, provides tamper-proof resistance, and it can be deployed on a wide range of Linux-based IoT devices. The main advantage of HADES-IoT is its low performance overhead, which makes it suitable for the IoT domain, where state-of-the-art approaches cannot be applied due to their high-performance demands. We deployed HADES-IoT on seven IoT devices to evaluate its effectiveness and performance overhead. Our experiments show that HADES-IoT achieved 100% effectiveness in the detection of current IoT malware such as VPNFilter and IoTReaper; while on average, requiring only 5.5% of available memory and causing only a low CPU load.",

    "abstract": "For a seamless deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a need for self-organizing solutions to overcome key IoT challenges that include data processing, resource management, coexistence with existing wireless networks, and improved IoT-wide event detection. One of the most promising solutions to address these challenges is via the use of innovative learning frameworks that will enable the IoT devices to operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. However, developing learning mechanisms for the IoT requires coping with unique IoT properties in terms of resource constraints, heterogeneity, and strict quality-of-service requirements. In this paper, a number of emerging learning frameworks suitable for IoT applications are presented. In particular, the advantages, limitations, IoT applications, and key results pertaining to machine learning, sequential learning, and reinforcement learning are studied. For each type of learning, the computational complexity, required information, and learning performance are discussed. Then, to handle the heterogeneity of the IoT, a new framework based on the powerful tools of cognitive hierarchy theory is introduced. This framework is shown to efficiently capture the different IoT device types and varying levels of available resources among the IoT devices. In particular, the different resource capabilities of IoT devices are mapped to different levels of rationality in cognitive hierarchy theory, thus enabling the IoT devices to use different learning frameworks depending on their available resources. Finally, key results on the use of cognitive hierarchy theory in the IoT are presented.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices have expanded the horizon of digital forensic investigations by providing a rich set of new evidence sources. IoT devices includes health implants, sports wearables, smart burglary alarms, smart thermostats, smart electrical appliances, and many more. Digital evidence from these IoT devices is often extracted from third party sources, e.g., paired smartphone applications or the devices' back-end cloud services. However vital digital evidence can still reside solely on the IoT device itself. The specifics of the IoT device's hardware is a black-box in many cases due to the lack of proven, established techniques to inspect IoT devices. This paper presents a novel methodology to inspect the internal software activities of IoT devices through their electromagnetic radiation emissions during live device investigation. When a running IoT device is identified at a crime scene, forensically important software activities can be revealed through an electromagnetic side-channel analysis (EM-SCA) attack. By using two representative IoT hardware platforms, this work demonstrates that cryptographic algorithms running on high-end IoT devices can be detected with over 82% accuracy, while minor software code differences in low-end IoT devices could be detected over 90% accuracy using a neural network-based classifier. Furthermore, it was experimentally demonstrated that malicious modification of the stock firmware of an IoT device can be detected through machine learning-assisted EM-SCA techniques. These techniques provide a new investigative vector for digital forensic investigators to inspect IoT devices.",

However, the actual use of IoT over significant timescales has not been empirically analyzed. In other words the reality remains unexplored. Furthermore, despite the variety of IoT verticals, the use of IoT across vertical industries has not been compared. This paper uses a two-year IoT dataset from a major Finnish mobile network operator to investigate different aspects of cellular IoT traffic including temporal evolution and the use of IoT devices across industries. We present a variety of novel findings. For example, our results show that IoT traffic volume per device increased three-fold over the last two years. Additionally, we illustrate diversity in IoT usage among different industries with orders of magnitude differences in traffic volume and device mobility. Though we also note that the daily traffic patterns of all devices can be clustered into only three patterns, differing mainly in the presence and timing of a peak hour. Finally, we illustrate that the share of LTE-enabled IoT devices has remained low at around 2% and 30% of IoT devices are still 2G only.",

    "abstract": "Smart homes, enterprises, and cities are increasingly being equipped with a plethora of Internet of Things (IoT), ranging from smart-lights to security cameras. While IoT networks have the potential to benefit our lives, they create privacy and security challenges not seen with traditional IT networks. Due to the lack of visibility, operators of such smart environments are not often aware of their IoT assets, let alone whether each IoT device is functioning properly safe from cyber-attacks. This thesis is the culmination of our efforts to develop techniques to profile the network behavioral pattern of IoTs, automate IoT classification, deduce their operating context, and detect anomalous behavior indicative of cyber-attacks. We begin this thesis by surveying IoT ecosystem, while reviewing current approaches to vulnerability assessments, intrusion detection, and behavioral monitoring. For our first contribution, we collect traffic traces and characterize the network behavior of IoT devices via attributes from traffic patterns. We develop a robust machine learning-based inference engine trained with these attributes and demonstrate real-time classification of 28 IoT devices with over 99% accuracy. Our second contribution enhances the classification by reducing the cost of attribute extraction while also identifying IoT device states. Prototype implementation and evaluation demonstrate the ability of our supervised machine learning method to detect behavioral changes for five IoT devices. Our third and final contribution develops a modularized unsupervised inference engine that dynamically accommodates the addition of new IoT devices and/or updates to existing ones, without requiring system-wide retraining of the model. We demonstrate via experiments that our model can automatically detect attacks and firmware changes in ten IoT devices with over 94% accuracy.",

Communication of these signals from IoT devices to the IoT cloud will require (lowpass) approximations. Linear signal approximations are well known in the literature. It will be outlined that in many IoT analytics problems, it is desirable that the approximated signals (or their analytics) should always over-predict the exact signals (or their analytics). This distributed nonlinear approximation problem has not been studied before. An algorithm to perform distributed over-predictive signal analytics in the IoT cloud, based on signal approximations by IoT devices, is proposed.

    "abstract": "Remote attestation is a security technique through which a remote trusted party (i.e., Verifier) checks the trustworthiness of a potentially untrusted device (i.e., Prover). In the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, the existing remote attestation protocols propose various approaches to detect the modified software and physical tampering attacks. However, in an interoperable IoT system, in which IoT devices interact autonomously among themselves, an additional problem arises: a compromised IoT service can influence the genuine operation of other invoked service, without changing the software of the latter. In this paper, we propose a protocol for Remote Attestation of Distributed IoT Services (RADIS), which verifies the trustworthiness of distributed IoT services. Instead of attesting the complete memory content of the entire interoperable IoT devices, RADIS attests only the services involved in performing a certain functionality. RADIS relies on a control-flow attestation technique to detect IoT services that perform an unexpected operation due to their interactions with a malicious remote service. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our protocol in validating the integrity status of a distributed IoT service.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitous deployment of low-cost smart devices and widespread use of high-speed wireless networks have led to the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT embraces countless physical objects that have not been involved in the traditional Internet and enables their interaction and cooperation to provide a wide range of IoT applications. Many services in the IoT may require a comprehensive understanding and analysis of data collected through a large number of physical devices that challenges both personal information privacy and the development of IoT. Information privacy in IoT is a broad and complex concept as its understanding and perception differ among individuals and its enforcement requires efforts from both legislation as well as technologies. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art principles of privacy laws, the architectures for IoT and the representative privacy enhancing technologies (PETs). We analyze how legal principles can be supported through a careful implementation of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) at various layers of a layered IoT architecture model to meet the privacy requirements of the individuals interacting with IoT systems. We demonstrate how privacy legislation maps to privacy principles which in turn drives the design of necessary privacy enhancing technologies to be employed in the IoT architecture stack.",

The resulting new IoT MicroMort for calculating IoT risk is tested and validated with real data from the BullGuard's IoT Scanner - over 310,000 scans - and the Garner report on IoT connected devices. Two calculations are developed, the current state of IoT cyber risk and the future forecasts of IoT cyber risk. Our work therefore advances the efforts of integrating cyber risk impact assessments and offer a better understanding of economic impact assessment for IoT cyber risk.",

To enable IoT applications, the communication between IoT devices follows specifications defined by standard developing organizations. In this paper, we present a case study that investigates disclosed insecurities of the popular IoT standard ZigBee, and derive general lessons about security economics in IoT standardization efforts. We discuss the motivation of IoT standardization efforts that are primarily driven from an economic perspective, in which large investments in security are not considered necessary since the consumers do not reward them. Success at the market is achieved by being quick-to-market, providing functional features and offering easy integration for complementors. Nevertheless, manufacturers should not only consider economic reasons but also see their responsibility to protect humans and technological infrastructures from being threatened by insecure IoT products. In this context, we propose a number of recommendations to strengthen the security design in future IoT standardization efforts, ranging from the definition of a precise security model to the enforcement of an update policy.",

By 2030, it is been predicted that the number of IoT devices will exceed the number of human beings on earth. This gives rise to the requirement of middleware platform that can manage IoT devices, intelligently store and process gigantic data generated for building smart applications such as Smart Cities, Smart Healthcare, Smart Industry, and others. At present, market is overwhelming with the number of IoT middleware platforms with specific features. This raises one of the most serious and least discussed challenge for application developer to choose suitable platform for their application development. Across the literature, very little attempt is done in classifying or comparing IoT middleware platforms for the applications. This paper categorizes IoT platforms into four categories namely-publicly traded, open source, developer friendly and end-to-end connectivity. Some of the popular middleware platforms in each category are investigated based on general IoT architecture. Comparison of IoT middleware platforms in each category, based on basic, sensing, communication and application development features is presented. This study can be useful for IoT application developers to select the most appropriate platform according to their application requirement.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) have widely penetrated in different aspects of modern life and many intelligent IoT services and applications are emerging. Recently, federated learning is proposed to train a globally shared model by exploiting a massive amount of user-generated data samples on IoT devices while preventing data leakage. However, the device, statistical and model heterogeneities inherent in the complex IoT environments pose great challenges to traditional federated learning, making it unsuitable to be directly deployed. In this article we advocate a personalized federated learning framework in a cloud-edge architecture for intelligent IoT applications. To cope with the heterogeneity issues in IoT environments, we investigate emerging personalized federated learning methods which are able to mitigate the negative effects caused by heterogeneity in different aspects. With the power of edge computing, the requirements for fast-processing capacity and low latency in intelligent IoT applications can also be achieved. We finally provide a case study of IoT based human activity recognition to demonstrate the effectiveness of personalized federated learning for intelligent IoT applications.",

In this paper, we propose an adversarial machine learning based partial-model attack in the data fusion/aggregation process of IoT by only controlling a small part of the sensing devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of this attack to disrupt the decision making in data fusion with limited control of IoT devices, e.g., the attack success rate reaches 83\\% when the adversary tampers with only 8 out of 20 IoT devices. These results show that the machine learning engine of IoT system is highly vulnerable to attacks even when the adversary manipulates a small portion of IoT devices, and the outcome of these attacks severely disrupts IoT system operations.",

The analysis of challenges in IoT security was conducted based on the review of resources and reports on IoT security, while mapping the relevant solutions/measures for strengthening security to the existing challenges. This mapping assists stakeholders in understanding the IoT security initiatives regarding their business needs and issues. Based on the analysis, we conclude that almost all companies have an understanding of basic security measures as encryption, but do not understand threat surface and not aware of advanced methods of protecting data and devices. The analysis shows that most companies do not have internal experts in IoT security and prefer to outsource security operations to security providers.",

It is believed that IoT will bring up a limitless number of applications and business opportunities that will affect almost every aspect of our life. Research has already been conducted to investigate the challenges that obstruct the realization of IoT along with the promising solutions that pave the way for the acceptance and enabling of IoT. Among the research areas that is of a great importance to making IoT paradigm possible is the presence of a unified programming framework that masks the heterogeneity of the involved devices of the IoT platform. Such a framework guides system developers throughout the IoT application development process. In this paper, we investigate the IoT concept and its high level architecture in general and focus more on the application development aspect. We believe that IoT applications are highly dynamic in nature and thus need to be engineered with the self adaptive and autonomic concepts in mind. Therefore, our proposed IoT software development lifecycle was based on the IBM architecture blueprint for autonomic systems. To cater for the runtime dynamic and heterogeneity aspects of IoT applications, we adopt the MDD paradigm for our proposed development framework. We highlight the core requirements of a resilient development framework that accommodates the necessary concepts and processes for a successful IoT application.",

Moreover, IoTWatcH informs the users with its findings to make them aware of the privacy risks with the IoT app. We implemented IoTWatcH on real IoT applications. Specifically, we analyzed 540 IoT apps to train the NLP model and evaluate its effectiveness. IoTWatcH successfully classifies IoT app data sent to external parties to correct privacy labels with an average accuracy of 94.25%, and flags IoT apps that leak privacy data to unauthorized parties.

For the huge number of IoT devices, a high scalable discovery architecture is required to provide autonomous registration and look-up of IoT resources and services. The architecture should enable dynamic updates when new IoT devices are incorporated into Internet, and changes are made to the existing ones. Nowadays in Internet, the most used discovery architecture is the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS offers a scalable solution through two distributed mechanisms: multicast DNS (mDNS) and DNS Service Directory (DNS-SD). Both mechanisms have been applied to discover resources and services in local IoT domains. However, a full architecture has not still been designed to support global discovery, local directories and a search engine for ubiquitous IoT domains. Moreover, the architecture should provide other transversal functionalities such as a common semantic for describing services and resources, and a service layer for interconnecting with M2M platforms and mobile clients. This paper presents an oriented-service architecture based on DNS to support a global discovery, local directories and a distributed search engine to enable a scalable looking-up of IoT resources and services. The architecture provides two lightweight discovery mechanisms based on mDNS and DNS-SD that have been optimized for the constraints of IoT devices to allow autonomous registration. Moreover, we analyse and provide other relevant elements such semantic description and communications interfaces to support the heterogeneity of IoT devices and clients. All these elements contribute to build a scalable architecture for the discovery and access of heterogeneous and ubiquitous IoT domains.",

The benchmark includes 27 common IoT tasks classified across various functional categories and implemented as reusable micro-benchmarks. Further, we propose four IoT application benchmarks composed from these tasks, and that leverage various dataflow semantics of DSPS. The applications are based on common IoT patterns for data pre-processing, statistical summarization and predictive analytics. These are coupled with four stream workloads sourced from real IoT observations on smart cities and fitness, with peak streams rates that range from 500 to 10000 messages/sec and diverse frequency distributions. We validate the RIoTBench suite for the popular Apache Storm DSPS on the Microsoft Azure public Cloud, and present empirical observations.

From small household devices to large industrial machines, the vision of IoT has made it possible to connect the devices with the physical world around them.

Already, several types of malicious activities exist that attempt to compromise the security and privacy of the IoT devices. One interesting emerging threat vector is the attacks that abuse the use of sensors on IoT devices. IoT devices are vulnerable to sensor-based threats due to the lack of proper security measurements available to control use of sensors by apps. By exploiting the sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, light sensor, etc.) on an IoT device, attackers can extract information from the device, transfer malware to a device, or trigger a malicious activity to compromise the device. In this survey, we explore various threats targeting IoT devices and discuss how their sensors can be abused for malicious purposes. Specifically, we present a detailed survey about existing sensor-based threats to IoT devices and countermeasures that are developed specifically to secure the sensors of IoT devices. Furthermore, we discuss security and privacy issues of IoT devices in the context of sensor-based threats and conclude with future research directions.",

To overcome this problem, energy harvesting offers a viable alternative to autonomously power IoT devices, resulting in a number of battery-less energy harvesting IoTs (or EH-IoTs) appearing in the market in recent years. Standards activities are also underway, which involve wireless protocol design suitable for EH-IoTs as well as testing procedures for various energy harvesting methods. Despite the early commercial and standards activities, IoT sensing, computing and communications under unpredictable power supply still face significant research challenges. This paper systematically surveys recent advances in EH-IoTs from several perspectives. First, it reviews the recent commercial developments for EH-IoT in terms of both products and services, followed by initial standards activities in this space. Then it surveys methods that enable the use of energy harvesting hardware as a proxy for conventional sensors to detect contexts in energy efficient manner. Next it reviews the advancements in efficient checkpointing and timekeeping for intermittently powered IoT devices. We also survey recent research in novel wireless communication techniques for EH-IoTs, such as the applications of reinforcement learning to optimize power allocations on-the-fly under unpredictable energy productions, and packet-less IoT communications and backscatter communication techniques for energy impoverished environments.

    "abstract": "The booming Internet of Things (IoT) market has drawn tremendous interest from cyber attackers. The centralized cloud-based IoT service architecture has serious limitations in terms of security, availability, and scalability, and is subject to single points of failure (SPOF). Recently, accommodating IoT services on blockchains has become a trend for better security, privacy, and reliability. However, blockchain's shortcomings of high cost, low throughput, and long latency make it unsuitable for IoT applications. In this paper, we take a retrospection of existing blockchain-based IoT solutions and propose a framework for efficient blockchain and IoT integration. Following the framework, we design a novel blockchain-assisted decentralized IoT remote accessing system, RS-IoT, which has the advantage of defending IoT devices against zero-day attacks without relying on any trusted third-party. By introducing incentives and penalties enforced by smart contracts, our work enables \"an economic approach\" to thwarting the majority of attackers who aim to achieve monetary gains. Our work presents an example of how blockchain can be used to ensure the fairness of service trading in a decentralized environment and punish misbehaviors objectively. We show the security of RS-IoT via detailed security analyses. Finally, we demonstrate its scalability, efficiency, and usability through a proof-of-concept implementation on the Ethereum testnet blockchain.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of IoT technology, various domains such as smart factories, smart cities and smart cars use the IoT to provide value-added services. In addition, technologies such as MEC and network slicing provide another opportunity for the IoT to support more advanced and real-time services that could not have been previously supported. However, the simple integration of such technologies into the IoT does not take full advantage of MEC and network slicing or the reduction of latency and traffic prioritization, respectively. Therefore, there is a strong need for an efficient integration mechanism for IoT platforms to maximize the benefit of using such technologies. In this article, we introduce a novel architectural framework that enables the virtualization of an IoT platform with minimum functions to support specific IoT services and host the instance in an edge node, close to the end-user. As the instance provides its service at the edge node where the MEC node and network slice are located, the traffic for the end-user does not need to traverse back to the cloud. This architecture guarantees not only low latency but also efficient management of IoT services at the edge node. To show the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we conduct an experimental evaluation by comparing the transmission time of both IoT services running on the central cloud and those using sliced IoT functions in the edge gateway. The results show that the proposed architecture provides two times faster transmission time than that from the conventional cloud-based IoT platform.",

To address such concerns, we propose IoT Notary, a framework to ensure trust in IoT systems and applications. IoT Notary provides secure log sealing on live sensor data to produce a verifiable `proof-of-integrity,' based on which a verifier can attest that captured sensor data adheres to the published data-capturing rules. IoT Notary is an integral part of TIPPERS, a smart space system that has been deployed at UCI to provide various real-time location-based services in the campus. IoT Notary imposes nominal overheads for verification, thereby users can verify their data of one day in less than two seconds.",

This paper proposes FLIP- FLexible IoT Path Programming Framework for Large-scale IoT. The distinctive feature of FLIP is that it focuses on the IoT fabric from the perspective of user requirements and uses SDN techniques along with DPI technology to efficiently fulfill the user requirements and establish datapath in the network in an automated and distributed manner. FLIP utilizes SDN structure to optimize network utilization through in-network computing and automated datapath establishment, also hiding network complexity along the way. We evaluated our framework through experiments, and results indicate that FLIP has the potential to fulfill user requirements in an automated fashion and optimize network utilization.",

Different researchers and organizations proposed different architectures under a variety of classifications, mainly: conceptual, standard and, industrial or commercial adoption.

Nowadays, IoT is considered as one of the main technologies which contribute towards reshaping our daily lives in the next decade. IoT unlocks many exciting new opportunities in a variety of applications in research and industry domains. However, many have complained about the absence of the real-world IoT data. Unsurprisingly, a common question that arises regularly nowadays is \"Does the IoT already exist?\". So far, little has been known about the real-world situation on IoT, its attributes, the presentation of data and user interests. To answer this question, in this work, we conduct an in-depth analytical investigation on real IoT data. More specifically, we identify IoT data sources over the Web and develop a crawler engine to collect large-scale real-world IoT data for the first time. We make the results of our work available to the public in order to assist the community in the future research. In particular, we collect the data of nearly two million Internet connected objects and study trends in IoT using a real-world query set from an IoT search engine. Based on the collected data and our analysis, we identify the typical characteristics of IoT data. The most intriguing finding of our study is that IoT data is mainly disseminated using Web Mapping while the emerging IoT solutions such as the Web of Things, are currently not well adopted.

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) application deployment requires the allocation of resources such as virtual machines, storage, and network elements that must be deployed over distinct infrastructures such as cloud computing, Cloud of Things (CoT), datacenters and backbone networks. For massive IoT data acquisition, a gateway-based data aggregation approach is commonly used featuring sensor/ actuator seamless access and providing cache/ buffering and preprocessing functionality. In this perspective , gateways acting as producers need to allocate network resources to send IoT data to consumers. In this paper, it is proposed a Publish/-Subscribe (PubSub) quality of service (QoS) aware framework (PSIoT-Orch) that orchestrates IoT traffic and allocates network resources between aggregates and consumers for massive IoT traffic. PSIoT-Orch schedules IoT data flows based on its configured QoS requirements. Additionally , the framework allocates network resources (LSP/ bandwidth) over a controlled backbone network with limited and constrained resources between IoT data users and consumers. Network resources are allocated using a Bandwidth Allocation Model (BAM) to achieve efficient network resource allocation for scheduled IoT data streams. PSIoT-Orch adopts an ICN (Information-Centric Network) PubSub architecture approach to handle IoT data transfers requests among framework components. The proposed framework aims at gathering the inherent advantages of an ICN-centric approach using a PubSub message scheme while allocating resources efficiently keeping QoS awareness and handling restricted network resources (bandwidth) for massive IoT traffic.",

    "abstract": "The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is facing significant scalability and security challenges. On the one hand, IoT devices are \"weak\" and need external assistance. Edge computing provides a promising direction addressing the deficiency of centralized cloud computing in scaling massive number of devices. On the other hand, IoT devices are also relatively \"vulnerable\" facing malicious hackers due to resource constraints. The emerging blockchain and smart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT and edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and prototype an edge-IoT framework named \"EdgeChain\" based on blockchain and smart contracts. The core idea is to integrate a permissioned blockchain and the internal currency or \"coin\" system to link the edge cloud resource pool with each IoT device' account and resource usage, and hence behavior of the IoT devices. EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control how much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on pre-defined rules on priority, application types and past behaviors. Smart contracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device behavior in a non-deniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and transactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ideas. The results show that while gaining the security benefits of blockchain and smart contracts, the cost of integrating them into EdgeChain is within a reasonable and acceptable range.",

The situations include but not limited to the followings: 1) when initializing an IoT device, 2) when trying to control an IoT device which is initialized and registered by another person, and 3) when trying to control an IoT device out of many of the same type. We tackle these situations by proposing a new association-free communication method, QuickTalk. QuickTalk lets a user device such as a smartphone pinpoint and activate an IoT device with the help of an IR transmitter and communicate with the pinpointed IoT device through the broadcast channel of WiFi. By the nature of its association-free communication, QuickTalk allows a user device to immediately give a command to a specific IoT device in proximity even when the IoT device is uninitialized, unregistered to the control interface of the user, or registered but being physically confused with others. Our experiments of QuickTalk implemented on Raspberry Pi 2 devices show that the end-to-end delay of QuickTalk is upper bounded by 2.5 seconds and its median is only about 0.74 seconds. We further confirm that even when an IoT device has ongoing data sessions, QuickTalk can still establish a reliable communication channel to the IoT device with little impact to the ongoing sessions.",

The participating nodes in IoT networks are usually resource-constrained, which makes them luring targets for cyber attacks. In this regard, extensive efforts have been made to address the security and privacy issues in IoT networks primarily through traditional cryptographic approaches. However, the unique characteristics of IoT nodes render the existing solutions insufficient to encompass the entire security spectrum of the IoT networks. This is, at least in part, because of the resource constraints, heterogeneity, massive real-time data generated by the IoT devices, and the extensively dynamic behavior of the networks. Therefore, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, which are able to provide embedded intelligence in the IoT devices and networks, are leveraged to cope with different security problems. In this paper, we systematically review the security requirements, attack vectors, and the current security solutions for the IoT networks. We then shed light on the gaps in these security solutions that call for ML and DL approaches. We also discuss in detail the existing ML and DL solutions for addressing different security problems in IoT networks. At last, based on the detailed investigation of the existing solutions in the literature, we discuss the future research directions for ML- and DL-based IoT security.",

    "abstract": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) refers to a massively heterogeneous network formed through smart devices connected to the Internet. In the wake of disruptive IoT with a huge amount and variety of data, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) mechanisms will play a pivotal role to bring intelligence to the IoT networks. Among other aspects, ML and DL can play an essential role in addressing the challenges of resource management in large-scale IoT networks. In this article, we conduct a systematic and in-depth survey of the ML- and DL-based resource management mechanisms in cellular wireless and IoT networks. We start with the challenges of resource management in cellular IoT and low-power IoT networks, review the traditional resource management mechanisms for IoT networks, and motivate the use of ML and DL techniques for resource management in these networks. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing ML- and DL-based resource allocation techniques in wireless IoT networks and also techniques specifically designed for HetNets, MIMO and D2D communications, and NOMA networks. To this end, we also identify the future research directions in using ML and DL for resource allocation and management in IoT networks.",

    "abstract": "The development and adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will grow significantly in the coming years to enable Industry 4.0. Many forms of IoT devices will be developed and used across industry verticals. However, the euphoria of this technology adoption is shadowed by the solemn presence of cyber threats that will follow its growth trajectory. Cyber threats would either embed their malicious code or attack vulnerabilities in IoT that could induce significant consequences in cyber and physical realms. In order to manage such destructive effects, incident responders and cyber investigators require the capabilities to find these rogue IoT and contain them quickly. Such online devices may only leave network activity traces. A collection of relevant traces could be used to infer the IoT's network behaviorial fingerprints and in turn could facilitate investigative find of these IoT. However, the challenge is how to infer these fingerprints when there is limited network activity traces. This research proposes the novel model construct that learns to infer the network behaviorial fingerprint of specific IoT based on limited network activity traces using a One-Card Time Series Meta-Learner called DeepNetPrint. Our research also demonstrates the application of DeepNetPrint to identify IoT devices that performs comparatively well against leading supervised learning models. Our solution would enable cyber investigator to identify specific IoT of interest while overcoming the constraints of having only limited network traces of the IoT.",

    "abstract": "The growing use of IoT devices in organizations has increased the number of attack vectors available to attackers due to the less secure nature of the devices. The widely adopted bring your own device (BYOD) policy which allows an employee to bring any IoT device into the workplace and attach it to an organization's network also increases the risk of attacks. In order to address this threat, organizations often implement security policies in which only the connection of white-listed IoT devices is permitted. To monitor adherence to such policies and protect their networks, organizations must be able to identify the IoT devices connected to their networks and, more specifically, to identify connected IoT devices that are not on the white-list (unknown devices). In this study, we applied deep learning on network traffic to automatically identify IoT devices connected to the network. In contrast to previous work, our approach does not require that complex feature engineering be applied on the network traffic, since we represent the communication behavior of IoT devices using small images built from the IoT devices network traffic payloads. In our experiments, we trained a multiclass classifier on a publicly available dataset, successfully identifying 10 different IoT devices and the traffic of smartphones and computers, with over 99% accuracy. We also trained multiclass classifiers to detect unauthorized IoT devices connected to the network, achieving over 99% overall average detection accuracy.",

IoT creates an environment where physical devices and sensors are flawlessly combined into information nodes to deliver innovative and smart services for human-being to make their life easier and more efficient. The main objective of the IoT devices-network is to generate data, which are converted into useful information by the data analysis process, it also provides useful resources to the end users.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) provides applications and services that would otherwise not be possible. However, the open nature of IoT make it vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. Especially, identity spoofing attacks, where an adversary passively listens to existing radio communications and then mimic the identity of legitimate devices to conduct malicious activities. Existing solutions employ cryptographic signatures to verify the trustworthiness of received information. In prevalent IoT, secret keys for cryptography can potentially be disclosed and disable the verification mechanism. Non-cryptographic device verification is needed to ensure trustworthy IoT. In this paper, we propose an enhanced deep learning framework for IoT device identification using physical layer signals. Specifically, we enable our framework to report unseen IoT devices and introduce the zero-bias layer to deep neural networks to increase robustness and interpretability. We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real data from ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), an application of IoT in aviation. The proposed framework has the potential to be applied to accurate identification of IoT devices in a variety of IoT applications and services. Codes and data are available in IEEE Dataport.",

The proxy VM stores and analyzes the IoT data (generated by its IoT devices) in real-time. Moreover, we introduce the semantic and social IoT technology in the context of MEIoT to solve the interoperability and inefficient access control problem in the IoT system.

In the case of single IoT device, we find the optimal closed-form solution by deriving some useful properties based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the solution is no need for numerical iterations.

Therefore, many existing attacks, targeted at traditional computers connected to the Internet, may also be directed at IoT devices. For example, DDoS attacks have become very common in IoT environments, as these environments currently lack basic security monitoring and protection mechanisms, as shown by the recent Mirai and Brickerbot IoT botnets. In this paper, we propose a novel light-weight approach for detecting DDos malware in IoT environments.We firstly extract one-channel gray-scale images converted from binaries, and then utilize a lightweight convolutional neural network for classifying IoT malware families. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve 94.0% accuracy for the classification of goodware and DDoS malware, and 81.8% accuracy for the classification of goodware and two main malware families.",

A distributed game theoretic framework for spectrum leasing is proposed where the licensed users can willingly lease a portion of their spectrum access to unlicensed IoT devices, and in return the IoT devices provide cooperative services, firstly to enhance information secrecy of licensed users via adding intentional jamming to protect them from potential eavesdroppers, and secondly to enhance the quality of communication through cooperative relaying. The cooperative behavior of the potentially selfish IoT devices is monitored using a reputation-based mechanism to enable the primary users to only interact with the reliable IoT devices. The simulation results show that using the proposed reputation-based method enhances the secrecy rate of the primary users by reducing the possibility of attacks from selfish IoT devices. Hence, this model can offer a practical solution for spectrum leasing with mobile IoT devices when assuring the required quality of communication and information secrecy for the spectrum owners.",

    "abstract": "Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is the latest IoT connectivity solution presented by the 3GPP. NB-IoT introduces coverage classes and introduces a significant link budget improvement by allowing repeated transmissions by nodes that experience high path loss. However, those repetitions necessarily increase the energy consumption and the latency in the whole NB-IoT system. The extent to which the whole system is affected depends on the scheduling of the uplink and downlink channels. We address this question, not treated previously, by developing a tractable model of NB-IoT access protocol operation, comprising message exchanges in random-access, control, and data channels, both in the uplink and downlink. The model is then used to analyze the impact of channel scheduling as well as the interaction of coexisting coverage classes, through derivation of the expected latency and battery lifetime for each coverage class. These results are subsequently employed in investigation of latency-energy tradeoff in NB-IoT channel scheduling as well as determining the optimized operation points. Simulations results show validity of the analysis and confirm that there is a significant impact of channel scheduling on latency and lifetime performance of NBIoT devices.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising paradigm to accommodate massive device connections in 5G and beyond. To pave the way for future IoT, the spectrum should be planed in advance. Spectrum sharing is a preferable solution for IoT due to the scarcity of available spectrum resource. In particular, mobile operators are inclined to exploit the existing standards and infrastructures of current cellular networks and deploy IoT within licensed cellular spectrum. Yet, proprietary companies prefer to deploy IoT within unlicensed spectrum to avoid any licence fee. In this paper, we provide a survey on prevalent IoT technologies deployed within licensed cellular spectrum and unlicensed spectrum. Notably, emphasis will be on the spectrum sharing solutions including the shared spectrum, interference model, and interference management. To this end, we discuss both advantages and disadvantages of different IoT technologies. Finally, we identify challenges for future IoT and suggest potential research directions.",

    "abstract": "The increased popularity of IoT devices have made them lucrative targets for attackers. Due to insecure product development practices, these devices are often vulnerable even to very trivial attacks and can be easily compromised. Due to the sheer number and heterogeneity of IoT devices, it is not possible to secure the IoT ecosystem using traditional endpoint and network security solutions. To address the challenges and requirements of securing IoT devices in edge networks, we present IoT-Keeper, which is a novel system capable of securing the network against any malicious activity, in real time. The proposed system uses a lightweight anomaly detection technique, to secure both device-to-device and device-to-infrastructure communications, while using limited resources available on the gateway. It uses unlabeled network data to distinguish between benign and malicious traffic patterns observed in the network. A detailed evaluation, done with real world testbed, shows that IoT-Keeper detects any device generating malicious traffic with high accuracy (0.982) and low false positive rate (0.01). The results demonstrate that IoT-Keeper is lightweight, responsive and can effectively handle complex D2D interactions without requiring explicit attack signatures or sophisticated hardware.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are proliferated in many domains including critical infrastructures such as energy, transportation and manufacturing. Consequently, most of the daily operations now rely on the data coming from wireless sensors or IoT devices and their actions. In addition, personal IoT devices are heavily used for social media applications, which connect people as well as all critical infrastructures to each other under the cyber domain. However, this connectedness also comes with the risk of increasing number of cyber attacks through WSNs and/or IoT. While a significant research has been dedicated to secure WSN/IoT, this still indicates that there needs to be forensics mechanisms to be able to conduct investigations and analysis. In particular, understanding what has happened after a failure is crucial to many businesses, which rely on WSN/IoT applications. Therefore, there is a great interest and need for understanding digital forensics applications in WSN and IoT realms. This chapter fills this gap by providing an overview and classification of digital forensics research and applications in these emerging domains in a comprehensive manner. In addition to analyzing the technical challenges, the chapter provides a survey of the existing efforts from the device level to network level while also pointing out future research opportunities.",

To be specific, the IoT devices can either transmit the sensory data to the base station (BS) directly by cellular communications, or first aggregate the data to a CU through Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications before the CU uploads the aggregated data to the BS. To support massive connections, the IoT devices can leverage the unlicensed spectrum for M2M communications, referred to as IoT Unlicensed (IoT-U). Aiming to maximize the number of scheduled IoT devices and meanwhile associate each IoT devices with the right CU or BS with the minimum transmit power, we first introduce a single-stage formulation that captures these objectives simultaneously. To tackle the NP-hard problem efficiently, we decouple the problem into two subproblems, which are solved by successive linear programming and convex optimization techniques, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed IoT-U scheme can support more IoT devices than that only using the licensed spectrum.",

There are many IoT platforms, each of them capable of providing specific services for such applications. Finding the best match between application and platform is, however, a hard task as it can difficult to understand the implications of small differences between platforms. This paper builds on previous work that has identified twenty-one important factors of an IoT platform, which were verified by Delphi method. We demonstrate here how these factors can be used to discriminate between five well known IoT platforms, which are arbitrarily chosen based on their market share. These results illustrate how the proposed approach provides an objective methodology that can be used to select the most suitable IoT platform for different business applications based on their particular requirements.",

Such an approach often stumbles upon the reluctance of IoT system owners to loose the dominion over data. We introduce a secured and privacy-safe infrastructure where a federation overlay is distributed among parties and the data control is kept locally. This establishes a league of peers each sovereign of their IoT system and data: League of IoT Sovereignties (LIoTS). LIoTS is scalable by design, allowing iterative formation of domains levels due to the transparency of its federation. Tests show that the overhead is minimal when exchanged data is hefty, and that LIoTS performs better in large IoT deployments than centralized approaches.",

To shed light on this convergence of MLSys and IoT, this paper analyzes the trade-offs by covering the latest developments (up to 2020) on scaling and distributing ML across cloud, edge, and IoT devices. We position machine learning systems as a component of the IoT, and edge intelligence as a socio-technical system.

A lot of consumer IoT devices have little to no security implementation at all, thus risking user's privacy and making them target of mass cyber-attacks. Indeed, recent outbreak of Mirai botnet and its variants have already proved the lack of security on the IoT world. Hence, it is important to understand the security issues and attack vectors in the IoT domain. Though significant research has been done to secure traditional computing systems, little focus was given to the IoT realm.

Specifically, we introduce U-PoT: a novel honeypot framework for capturing attacks on IoT devices that use Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol. A myriad of smart home devices including smart switches, smart bulbs, surveillance cameras, smart hubs, etc. uses the UPnP protocol. Indeed, a simple search on Shodan IoT search engine lists 1,676,591 UPnP devices that are exposed to public network. The popularity and ubiquitous nature of UPnP-based IoT device necessitates a full-fledged IoT honeypot system for UPnP devices. Our novel framework automatically creates a honeypot from UPnP device description documents and is extendable to any device types or vendors that use UPnP for communication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work towards a flexible and configurable honeypot framework for UPnP-based IoT devices. We released U-PoT under an open source license for further research and created a database of UPnP device descriptions. We also evaluated our framework on two emulated deices. Our experiments show that the emulated devices are able to mimic the behavior of a real IoT device and trick vendor-provided device management applications or popular IoT search engines while having minimal performance ovherhead.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies an edge intelligence-based IoT network in which a set of edge servers learn a shared model using federated learning (FL) based on the datasets uploaded from a multi-technology-supported IoT network. The data uploading performance of IoT network and the computational capacity of edge servers are entangled with each other in influencing the FL model training process. We propose a novel framework, called federated edge intelligence (FEI), that allows edge servers to evaluate the required number of data samples according to the energy cost of the IoT network as well as their local data processing capacity and only request the amount of data that is sufficient for training a satisfactory model. We evaluate the energy cost for data uploading when two widely-used IoT solutions: licensed band IoT (e.g., 5G NB-IoT) and unlicensed band IoT (e.g., Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and 5G NR-U) are available to each IoT device. We prove that the cost minimization problem of the entire IoT network is separable and can be divided into a set of subproblems, each of which can be solved by an individual edge server. We also introduce a mapping function to quantify the computational load of edge servers under different combinations of three key parameters: size of the dataset, local batch size, and number of local training passes. Finally, we adopt an Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based approach to jointly optimize energy cost of the IoT network and average computing resource utilization of edge servers. We prove that our proposed algorithm does not cause any data leakage nor disclose any topological information of the IoT network. Simulation results show that our proposed framework significantly improves the resource efficiency of the IoT network and edge servers with only a limited sacrifice on the model convergence performance.",

Manufacturing systems and more specifically assembly systems (ASs) should allow quick adaptation of manufacturing assets so as to respond to the evolving market requirements that lead to mass customization. Meanwhile, the manufacturing era is changing due to the fourth industrial revolution, i.e., Industry 4.0, that will change the traditional manufacturing environment to an IoT-based one. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of cyber-physical microservice in the Manufacturing and the ASs domain and presents the Cyber-Physical microservice and IoT-based (CPuS-IoT) framework. The CPuS-IoT framework exploits the benefits of the microservice architectural style and the IoT technologies, but also utilizes the existing in this domain huge investment based on traditional technologies, to support the life cycle of evolvable ASs in the age of Industry 4.0. It provides a solid basis to capture domain knowledge that is used by a model-driven engineering (MDE) approach to semi-automate the development, evolution and operation of ASs, as well as, to establish a common vocabulary for assembly system experts and IoT ones. The CPuS-IoT approach and framework effectively combines MDE with IoT and the microservice architectural paradigm. A case study for the assembly of an everyday life product is adopted to demonstrate the approach even to non-experts of this domain.",

As IoT, 5G and AI continue to converge to realize the promise of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), security incidents and events on IoT networks have increased. Deep learning techniques are being applied to detect and mitigate many of such security threats against IoT networks. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) have been widely used for classifying intrusion attacks in IoT networks. In this paper, we consider a variant of the FNN known as the Self-normalizing Neural Network (SNN) and compare its performance with the FNN for classifying intrusion attacks in an IoT network. Our analysis is performed using the BoT-IoT dataset from the Cyber Range Lab of the center of UNSW Canberra Cyber. In our experimental results, the FNN outperforms the SNN for intrusion detection in IoT networks based on multiple performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall as well as multi-classification metrics such as Cohen's Kappa score. However, when tested for adversarial robustness, the SNN demonstrates better resilience against the adversarial samples from the IoT dataset, presenting a promising future in the quest for safer and more secure deep learning in IoT networks.",

    "abstract": "As the Internet of Things (IoT) emerges over the next decade, developing secure communication for IoT devices is of paramount importance. Achieving end-to-end encryption for large-scale IoT systems, like smart buildings or smart cities, is challenging because multiple principals typically interact indirectly via intermediaries, meaning that the recipient of a message is not known in advance. This paper proposes JEDI (Joining Encryption and Delegation for IoT), a many-to-many end-to-end encryption protocol for IoT. JEDI encrypts and signs messages end-to-end, while conforming to the decoupled communication model typical of IoT systems. JEDI's keys support expiry and fine-grained access to data, common in IoT. Furthermore, JEDI allows principals to delegate their keys, restricted in expiry or scope, to other principals, thereby granting access to data and managing access control in a scalable, distributed way. Through careful protocol design and implementation, JEDI can run across the spectrum of IoT devices, including ultra low-power deeply embedded sensors severely constrained in CPU, memory, and energy consumption. We apply JEDI to an existing IoT messaging system and demonstrate that its overhead is modest.",

In this paper, we present an initial study targeting an unexplored sphere in IoT by illuminating the potential of crowdsource ethical hacking approaches for enhancing IoT vulnerability management. We focus on Bug Bounty Programs (BBP) and Responsible Disclosure (RD), which stimulate hackers to report vulnerability in exchange for monetary rewards. We carried out a qualitative investigation supported by literature survey and expert interviews to explore how BBP and RD can facilitate the practice of identifying, classifying, prioritizing, remediating, and mitigating IoT vulnerabilities in an effective and cost-efficient manner. Besides deriving tangible guidelines for IoT stakeholders, our study also sheds light on a systematic integration path to combine BBP and RD with existing security practices (e.g., penetration test) to further boost overall IoT security.",

The platform supports modelling heterogeneous IoT nodes (sensors, actuators, gateways, etc.) with their fine-grained details (mobility, energy profile, etc.), as well as different models of application logic and network connectivity.

We characterize smart home IoT traffic in terms of its volume, temporal patterns, and external endpoints along with focusing on certain security and privacy concerns. We first show that traffic characteristics reflect the functionality of smart home IoT devices such as smart TVs generating high volume traffic to content streaming services following diurnal patterns associated with human activity. While the smart home IoT ecosystem seems fragmented, our analysis reveals that it is mostly centralized due to its reliance on a few popular cloud and DNS services. Our findings also highlight several interesting security and privacy concerns in smart home IoT ecosystem such as the need to improve policy-based access control for IoT traffic, lack of use of application layer encryption, and prevalence of third-party advertising and tracking services. Our findings have important implications for future research on improving management, security, and privacy of the smart home IoT ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "The challenge of wildfire management and detection is recently gaining increased attention due to the increased severity and frequency of wildfires worldwide. Popular fire detection techniques such as satellite imaging and remote camera-based sensing suffer from late detection and low reliability while early wildfire detection is a key to prevent massive fires. In this paper, we propose a novel wildfire detection solution based on unmanned aerial vehicles assisted Internet of things (UAV-IoT) networks. The main objective is to (1) study the performance and reliability of the UAV-IoT networks for wildfire detection and (2) present a guideline to optimize the UAV-IoT network to improve fire detection probability under limited budgets. We focus on optimizing the IoT devices' density and number of UAVs covering the forest area such that a lower bound of the wildfires detection probability is maximized within a limited time and budget. At any time after the fire ignition, the IoT devices within a limited distance from the fire can detect it. These IoT devices can then report their measurements only when the UAV is nearby. Discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) analysis is utilized to compute the fire detection probability at discrete time. Before declaring fire detection, a validation state is designed to account for IoT devices' practical limitations such as miss-detection and false alarm probabilities. Numerical results suggest that given enough system budget, the UAV-IoT based fire detection can offer a faster and more reliable wildfire detection solution than the state of the art satellite imaging techniques.",

This contribution derives and presents the information technology-related fundament and basis required to be able to reap this potential. Quantity and heterogeneity of the devices and machines especially encountered in the industry at large in the so-called industrial IoT (IIoT) require the use of a typically cloud-based IoT platform for logical concentration and more efficient management of the -- unavoidable in industry -- complexity. Stringent non-functional requirements especially regarding (low) latency, (high) bandwidth, access to large processing capacities, and security and privacy-related aspects necessitate the deployment of intermediary IoT gateways endowed with different capability sets in the edge continuum between IoT endpoints and the IoT platform in the cloud. This will be illustrated in the form of two use cases from corporate projects using a component architecture view point. Finally we argue that this classical concept of IoT projects needs to be strategically widened towards application integration (key word: IT/OT integration) and API management resulting in the coupling of a suitable integration and API management platforms to the IoT platform in order to use this end-to-end understanding of IoT/IIoT to fully leverage the innovation-stimulating and transformational character of IIoT and Industry 4.0.",

This data sharing raises privacy concerns especially since in most cases the data are gathered and shared without the user's knowledge or explicit consent or for different purposes than the one for which the data were initially gathered. With the introduction of GDPR, IoT systems and experimentation platforms that federate data from different deployments, testbeds and data providers must be privacy-preserving. The wide adoption of IoT applications in scenarios ranging from smart cities to Industry 4.0 has raised concerns with respect to the privacy of users' data collected using IoT devices. Many experimental smart city applications are also using crowdsourcing data. Inspired by the GDPR requirements, we propose an IoT ontology built using available standards that enhances privacy, enables semantic interoperability between IoT deployments and supports the development of privacy-preserving experimental IoT applications. On top, we propose recommendations on how to efficiently use the ontology within IoT testbed and federating platforms. Our ontology is validated for different quality assessment criteria using standard validation tools. We focus on \"experimentation\" without loss of generality, because it covers scenarios from both research and industry, that are directly linked with innovation.",

    "abstract": "The increased reliance on the Internet and the corresponding surge in connectivity demand has led to a significant growth in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The continued deployment of IoT devices has in turn led to an increase in network attacks due to the larger number of potential attack surfaces as illustrated by the recent reports that IoT malware attacks increased by 215.7% from 10.3 million in 2017 to 32.7 million in 2018. This illustrates the increased vulnerability and susceptibility of IoT devices and networks. Therefore, there is a need for proper effective and efficient attack detection and mitigation techniques in such environments. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as one potential solution due to the abundance of data generated and available for IoT devices and networks. Hence, they have significant potential to be adopted for intrusion detection for IoT environments. To that end, this paper proposes an optimized ML-based framework consisting of a combination of Bayesian optimization Gaussian Process (BO-GP) algorithm and decision tree (DT) classification model to detect attacks on IoT devices in an effective and efficient manner. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using the Bot-IoT-2018 dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed optimized framework has a high detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for the detection of botnet attacks in IoT environments.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the boom of the consumer IoT market, many device manufacturers, start-up companies and technology giants have jumped into the space. Unfortunately, the exciting utility and rapid marketization of IoT, come at the expense of privacy and security. Industry reports and academic work have revealed many attacks on IoT systems, resulting in privacy leakage, property loss and large-scale availability problems. To mitigate such threats, a few solutions have been proposed. However, it is still less clear what are the impacts they can have on the IoT ecosystem. In this work, we aim to perform a comprehensive study on reported attacks and defenses in the realm of IoT aiming to find out what we know, where the current studies fall short and how to move forward. To this end, we first build a toolkit that searches through massive amount of online data using semantic analysis to identify over 3000 IoT-related articles. Further, by clustering such collected data using machine learning technologies, we are able to compare academic views with the findings from industry and other sources, in an attempt to understand the gaps between them, the trend of the IoT security risks and new problems that need further attention. We systemize this process, by proposing a taxonomy for the IoT ecosystem and organizing IoT security into five problem areas. We use this taxonomy as a beacon to assess each IoT work across a number of properties we define. Our assessment reveals that relevant security and privacy problems are far from solved. We discuss how each proposed solution can be applied to a problem area and highlight their strengths, assumptions and constraints. We stress the need for a security framework for IoT vendors and discuss the trend of shifting security liability to external or centralized entities. We also identify open research problems and provide suggestions towards a secure IoT ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "IoT devices are increasingly deployed in daily life. Many of these devices are, however, vulnerable due to insecure design, implementation, and configuration. As a result, many networks already have vulnerable IoT devices that are easy to compromise. This has led to a new category of malware specifically targeting IoT devices. However, existing intrusion detection techniques are not effective in detecting compromised IoT devices given the massive scale of the problem in terms of the number of different types of devices and manufacturers involved. In this paper, we present D\\\"IoT, an autonomous self-learning distributed system for detecting compromised IoT devices effectively. In contrast to prior work, D\\\"IoT uses a novel self-learning approach to classify devices into device types and build normal communication profiles for each of these that can subsequently be used to detect anomalous deviations in communication patterns. D\\\"IoT utilizes a federated learning approach for aggregating behavior profiles efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first system to employ a federated learning approach to anomaly-detection-based intrusion detection. Consequently, D\\\"IoT can cope with emerging new and unknown attacks. We systematically and extensively evaluated more than 30 off-the-shelf IoT devices over a long term and show that D\\\"IoT is highly effective (95.6% detection rate) and fast (~257 ms) at detecting devices compromised by, for instance, the infamous Mirai malware. D\\\"IoT reported no false alarms when evaluated in a real-world smart home deployment setting.",

    "abstract": "As a massive number of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are deployed, the security and privacy issues in IoT arouse more and more attention. The IoT attacks are causing tremendous loss to the IoT networks and even threatening human safety. Compared to traditional networks, IoT networks have unique characteristics, which make the attack detection more challenging. First, the heterogeneity of platforms, protocols, software, and hardware exposes various vulnerabilities. Second, in addition to the traditional high-rate attacks, the low-rate attacks are also extensively used by IoT attackers to obfuscate the legitimate and malicious traffic. These low-rate attacks are challenging to detect and can persist in the networks. Last, the attackers are evolving to be more intelligent and can dynamically change their attack strategies based on the environment feedback to avoid being detected, making it more challenging for the defender to discover a consistent pattern to identify the attack. In order to adapt to the new characteristics in IoT attacks, we propose a reinforcement learning-based attack detection model that can automatically learn and recognize the transformation of the attack pattern. Therefore, we can continuously detect IoT attacks with less human intervention. In this paper, we explore the crucial features of IoT traffics and utilize the entropy-based metrics to detect both the high-rate and low-rate IoT attacks. Afterward, we leverage the reinforcement learning technique to continuously adjust the attack detection threshold based on the detection feedback, which optimizes the detection and the false alarm rate. We conduct extensive experiments over a real IoT attack dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of our IoT attack detection framework.",

Research into IoT was fueled by research in wireless sensor networks, but rather than start from a device perspective, this article looks at how architectures deal with interacting entities at large scale. The domain of MMOWs is examined for properties that are affected by scale. Thereafter the domain of IoT is evaluated to see if each of those properties are found and how each is handled. By comparing the current state of the art of MMOWs and IoT, with respect to scalability, the problem of scaling IoT is explicated, as well as the problem of incorporating an MMOW with IoT into a pervasive platform.

In this paper, we propose a knowledge driven approach called Context Aware Sensor Configuration Model (CASCOM) to simplify the process of configuring IoT middleware platforms, so the data consumers, specifically non-technical personnel, can easily retrieve the data they required. In this paper, we demonstrate how IoT resources can be described using semantics in such away that they can later be used to compose service work-flows.

First, given a fixed ground IoT network, the total transmit power of the devices is minimized by properly clustering the IoT devices with each cluster being served by one UAV. Next, to maintain energy-efficient communications in time-varying mobile IoT networks, the optimal trajectories of the UAVs are determined by exploiting the framework of optimal transport theory. Simulation results show that by using the proposed approach, the total transmit power of IoT devices for reliable uplink communications can be reduced by 56% compared to the fixed Voronoi deployment method.

In this paper, a novel anti-jamming strategy for OFDM-based IoT systems is proposed which enables an IoT controller to protect the IoT devices against a malicious radio jammer. The interaction between the controller node and the jammer is modeled as a Colonel Blotto game with continuous and asymmetric resources in which the IoT controller, acting as defender, seeks to thwart the jamming attack by distributing its power among the subcarries in a smart way to decrease the aggregate bit error rate (BER) caused by the jammer. The jammer, on the other hand, aims at disrupting the system performance by allocating jamming power to different frequency bands. To solve the game, an evolutionary algorithm is proposed which can find a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of the Blotto game. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm enables the IoT controller to maintain the BER above an acceptable threshold, thereby preserving the IoT network performance in the presence of malicious jamming.",

Scientific contributions to the SWoT are many, and the diversity of architectures in which they are expressed complicates comparison. To unify the presented architectures, we propose an architectural pattern, LMU-N. LMU-N provides a reading grid used to classify processes to which the SWoT community contributes, and to describe how the semantic web impacts the IoT.

Securing networks where the presence of such vulnerable devices is given, requires a brownfield approach: applying necessary protection measures within the network so that potentially vulnerable devices can coexist without endangering the security of other devices in the same network. In this paper, we present IOT SENTINEL, a system capable of automatically identifying the types of devices being connected to an IoT network and enabling enforcement of rules for constraining the communications of vulnerable devices so as to minimize damage resulting from their compromise.

Though NDN-based IoT frameworks have been proposed, none have adequately and holistically addressed concerns related to secure onboarding and routing. Additionally, emerging IoT applications such as smart cities require high scalability and thus pose new challenges to NDN routing. Therefore, in this work, we propose and evaluate a novel, scalable framework for lightweight authentication and hierarchical routing in the NDN IoT (ND- NoT). Our ns-3 based simulation analyses demonstrate that our framework is scalable and efficient. It supports deployment densities as high as 40,000 nodes/km2 with an average onboarding convergence time of around 250 seconds and overhead of less than 20 KiB per node. This demonstrates its efficacy for emerging large-scale IoT applications such as smart cities.",

    "abstract": "Service virtualization is an approach that uses virtualized environments to automatically test enterprise services in production-like conditions. Many techniques have been proposed to provide such a realistic environment for enterprise services. The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is an emerging field which connects a diverse set of devices over different transport layers, using a variety of protocols. Provisioning a virtual testbed of IoT devices can accelerate IoT application development by enabling automated testing without requiring a continuous connection to the physical devices. One solution is to expand existing enterprise service virtualization to IoT environments. There are various structural differences between the two environments that should be considered to implement appropriate service virtualization for IoT. This paper examines the structural differences between various IoT protocols and enterprise protocols and identifies key technical challenges that need to be addressed to implement service virtualization in IoT environments.",

    "abstract": "The increasing popularity of specialized Internet-connected devices and appliances, dubbed the Internet-of-Things (IoT), promises both new conveniences and new privacy concerns. Unlike traditional web browsers, many IoT devices have always-on sensors that constantly monitor fine-grained details of users' physical environments and influence the devices' network communications. Passive network observers, such as Internet service providers, could potentially analyze IoT network traffic to infer sensitive details about users. Here, we examine four IoT smart home devices (a Sense sleep monitor, a Nest Cam Indoor security camera, a WeMo switch, and an Amazon Echo) and find that their network traffic rates can reveal potentially sensitive user interactions even when the traffic is encrypted. These results indicate that a technological solution is needed to protect IoT device owner privacy, and that IoT-specific concerns must be considered in the ongoing policy debate around ISP data collection and usage.",

In this paper, we present a blockchain-based design for the IoT that brings a distributed access control and data management. We depart from the current trust model that delegates access control of our data to a centralized trusted authority and instead empower the users with data ownership. Our design is tailored for IoT data streams and enables secure data sharing. We enable a secure and resilient access control management, by utilizing the blockchain as an auditable and distributed access control layer to the storage layer. We facilitate the storage of time-series IoT data at the edge of the network via a locality-aware decentralized storage system that is managed with the blockchain technology. Our system is agnostic of the physical storage nodes and supports as well utilization of cloud storage resources as storage nodes.",

This paper discusses a case study on search and rescue IoT applications in large-scale disaster scenarios. It proposes an IoT IaaS architecture that virtualizes robots (IaaS for robots) and provides them to the upstream applications as-a-Service. Node- and Network-level robots virtualization are supported. The proposed architecture meets a set of identified requirements, such as the need for a unified description model for heterogeneous robots, publication/discovery mechanism, and federation with other IaaS for robots when needed. A validating proof of concept is built and experiments are made to evaluate its performance. Lessons learned and prospective research directions are discussed.",

The ever-shrinking size of unit computation (Moore's Law) and continued improvements in efficient communication (Shannon's Law) is expected to harness the true potential of the IoT revolution and produce dramatic societal impact. However, reducing size of IoT nodes and lack of significant improvement in energy-storage density leads to reducing energy-availability. Moreover, smaller size and energy means less resources available for securing IoT nodes, making the energy-sparse low-cost leaf nodes of the network as prime targets for attackers.

While legacy wide-area wireless systems are highly dependent on network-side coordination, the level of consumed energy in signaling, as well as the expected increase in the number of IoT devices, makes such centralized approaches infeasible in future. Here, we address this problem by self-coordination for IoT networks through learning from past communications. To this end, we first study low-complexity distributed learning approaches applicable in IoT communications. Then, we present a learning solution to adapt communication parameters of devices to the environment for maximizing energy efficiency and reliability in data transmissions. Furthermore, leveraging tools from stochastic geometry, we evaluate the performance of proposed distributed learning solution against the centralized coordination. Finally, we analyze the interplay amongst energy efficiency, reliability of communications against noise and interference over data channel, and reliability against adversarial interference over data and feedback channels. The simulation results indicate that compared to the state of the art approaches, both energy efficiency and reliability in IoT communications could be significantly improved using the proposed learning approach. These promising results, which are achieved using lightweight learning, make our solution favorable in many low-cost low-power IoT applications.",

To advance research in this direction, we mined the social media platform Twitter to learn about public opinion about the IoT.

It is also important to determine if there is a requirement to develop new lightweight cryptographic ciphers for these devices.

Consequently, decentralized IoT has been proposed by taking advantage of the emerging technology of Blockchain. Voting systems are widely adopted in IoT, such as a leader election in wireless sensor networks. Self-tallying voting systems are alternatives to traditional centralized voting systems in decentralized IoT since the traditional ones are not suitable for such scenarios. Unfortunately, self-tallying voting systems inherently suffer from fairness issues, such as adaptive and abortive issues caused by malicious voters. In this paper, we introduce a framework of self-tallying systems in decentralized IoT based on Blockchain. We propose a concrete construction and prove the proposed system satisfies all the security requirements including fairness, dispute-freeness and maximal ballot secrecy.

In this paper, we propose different classifiers that identify a device as IoT or non-IoT, in a short time scale, and with high accuracy. Our classifiers were constructed using machine learning techniques on a seen (training) dataset and were tested on an unseen (test) dataset. They successfully classified devices that were not in the seen dataset with accuracy above 95%. The first classifier is a logistic regression classifier based on traffic features. The second classifier is based on features we retrieve from DHCP packets. Finally, we present a unified classifier that leverages the advantages of the other two classifiers.

In this paper, a novel, lightweight, and distributive detection scheme based on edge computing is proposed for detecting Sybil attacks in mobile IoT. In the proposed scheme, a detection consists of two rounds. In each round, member nodes are required to send packets to edge nodes. Edge nodes calculate a possible interval of the received signal strength indication (RSSI) from the first round and check whether the RSSI from the second round is in the interval to detect Sybil attack. Extensive experimental studies are included to show that the presented approach outperforms many existing approaches in terms of true detection and false detection rates. Moreover, experimental results show that the fault tolerance design in the proposed approach greatly enhances the detection scheme.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of IoT devices in smart homes, hospitals, and enterprise networks is widespread and continuing to increase in a superlinear manner. With this unprecedented growth, how can one assess the security of an IoT network holistically? In this article, we explore two dimensions of security assessment, using vulnerability information of IoT devices and their underlying components ($\\textit{compositional security scores}$) and SIEM logs captured from the communications and operations of such devices in a network ($\\textit{dynamic activity metrics}$) to propose the notion of an $\\textit{attack circuit}$. These measures are used to evaluate the security of IoT devices and the overall IoT network, demonstrating the effectiveness of attack circuits as practical tools for computing security metrics (exploitability, impact, and risk to confidentiality, integrity, and availability) of heterogeneous networks. We propose methods for generating attack circuits with input/output pairs constructed from CVEs using natural language processing (NLP) and with weights computed using standard security scoring procedures, as well as efficient optimization methods for evaluating attack circuits. Our system provides insight into possible attack paths an adversary may utilize based on their exploitability, impact, or overall risk. We have performed experiments on IoT networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques.",

However, IoT deployments with a large number of devices, such as in environment monitoring applications, generate and send massive amounts of data. This would generate vast number of transactions that must be processed within the distributed ledger. In this work, we first demonstrate that the Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain fails to scale in a sizable IoT connectivity infrastructure. To solve this problem, we present a lightweight distributed ledger scheme to integrate PoW blockchain into IoT. In our scheme, we classify transactions into two types: 1) global transactions, which must be processed by global blockchain nodes and 2) local transactions, which can be processed locally by entities called witnesses. Performance evaluation demonstrates that our proposed scheme improves the scalability of integrated blockchain and IoT monitoring systems by processing a fraction of the transactions, inversely proportional to the number of witnesses, locally. Hence, reducing the number of global transactions.",

Since the volume of video data is far greater than traditional data in IoT, it is challenging to ensure high Quality of Service (QoS) for video uplinking in IoT. To address this challenge, we integrate non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and scalable video coding (SVC) in IoT. To improve the video quality, we formulate a power allocation problem to maximize the average QoS in the proposed integrated system. Due to that the problem is non-convex, we transform it into a monotonic problem based on its hidden monotonicity. Then a power allocation algorithm based on polyblock outer approximation is proposed to solve the problem effectively. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing OMA and NOMA based schemes for video uplinking in IoT in terms of QoS and energy efficiency.",

In embedded application such as microcontroller SoC of Internet of Things (IoT), embedded Flash (eFlash) is widely employed. However, eFlash is also associated with cost. Therefore, replacing eFlash with STTRAM is desirable in IoTs for power-efficiency. Although promising, STTRAM brings several new security and privacy challenges that pose a significant threat to sensitive data in memory. This is inevitable due to the underlying dependency of this memory technology on environmental parameters such as temperature and magnetic fields that can be exploited by an adversary to tamper with the program and data. In this paper, we investigate these attacks and propose a novel memory architecture for attack resilient IoT network. The information redundancy present in a homogeneous peer-to-peer connected IoT network is exploited to restore the corrupted memory of any IoT node when under attack. We are able to build a failsafe IoT system with STTRAM based program memory which allows guaranteed execution of all the IoT nodes without complete shutdown of any node under attack. Experimental results using commercial IoT boards demonstrate the latency and energy overhead of the attack recovery process.",

However, cellular networks may have scalability problems to provide uplink connectivity to massive numbers of connected things. To characterize the scalability of cellular uplink in the context of IoT networks, this paper develops a traffic-aware spatiotemporal mathematical model for IoT devices supported by cellular uplink connectivity. The developed model is based on stochastic geometry and queueing theory to account for the traffic requirement per IoT device, the different transmission strategies, and the mutual interference between the IoT devices. To this end, the developed model is utilized to characterize the extent to which cellular networks can accommodate IoT traffic as well as to assess and compare three different transmission strategies that incorporate a combination of transmission persistency, backoff, and power-ramping. The analysis and the results clearly illustrate the scalability problem imposed by IoT on cellular network and offer insights into effective scenarios for each transmission strategy.",

Conventional security and authentication solutions often fail to meet IoT security requirements due to the computationally limited and portable nature of IoT objects. In this paper, an IoT objects authentication framework is proposed. The framework uses device-specific information, called fingerprints, along with a transfer learning tool to authenticate objects in the IoT. The framework tracks the effect of changes in the physical environment on fingerprints and uses unique IoT environmental effects features to detect both cyber and cyber-physical emulation attacks. The proposed environmental effects estimation framework is proven to improve the detection rate of attackers without increasing the false positives rate. The proposed framework is also shown to be able to detect cyber-physical attackers that are capable of replicating the fingerprints of target objects which conventional methods are unable to detect. A transfer learning approach is proposed to allow the use of objects with different types and features in the environmental effects estimation process to enhance the performance of the framework while capturing practical IoT deployments with diverse object types. Simulation results using real IoT device data show that the proposed approach can yield a 40% improvement in cyber emulation attacks detection and is able to detect cyber-physical emulation attacks that conventional methods cannot detect. The results also show that the proposed framework improves the authentication accuracy while the transfer learning approach yields up to 70% additional performance gains.",

Each IoT device is assumed to be equipped with Power Splitting (PS) hardware that enables Energy Harvesting (EH) and imposes an individual Quality of Service (QoS) constraint to the downlink communication.

    "abstract": "The DDoS attack is a serious threat to the Internet of Things (IoT). As a new class of DDoS attacks, Link-flooding attack (LFA) disrupts connectivity between legitimate IoT devices and target servers by flooding only a small number of links. Several mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate the sophisticated attack. However, they can only reactively mitigate LFA after target links have been flooded by the adversaries. In this paper, we propose an active LFA mitigation mechanism, called Linkbait, that is a proactive and preventive defense to throttle LFA for IoT. The fact behind Linkbait is that adversaries rely on the set of key links impacting the network connectivity (i.e.,linkmap) to identify target links. Linkbait mitigates the attacks by interfering with linkmap discovery and providing a fake linkmap to adversaries. Inspired by moving target defense (MTD), we propose a link obfuscation algorithm in Linkbait that selectively reroutes probing flows to hide target links from adversaries and mislead them to identify bait links as target links. By providing the faked linkmap to adversaries, Linkbait can actively mitigate LFA for IoT even without identifying compromised IoT devices while not affecting flows from legitimate IoT devices. To block attack traffic and further reduce the impact in IoT, we propose a compromised IoT devices detection algorithm that extracts unique traffic patterns of LFA for IoT and leverages support vector machine (SVM) to identify attack traffic. We evaluate the performance of Linkbait by using both real-world experiments and large-scale simulations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Linkbait.",

The connectivity of IoTs plays an important role in information dissemination for mission-critical and civilian applications.

In this work, we develop a heterogeneous IoT network design framework in which a network designer can add links to provide additional communication paths between two nodes or secure links against attacks by investing resources. By anticipating the strategic cyber attacks, we characterize the optimal design of secure IoT network by first providing a lower bound on the number of links a secure network requires for a given budget of protected links, and then developing a method to construct networks that satisfy the heterogeneous network design specifications. Therefore, each layer of the designed heterogeneous IoT network is resistant to a predefined level of malicious attacks with minimum resources.

IoT aims to connect anyone and/or anything at any time by any path on any place. From last decade, IoTs attracts both industry and research communities. IoTs is an emerging research field and still in its infancy. Thus, this paper presents the potential of ICN for IoTs by providing state-of-the-art literature survey. We discuss briefly the feasibility of ICN features and their models (and architectures) in the context of IoT. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive survey on ICN based caching, naming, security and mobility approaches for IoTs with appropriate classification. Furthermore, we present operating systems (OS) and simulation tools for ICNIoT. Finally, we provide important research challenges and issues faced by ICN for IoTs.",

    "abstract": "Securing the Internet of Things (IoT) is a necessary milestone toward expediting the deployment of its applications and services. In particular, the functionality of the IoT devices is extremely dependent on the reliability of their message transmission. Cyber attacks such as data injection, eavesdropping, and man-in-the-middle threats can lead to security challenges. Securing IoT devices against such attacks requires accounting for their stringent computational power and need for low-latency operations. In this paper, a novel deep learning method is proposed for dynamic watermarking of IoT signals to detect cyber attacks. The proposed learning framework, based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure, enables the IoT devices to extract a set of stochastic features from their generated signal and dynamically watermark these features into the signal. This method enables the IoT's cloud center, which collects signals from the IoT devices, to effectively authenticate the reliability of the signals. Furthermore, the proposed method prevents complicated attack scenarios such as eavesdropping in which the cyber attacker collects the data from the IoT devices and aims to break the watermarking algorithm. Simulation results show that, with an attack detection delay of under 1 second the messages can be transmitted from IoT devices with an almost 100% reliability.",

    "abstract": "From its early days the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved into a decentralized system of cooperating smart objects with the requirement, among others, of achieving distributed consensus. Yet, current IoT platform solutions are centralized cloud based computing infrastructures, manifesting a number of significant disadvantages, such as, among others, high cloud server maintenance costs, weakness for supporting time-critical IoT applications, security and trust issues. Enabling blockchain technology into IoT can help to achieve a proper distributed consensus based IoT system that overcomes those disadvantages. While this is an ideal match, it is still a challenging endeavor. In this paper we take a first step towards that goal by designing Hybrid-IoT, a hybrid blockchain architecture for IoT. In Hybrid-IoT, subgroups of IoT devices form PoW blockchains, referred to as PoW sub-blockchains. Then, the connection among the PoW sub-blockchains employs a BFT inter-connector framework, such as Polkadot or Cosmos. In this paper we focus on the PoW sub-blockchains formation, guided by a set of guidelines based on a set of dimensions, metrics and bounds. In order to prove the validity of the approach we carry a performance and security evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of Internet of Things (IoTs) allows heterogeneous embedded smart devices to collaboratively provide smart services with or without human intervention. While leveraging the large scale IoT based applications like Smart Gird or Smart Cities, IoTs also incur more concerns on privacy and security. Among the top security challenges that IoTs face, access authorization is critical in resource sharing and information protection. One of the weaknesses in today's access control (AC) is the centralized authorization server, which can be the performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. In this paper, BlendCAC, a blockchain enabled decentralized capability based AC is proposed for the security of IoTs. The BlendCAC aims at an effective access control processes to devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems. Based on the blockchain network, a capability delegation mechanism is suggested for access permission propagation. A robust identity based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of smart contract for registering, propagation and revocation of the access authorization. In the proposed BlendCAC scheme, IoT devices are their own master to control their resources instead of being supervised by a centralized authority. Implemented and tested on a Raspberry Pi device and on a local private blockchain network, our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed BlendCAC approach to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine grained AC solution to IoT systems.",

Indeed, data aggregators can complement cellular base stations and process IoT traffic to reduce network congestion. In this paper, we consider using mobile data aggregators, e.g., drones, that collect IoT traffic and aggregate them to the network. Specifically, we first discuss how the spectrum can be shared between cellular users (UEs) and IoT devices in the presence of drones, proposing a time-division duplexing protocol. We use stochastic geometry to analyze this protocol, comparing it to the standard spectrum sharing and orthogonal allocation protocols. We then formulate a stochastic optimization problem to optimize the nominal IoT transmit power, maximizing the average energy-efficiency (EE) of the IoT device subject to interference constraints to protect UEs. Simulations are presented to validate the theoretical insights and the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. It is shown that using drones, to aggregate IoT traffic, improves the EE of IoT devices, yet the EE degrades as their altitudes increases. Equally important, optimizing the transmit power is critical to further improve the EE, while ensuring fair coexistence with UEs.",

Furthermore it shifts traditionally centralized Cloud architectures towards a more distributed and decentralized computation paradigm, as required by IoT technologies, bridging the gap between Cloud Computing and IoT ecosystems. Thus, Cloud4IoT is playing a role similar to the one covered by solutions like Fog Computing, Cloudlets or Mobile Edge Cloud. The hierarchical architecture of Cloud4IoThosts a central Cloud platform and multiple remote edge Cloud modules supporting dedicated devices, namely the IoT Gateways, through which new sensor objects are made accessible to the platform. Overall, the platform is designed in order to support systems where IoT-based and data intensive applications may pose specific requirements for low latency, restricted available bandwidth, or data locality.

In order to reduce this risk, the IETF is pushing IoT vendors to develop formal specifications of the intended purpose of their IoT devices, in the form of a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD), so that their network behavior in any operating environment can be locked down and verified rigorously. This paper aims to assist IoT manufacturers in developing and verifying MUD profiles, while also helping adopters of these devices to ensure they are compatible with their organizational policies and track devices network behavior based on their MUD profile. Our first contribution is to develop a tool that takes the traffic trace of an arbitrary IoT device as input and automatically generates the MUD profile for it. We contribute our tool as open source, apply it to 28 consumer IoT devices, and highlight insights and challenges encountered in the process. Our second contribution is to apply a formal semantic framework that not only validates a given MUD profile for consistency, but also checks its compatibility with a given organizational policy. We apply our framework to representative organizations and selected devices, to demonstrate how MUD can reduce the effort needed for IoT acceptance testing. Finally, we show how operators can dynamically identify IoT devices using known MUD profiles and monitor their behavioral changes on their network.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) will be a main data generation infrastructure for achieving better system intelligence. This paper considers the design and implementation of a practical privacy-preserving collaborative learning scheme, in which a curious learning coordinator trains a better machine learning model based on the data samples contributed by a number of IoT objects, while the confidentiality of the raw forms of the training data is protected against the coordinator. Existing distributed machine learning and data encryption approaches incur significant computation and communication overhead, rendering them ill-suited for resource-constrained IoT objects. We study an approach that applies independent Gaussian random projection at each IoT object to obfuscate data and trains a deep neural network at the coordinator based on the projected data from the IoT objects. This approach introduces light computation overhead to the IoT objects and moves most workload to the coordinator that can have sufficient computing resources. Although the independent projections performed by the IoT objects address the potential collusion between the curious coordinator and some compromised IoT objects, they significantly increase the complexity of the projected data. In this paper, we leverage the superior learning capability of deep learning in capturing sophisticated patterns to maintain good learning performance. Extensive comparative evaluation shows that this approach outperforms other lightweight approaches that apply additive noisification for differential privacy and/or support vector machines for learning in the applications with light data pattern complexities.",

In such cases, collection of information can be done through IoT sensors and it can be sent directly to the processing hubs.

Specifically, it is shown how the time/frequency structure of signals can be exploited to enhance the receiver performance. Second, the performance of each channel is characterized with both link level simulations and implementation on a commercially deployed Qualcomm(registered) FSM(Trade Mark) platform [1]. Comparisons against the 3GPP defined Radio Performance and Protocol aspect requirements are also provided. Finally, implementation details are addressed and discussions on proposed enhancements to NB-IoT in 3GPP Release 15 are provided. It is shown how the proposed receiver algorithms can be adopted to Release 15 enhancements with minor or no modifications.

This lack of homogeneity makes the integration and security management of IoT infrastructures a daunting task for users and administrators. In this paper, we introduce VISCR, a Vendor-Independent policy Specification and Conflict Resolution engine that enables conflict-free policy specification and enforcement in IoT environments. VISCR converts the topology of the IoT infrastructure into a tree-based abstraction and translates existing policies from heterogeneous vendor-specific programming languages such as Groovy-based SmartThings, OpenHAB, IFTTT-based templates, and MUD-based profiles into a vendor-independent graph-based specification. Using the two, VISCR can automatically detect rouge policies, conflicts, and bugs for coherent automation. Upon detection, VISCR infers new policies and proposes them to users as alternatives to existing policies for fine-tuning and conflict-free enforcement. We evaluated VISCR using a dataset of 907 IoT apps, programmed using heterogeneous automation specifications in a simulated smart-building IoT infrastructure. In our experiments, among 907 IoT apps, VISCR exposed 342 of IoT apps as exhibiting one or more violations. VISCR detected 100% of violations reported by existing state-of-the-art tool, while detecting new types of violations in an additional 266 apps. In terms of performance, VISCR can generate 400 abstraction trees (used in specifying policies) with 100K leaf nodes in <1.2sec. In our experiments, VISCR took 80.7 seconds to analyze our infrastructure of 907 apps; a 14.2X reduction compared to the state-of-the-art.

However, as it grew, IoT networks were not capable of managing the data from these services. As a result, cloud computing was introduced to address the need for datacentres for IoT networks. As the technology evolved, the demand for a proper means of supporting and managing crowdsensing and real-time data increased, and cloud servers could no longer keep up with the large volumes of incoming data. This demand brought rise to fog computing. It became an extension to the cloud and allowed resources to be allocated around the network effectively. Its integration to IoT reduced the strain towards the cloud servers. However, issues in high power consumption at the end device and data management constraints surfaced. This paper proposes two approaches to alleviate these issues to keep fog computing remain as a reliable option for IoT-related applications. We created an IoT-based sensing framework that used an urban sound classification model. Through active low and high power states and resource reallocation, we created a network configuration. We tested this configuration against IoT frameworks that use the default fog and cloud setups. The results improved the framework's end device power consumption and server latency. Overall, with the proposed framework, fog computing was proven to be capable of supporting a scalable IoT framework for urban sound sensing.",

This work proposes to utilize blockchain technology to realize a trusted and transparent decentralized marketplace for contract compliance for trading IoT data streams generated by battery-operated IoT devices in real-time. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) we propose an autonomous blockchain-based marketplace equipped with essential functionalities such as agreement framework, pricing model and rating mechanism to create an effective marketplace framework without involving a mediator, (2) we propose a mechanism for selection and allocation of buyers' demands on seller's devices under quality and battery constraints. We present a proof-of-concept implementation in Ethereum to demonstrate the feasibility of the framework. We investigated the impact of buyer's demand on the battery drainage of the IoT devices under different scenarios through extensive simulations. Our results show that this approach is viable and benefits the seller and buyer for creating a sustainable marketplace model for trading IoT data in real-time from battery-powered IoT devices.",

OFDM continues its adoption in the new IoT Wi-Fi standard due to its spectrum efficiency that can support the demand of massive IoT connectivity. While the IoT Wi-Fi standard offers many new features to improve power and spectrum efficiency, the basic physical layer (PHY) structure of transceiver design still conforms to its conventional design rationale where access points (AP) and clients employ the same OFDM PHY. In this paper, we argue that current Wi-Fi PHY design does not take full advantage of the inherent asymmetry between AP and IoT. To fill the gap, we propose an asymmetric design where IoT devices transmit uplink packets using the lowest power while pushing all the decoding burdens to the AP side. Such a design utilizes the sufficient power and computational resources at AP to trade for the transmission (TX) power of IoT devices. The core technique enabling this asymmetric design is that the AP takes full power of its high clock rate to boost the decoding ability. We provide an implementation of our design and show that it can reduce up to 88% of the IoT's TX power when the AP sets $8\\times$ clock rate.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider an overlay satellite-terrestrial network (OSTN) where an opportunistically selected terrestrial internet-of-things (IoT) network assists the primary satellite communications as well as accesses the spectrum for its own communications under hybrid interference received from extra-terrestrial sources (ETSs) and terrestrial sources (TSs). Herein, the IoT network adopts power-domain multiplexing to amplify-and-forward the superposed satellite and IoT signals. Considering a unified analytical framework for shadowed-Rician fading with integer/non-integer Nakagami-\\emph{m} parameter for satellite and interfering ETSs links along with the integer/non-integer Nakagami-\\emph{m} fading for terrestrial IoT and interfering TSs links, we derive the outage probability (OP) of both satellite and IoT networks. Further, we derive the respective asymptotic OP expressions to reveal the diversity order of both satellite and IoT networks under the two conditions, namely when the transmit power of interferers: $(a)$ remains fixed; and $(b)$ varies proportional to the transmit powers of main satellite and IoT users. We show that the proposed OSTN with adaptive power-splitting factor benefits the IoT network while guaranteeing certain quality-of-service (QoS) of satellite network. We verify the numerical results by simulations.",

Because of easy accessibility and fast-growing demand for smart devices and network, IoT is now facing more security challenges than ever before. There are existing security measures that can be applied to protect IoT. However, traditional techniques are not as efficient with the advancement booms as well as different attack types and their severeness. Thus, a strong-dynamically enhanced and up to date security system is required for next-generation IoT system. A huge technological advancement has been noticed in Machine Learning (ML) which has opened many possible research windows to address ongoing and future challenges in IoT. In order to detect attacks and identify abnormal behaviors of smart devices and networks, ML is being utilized as a powerful technology to fulfill this purpose. In this survey paper, the architecture of IoT is discussed, following a comprehensive literature review on ML approaches the importance of security of IoT in terms of different types of possible attacks. Moreover, ML-based potential solutions for IoT security has been presented and future challenges are discussed.",

Recent research focuses on addressing security issues by looking inside platform and apps. In this work, we creatively change the angle to consider security problems from a wireless context perspective. We propose a novel framework called IoTGaze, which can discover potential anomalies and vulnerabilities in the IoT system via wireless traffic analysis. By sniffing the encrypted wireless traffic, IoTGaze can automatically identify the sequential interaction of events between apps and devices. We discover the temporal event dependencies and generate the Wireless Context for the IoT system. Meanwhile, we extract the IoT Context, which reflects user's expectation, from IoT apps' descriptions and user interfaces. If the wireless context does not match the expected IoT context, IoTGaze reports an anomaly. Furthermore, IoTGaze can discover the vulnerabilities caused by the inter-app interaction via hidden channels, such as temperature and illuminance. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation and evaluation of our framework on the Samsung SmartThings platform. The evaluation shows that IoTGaze can effectively discover anomalies and vulnerabilities, thereby greatly enhancing the security of IoT systems.",

    "abstract": "Journalists have long been the targets of both physical and cyber-attacks from well-resourced adversaries. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are arguably a new avenue of threat towards journalists through both targeted and generalised cyber-physical exploitation. This study comprises three parts: First, we interviewed 11 journalists and surveyed 5 further journalists, to determine the extent to which journalists perceive threats through the IoT, particularly via consumer IoT devices. Second, we surveyed 34 cyber security experts to establish if and how lay-people can combat IoT threats. Third, we compared these findings to assess journalists' knowledge of threats, and whether their protective mechanisms would be effective against experts' depictions and predictions of IoT threats. Our results indicate that journalists generally are unaware of IoT-related risks and are not adequately protecting themselves; this considers cases where they possess IoT devices, or where they enter IoT-enabled environments (e.g., at work or home). Expert recommendations spanned both immediate and long-term mitigation methods, including practical actions that are technical and socio-political in nature. However, all proposed individual mitigation methods are likely to be short-term solutions, with 26 of 34 (76.5%) of cyber security experts responding that within the next five years it will not be possible for the public to opt-out of interaction with the IoT.",

    "abstract": "Attracted by the inherent security and privacy protection of the blockchain, incorporating blockchain into Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely studied in these years. However, the mining process requires high computational power, which prevents IoT devices from directly participating in blockchain construction. For this reason, edge computing service is introduced to help build the IoT blockchain, where IoT devices could purchase computational resources from the edge servers. In this paper, we consider the case that IoT devices also have other tasks that need the help of edge servers, such as data analysis and data storage. The profits they can get from these tasks is closely related to the amounts of resources they purchased from the edge servers. In this scenario, IoT devices will allocate their limited budgets to purchase different resources from different edge servers, such that their profits can be maximized. Moreover, edge servers will set \"best\" prices such that they can get the biggest benefits. Accordingly, there raise a pricing and budget allocation problem between edge servers and IoT devices. We model the interaction between edge servers and IoT devices as a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game, whose objective is to reach the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE). We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SE point, and design efficient algorithms to reach the SE point. In the end, we verify our model and algorithms by performing extensive simulations, and the results show the correctness and effectiveness of our designs.",

    "abstract": "Resource management in Internet of Things (IoT) systems is a major challenge due to the massive scale and heterogeneity of the IoT system. For instance, most IoT applications require timely delivery of collected information, which is a key challenge for the IoT. In this paper, novel centralized and distributed resource allocation schemes are proposed to enable IoT devices to share limited communication resources and to transmit IoT messages in a timely manner. In the considered system, the timeliness of information is captured using non-linear age of information (AoI) metrics that can naturally quantify the freshness of information. To model the inherent heterogeneity of the IoT system, the non-linear aging functions are defined in terms of IoT device types and message content. To minimize AoI, the proposed resource management schemes allocate the limited communication resources considering AoI. In particular, the proposed centralized scheme enables the base station to learn the device types and to determine aging functions. Moreover, the proposed distributed scheme enables the devices to share the limited communication resources based on available information on other devices and their AoI. The convergence of the proposed distributed scheme is proved, and the effectiveness in reducing the AoI with partial information is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed centralized scheme achieves significantly lower average instantaneous AoI when compared to simple centralized allocation without learning, while the proposed distributed scheme achieves significantly lower average instantaneous AoI when compared to random allocation. The results also show that the proposed centralized scheme outperforms the proposed distributed scheme in almost all cases, but the distributed approach is more viable for a massive IoT.",

Based on the nature of the application, these devices will result in big or fast/real-time data streams. Applying analytics over such data streams to discover new information, predict future insights, and make control decisions is a crucial process that makes IoT a worthy paradigm for businesses and a quality-of-life improving technology. In this paper, we provide a thorough overview on using a class of advanced machine learning techniques, namely Deep Learning (DL), to facilitate the analytics and learning in the IoT domain. We start by articulating IoT data characteristics and identifying two major treatments for IoT data from a machine learning perspective, namely IoT big data analytics and IoT streaming data analytics. We also discuss why DL is a promising approach to achieve the desired analytics in these types of data and applications. The potential of using emerging DL techniques for IoT data analytics are then discussed, and its promises and challenges are introduced. We present a comprehensive background on different DL architectures and algorithms. We also analyze and summarize major reported research attempts that leveraged DL in the IoT domain. The smart IoT devices that have incorporated DL in their intelligence background are also discussed. DL implementation approaches on the fog and cloud centers in support of IoT applications are also surveyed. Finally, we shed light on some challenges and potential directions for future research.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates billions of smart devices that can communicate with one another with minimal human intervention. It is one of the fastest developing fields in the history of computing, with an estimated 50 billion devices by the end of 2020. On the one hand, IoT play a crucial role in enhancing several real-life smart applications that can improve life quality. On the other hand, the crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the multidisciplinary components involved in the deployment of such systems introduced new security challenges. Implementing security measures, such as encryption, authentication, access control, network security and application security, for IoT devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective. Therefore, existing security methods should be enhanced to secure the IoT system effectively. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have advanced considerably over the last few years, and machine intelligence has transitioned from laboratory curiosity to practical machinery in several important applications. Consequently, ML/DL methods are important in transforming the security of IoT systems from merely facilitating secure communication between devices to security-based intelligence systems. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive survey of ML /DL methods that can be used to develop enhanced security methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are related to inherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and various potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related to each surface are discussed. We then thoroughly review ML/DL methods for IoT security and present the opportunities, advantages and shortcomings of each method. We discuss the opportunities and challenges involved in applying ML/DL to IoT security. These opportunities and challenges can serve as potential future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Information Centric Networking is a new networking paradigm that treats content as first class entity. It provides content to users without regards to the current location of the content. The publish/subscribe systems have gained popularity in Internet. Pub/sub systems dismisses the need for users to request every content of their interest. Instead, the content is supplied to interested users (subscribers) as and when it is published. CCN/NDN are popular ICN proposals widely accepted in the ICN community however, they do not provide an efficient pub/sub mechanism. COPSS enhances CCN/NDN with an efficient pub/sub capability. Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing topic of interest in both Academia and Industry. The current designs for IoT relies on IP. However, the IoT devices are constrained in their available resources and IP is heavy for their operation.We observed that IoT's are information centric in nature and hence ICN is a more suitable candidate to support IoT environments. Although NDN and COPSS work well for the Internet, their current full fledged implementations cannot be used by the resource constrained IoT devices. CCN-lite is a light weight, inter-operable version of the CCNx protocol for supporting the IoT devices. However, CCN-lite like its ancestors lacks the support for an efficient pub/sub mechanism. In this paper, we developed COPSS-lite, an efficient and light weight implementation of pub/sub for IoT. COPSS-lite is developed to enhance CCN-lite and also support multi-hop connection by incorporating the famous RPL protocol for low power and lossy networks. We provide a preliminary evaluation to show proof of operability with real world sensor devices in IoT lab. Our results show that COPSS-lite is compact, operates on all platforms that support CCN-lite and we observe significant performance benefits with COPSS-lite in IoT environments.",

Due to the widespread adoption of such devices, their diversity, standardization obstacles, and inherent mobility, organizations require an intelligent mechanism capable of automatically detecting suspicious IoT devices connected to their networks. In particular, devices not included in a white list of trustworthy IoT device types (allowed to be used within the organizational premises) should be detected. In this research, Random Forest, a supervised machine learning algorithm, was applied to features extracted from network traffic data with the aim of accurately identifying IoT device types from the white list. To train and evaluate multi-class classifiers, we collected and manually labeled network traffic data from 17 distinct IoT devices, representing nine types of IoT devices. Based on the classification of 20 consecutive sessions and the use of majority rule, IoT device types that are not on the white list were correctly detected as unknown in 96% of test cases (on average), and white listed device types were correctly classified by their actual types in 99% of cases. Some IoT device types were identified quicker than others (e.g., sockets and thermostats were successfully detected within five TCP sessions of connecting to the network). Perfect detection of unauthorized IoT device types was achieved upon analyzing 110 consecutive sessions; perfect classification of white listed types required 346 consecutive sessions, 110 of which resulted in 99.49% accuracy. Further experiments demonstrated the successful applicability of classifiers trained in one location and tested on another. In addition, a discussion is provided regarding the resilience of our machine learning-based IoT white listing method to adversarial attacks.",

These devices' goal is to gather data and drive actions in order to improve productivity, and ultimately reduce or eliminate reliance on human intervention for data acquisition, interpretation, and use. The proliferation of these connected low-power devices will result in a data explosion that will significantly increase data transmission costs with respect to energy consumption and latency. Edge computing reduces these costs by performing computations at the edge nodes, prior to data transmission, to interpret and/or utilize the data. While much research has focused on the IoT's connected nature and communication challenges, the challenges of IoT embedded computing with respect to device microprocessors has received much less attention. This paper explores IoT applications' execution characteristics from a microarchitectural perspective and the microarchitectural characteristics that will enable efficient and effective edge computing. To tractably represent a wide variety of next-generation IoT applications, we present a broad IoT application classification methodology based on application functions, to enable quicker workload characterizations for IoT microprocessors. We then survey and discuss potential microarchitectural optimizations and computing paradigms that will enable the design of right-provisioned microprocessors that are efficient, configurable, extensible, and scalable.

    "abstract": "The Internet of things (IoT) will make it possible to interconnect and simultaneously control distributed electrical loads. Various technical and regulatory concerns have been raised that IoT-operated loads are being deployed without appropriately considering and systematically addressing potential cyber-security challenges. Hence, one can envision a hypothetical scenario when an ensemble of IoT-controlled loads can be hacked with malicious intentions of compromising operations of the electrical grid. Under this scenario, the attacker would use geographically distributed IoT-controlled loads to alternate their net power injections into the electrical grid in such a way that may disrupt normal grid operations. This paper presents a modeling framework to analyze grid impacts of distributed cyber-attacks on IoT-controlled loads. This framework is used to demonstrate how a hypothetical distributed cyber-attack propagates from the distribution electrical grid, where IoT-controlled loads are expected to be installed, to the transmission electrical grid. The techno-economic interactions between the distribution and transmission electrical grids are accounted for by means of bilevel optimization. The case study is carried out on the modified versions of the 3-area IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) and the IEEE 13-bus distribution feeder. Our numerical results demonstrate that the severity of such attacks depends on the penetration level of IoT-controlled loads and the strategy of the attacker.",

In this paper, we explore how a Privacy-by-Design (PbD) framework, formulated as a set of guidelines, can help software engineers integrate data privacy considerations into the design of IoT applications. We studied the utility of this PbD framework by studying how software engineers use it to design IoT applications. We also explore the challenges in using the set of guidelines to influence the IoT applications design process. In addition to highlighting the benefits of having a PbD framework to make privacy features explicit during the design of IoT applications, our studies also surfaced a number of challenges associated with the approach. A key finding of our research is that the PbD framework significantly increases both novice and expert software engineers' ability to design privacy into IoT applications.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) will encompass a massive number of machine type devices that must wirelessly transmit, in near real-time, a diverse set of messages sensed from their environment. Designing resource allocation schemes to support such coexistent, heterogeneous communication is hence a key IoT challenge. In particular, there is a need for self-organizing resource allocation solutions that can account for unique IoT features, such as massive scale and stringent resource constraints. In this paper, a novel finite memory multi-state sequential learning framework is proposed to enable diverse IoT devices to share limited communication resources, while transmitting both delay-tolerant, periodic messages and urgent, critical messages. The proposed learning framework enables the IoT devices to learn the number of critical messages and to reallocate the communication resources for the periodic messages to be used for the critical messages. Furthermore, the proposed learning framework explicitly accounts for IoT device limitations in terms of memory and computational capabilities. The convergence of the proposed learning framework is proved, and the lowest expected delay that the IoT devices can achieve using this learning framework is derived. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm in IoT networks with different delay targets, network densities, probabilities of detection, and memory sizes is analyzed in terms of the probability of a successful random access request and percentage of devices that learned correctly. The results show that the proposed learning algorithm is very effective in reducing the delay of urgent, critical messages by intelligently reallocating the communication resources allocated to the delay-tolerant, periodic messages.",

We propose a reinforcement learning based computation offloading framework for an IoT device to choose the MEC device and determine the offloading rate according to the current battery level, the previous radio bandwidth to each MEC device and the predicted amount of the harvested energy. A \"hotbooting\" Q-learning based computation offloading scheme is proposed for an IoT device to achieve the optimal offloading performance without being aware of the MEC model, the energy consumption and computation latency model. We also propose a fast deep Q-network (DQN) based offloading scheme, which combines the deep learning and hotbooting techniques to accelerate the learning speed of Q-learning. We show that the proposed schemes can achieve the optimal offloading policy after sufficiently long learning time and provide their performance bounds under two typical MEC scenarios. Simulations are performed for IoT devices that use wireless power transfer to capture the ambient radio-frequency signals to charge the IoT batteries. Simulation results show that the fast DQN-based offloading scheme reduces the energy consumption, decreases the computation delay and the task drop ratio, and increases the utility of the IoT device in dynamic MEC, compared with the benchmark Q-learning based offloading.",

Advanced communication technology enables a heterogeneous connectivity where mobile devices broadcast information to everything. Mobile applications such as robotics and vehicles connecting to cloud and surroundings transfer the short-range on-board sensor perception system to long-range mobile-sensing perception system. However, the mobile sensing perception brings new challenges for how to efficiently analyze and intelligently interpret the deluge of IoT data in mission- critical services. In this article, we model the challenges as latency, packet loss and measurement noise which severely deteriorate the reliability and quality of IoT data. We integrate the artificial intelligence into IoT to tackle these challenges. We propose a novel architecture that leverages recurrent neural networks (RNN) and Kalman filtering to anticipate motions and interac- tions between objects. The basic idea is to learn environment dynamics by recurrent networks. To improve the robustness of IoT communication, we use the idea of Kalman filtering and deploy a prediction and correction step. In this way, the architecture learns to develop a biased belief between prediction and measurement in the different situation. We demonstrate our approach with synthetic and real-world datasets with noise that mimics the challenges of IoT communications. Our method brings a new level of IoT intelligence. It is also lightweight compared to other state-of-the-art convolutional recurrent architecture and is ideally suitable for the resource-limited mobile applications.",

    "abstract": "The conventional high-speed Wi-Fi has recently become a contender for low-power Internet-of-Things (IoT) communications. OFDM continues its adoption in the new IoT Wi-Fi standard due to its spectrum efficiency that can support the demand of massive IoT connectivity. While the IoT Wi-Fi standard offers many new features to improve power and spectrum efficiency, the basic physical layer (PHY) structure of transceiver design still conforms to its conventional design rationale where access points (AP) and clients employ the same OFDM PHY. In this paper, we argue that current Wi-Fi PHY design does not take full advantage of the inherent asymmetry between AP and IoT. To fill the gap, we propose an asymmetric design where IoT devices transmit uplink packets using the lowest power while pushing all the decoding burdens to the AP side. Such a design utilizes the sufficient power and computational resources at AP to trade for the transmission (TX) power of IoT devices. The core technique enabling this asymmetric design is that the AP takes full power of its high clock rate to boost the decoding ability. We provide an implementation of our design and show that it can reduce the IoT's TX power by boosting the decoding capability at the receivers.",

This paper aims to assist IoT manufacturers in developing and verifying MUD profiles, while also helping adopters of these devices to ensure they are compatible with their organizational policies. Our first contribution is to develop a tool that takes the traffic trace of an arbitrary IoT device as input and automatically generates a MUD profile for it. We contribute our tool as open source, apply it to 28 consumer IoT devices, and highlight insights and challenges encountered in the process. Our second contribution is to apply a formal semantic framework that not only validates a given MUD profile for consistency, but also checks its compatibility with a given organizational policy. Finally, we apply our framework to representative organizations and selected devices, to demonstrate how MUD can reduce the effort needed for IoT acceptance testing.",

    "abstract": "A number of Internet of Things (IoTs) platforms have emerged to enable various IoT apps developed by third-party developers to automate smart homes. Prior research mostly concerns the overprivilege problem in the permission model. Our work, however, reveals that even IoT apps that follow the principle of least privilege, when they interplay, can cause unique types of threats, named Cross-App Interference (CAI) threats. We describe and categorize the new threats, showing that unexpected automation, security and privacy issues may be caused by such threats, which cannot be handled by existing IoT security mechanisms. To address this problem, we present HOMEGUARD, a system for appified IoT platforms to detect and cope with CAI threats. A symbolic executor module is built to precisely extract the automation semantics from IoT apps. The semantics of different IoT apps are then considered collectively to evaluate their interplay and discover CAI threats systematically. A user interface is presented to users during IoT app installation, interpreting the discovered threats to help them make decisions. We evaluate HOMEGUARD via a proof-of-concept implementation on Samsung SmartThings and discover many threat instances among apps in the SmartThings public repository. The evaluation shows that it is precise, effective and efficient.",

    "abstract": "Today we see the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in various application domains such as healthcare, smart homes, smart cars, and smart-x applications in smart cities. The number of applications based on IoT and cloud computing is projected to increase rapidly over the next few years. IoT-based services must meet the guaranteed levels of quality of service (QoS) to match users' expectations. Ensuring QoS through specifying the QoS constraints using Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is crucial. Therefore, as a first step toward SLA management, it is essential to provide an SLA specification in a machine-readable format. In this paper, we demonstrate a toolkit for creating SLA specifications for IoT applications. The toolkit is used to simplify the process of capturing the requirements of IoT applications. We present a demonstration of the toolkit using a Remote Health Monitoring Service (RHMS) usecase. The toolkit supports the following: (1) specifying the Service-Level Objectives (SLO) of an IoT application at the application level; (2) specifying the workflow activities of the IoT application; (3) mapping each activity to the required software and hardware resources and specifying the constraints of SLOs and other configuration- related metrics of the required hardware and software; and (4) creating the composed SLA in JSON format.",

    "abstract": "Stringent latency requirements in advanced Internet of Things (IoT) applications as well as an increased load on cloud data centers have prompted a move towards a more decentralized approach, bringing storage and processing of IoT data closer to the end-devices through the deployment of multi-purpose IoT gateways. However, the resource constrained nature and diversity of these gateways pose a challenge in developing applications that can be deployed widely. This challenge can be overcome with containerization, a form of lightweight virtualization, bringing support for a wide range of hardware architectures and operating system agnostic deployment of applications on IoT gateways. This paper discusses the architectural aspects of containerization, and studies the suitability of available containerization tools for multi-container deployment in the context of IoT gateways. We present containerization in the context of AGILE, a multi-container and micro-service based open source framework for IoT gateways, developed as part of a Horizon 2020 project. Our study of containerized services to perform common gateway functions like device discovery, data management and cloud integration among others, reveal the advantages of having a containerized environment for IoT gateways with regard to use of base image hierarchies and image layering for in-container and cross-container performance optimizations. We illustrate these results in a set of benchmark experiments in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the number of Internet of Thing (IoT) devices making up the IoT is more than 11 billion and this number has been continuously increasing. The prevalence of these devices leads to an emerging IoT business model called Device-as-a-service(DaaS), which enables sensor devices to collect data disseminated to all interested devices. The devices sharing data with other devices could receive some financial reward such as Bitcoin. However, side-channel attacks, which aim to exploit some information leaked from the IoT devices during data trade execution, are possible since most of the IoT devices are vulnerable to be hacked or compromised. Thus, it is challenging to securely realize data trading in IoT environment due to the information leakage such as leaking the private key for signing a Bitcoin transaction in Bitcoin system. In this paper, we propose LRCoin, a kind of leakage-resilient cryptocurrency based on bitcoin in which the signature algorithm used for authenticating bitcoin transactions is leakage-resilient. LRCoin is suitable for the scenarios where information leakage is inevitable such as IoT applications. Our core contribution is proposing an efficient bilinear-based continual-leakage-resilient ECDSA signature. We prove the proposed signature algorithm is unforgeable against adaptively chosen messages attack in the generic bilinear group model under the continual leakage setting. Both the theoretical analysis and the implementation demonstrate the practicability of the proposed scheme.",

Due to the market pressure, IoT systems may be released without sufficient testing. However, it is no longer acceptable to release IoT systems to the market without assuring the quality. As in the case of new technologies, the quality assurance process is a challenging task. This paper shows the results of the first comprehensive and systematic mapping study to structure and categories the research evidence in the literature starting in 2009 when the early publication of IoT papers for IoT quality assurance appeared. The conducted research is based on the most recent guidelines on how to perform systematic mapping studies. A set of research questions is defined carefully regarding the quality aspects of the IoT. Based on these questions, a large number of evidence and research papers is considered in the study (478 papers). We have extracted and analyzed different levels of information from those considered papers. Also, we have classified the topics addressed in those papers into categories based on the quality aspects. The study results carry out different areas that require more work and investigation in the context of IoT quality assurance. The results of the study can help in a further understanding of the research gaps. Moreover, the results show a roadmap for future research directions.",

The Mirai attack on Dyn DNS service, in which vulnerable IoT devices such as IP cameras, DVRs and routers were infected and used to propagate large-scale DDoS attacks, is one of the more prominent recent examples. IoT botnets, consisting of hundreds-of-thousands of bots, are currently present ``in-the-wild'' at least and are only expected to grow in the future, with the potential to cause significant network downtimes and financial losses to network companies. We propose, therefore, to build testbeds for evaluating IoT botnets and design suitable mitigation techniques against them. A DETERlab-based IoT botnet testbed is presented in this work. The testbed is built in a secure contained environment and includes ancillary services such as DHCP, DNS as well as botnet infrastructure including CnC and scanListen/loading servers. Developing an IoT botnet testbed presented us with some unique challenges which are different from those encountered in non-IoT botnet testbeds and we highlight them in this paper. Further, we point out the important features of our testbed and illustrate some of its capabilities through experimental results.",

Those devices are usually constrained with limited energy supply and can only operate at low power and low rate. In this paper, we investigate a cellular-based IoT system combined with energy harvesting and NOMA. We consider all base stations (BS) and IoT devices follow the Poisson Point Process (PPP) distribution in a given area. The unit time slot is divided into two phases, energy harvesting phase in downlink (DL) and data transmission phase in uplink (uplink). That is, IoT devices will first harvest energy from all BS transmissions and then use the harvested energy to do the NOMA information transmission. We define an energy harvesting circle within which all IoT devices can harvest enough energy for NOMA transmission. The design objective is to maximize the total throughput in uplink within the circle by varying the duration T of energy harvesting phase. In our work, we also consider the inter-cell interference in the throughput calculation. The analysis of Probability Mass Function (PMF) for IoT devices in the energy harvesting circle is also compared with simulation results. It is shown that the BS density needs to be carefully set so that the IoT devices in the energy harvesting circle receive relatively smaller interference and energy circles overlap only with a small probability. Our simulations show that there exists an optimal T to achieve the maximum throughput. When the BSs are densely deployed consequently the total throughput will decrease because of the interference.",

With the rise of dynamic network management and dynamic network programming technologies like Software-Defined Networking (SDN), traffic management and communication quality requirements can be tailored to fit niche use cases and characteristics. We propose a publish/subscribe QoS-aware framework (PSIoT-SDN) that orchestrates IoT traffic and mediates the allocation of network resources between IoT data aggregators and pub/sub consumers. The PSIoT framework allows edge-level QoS control using the features of publish/ subscribe orchestrator at IoT aggregators and, in addition, allows network-level QoS control by incorporating SDN features coupled with a bandwidth allocation model for networkwide IoT traffic management. The integration of the framework with SDN allows it to dynamically react to bandwidth sharing enabled by the SDN controller, resulting in better bandwidth distribution and higher link utilization for IoT traffic.",

This survey paper presents a review of the security challenges of emerging IoT networks and discusses some of the attacks and their countermeasures based on different domains in IoT networks. Most conventional solutions for IoT networks are adopted from communication networks while noting the particular characteristics of IoT networks such as the nodes quantity, heterogeneity, and the limited resources of the nodes, these conventional security methods are not adequate. One challenge toward utilizing common secret key-based cryptographic methods in large-scale IoTs is the problem of secret key generation, distribution, and storage and protecting these secret keys from physical attacks. Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) can be utilized as a possible hardware remedy for identification and authentication in IoTs. Since PUFs extract the unique hardware characteristics, they potentially offer an affordable and practical solution for secret key generation. However, several barriers limit the PUFs' applications for key generation purposes. We discuss the advantages of PUF-based key generation methods, and we present a survey of state-of-the-art techniques in this domain. We also present a proof-of-concept PUF-based solution for secret key generation using resistive random-access memories (ReRAM) embedded in IoTs.",

    "abstract": "Due to the high demand in computation and memory, deep learning solutions are mostly restricted to high-performance computing units, e.g., those present in servers, Cloud, and computing centers. In pervasive systems, e.g., those involving Internet-of-Things (IoT) technological solutions, this would require the transmission of acquired data from IoT sensors to the computing platform and wait for its output. This solution might become infeasible when remote connectivity is either unavailable or limited in bandwidth. Moreover, it introduces uncertainty in the \"data production to decision making\"-latency, which, in turn, might impair control loop stability if the response should be used to drive IoT actuators. In order to support a real-time recall phase directly at the IoT level, deep learning solutions must be completely rethought having in mind the constraints on memory and computation characterizing IoT units. In this paper we focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specific deep learning solution for image and video classification, and introduce a methodology aiming at distributing their computation onto the units of the IoT system. We formalize such a methodology as an optimization problem where the latency between the data-gathering phase and the subsequent decision-making one is minimized. The methodology supports multiple IoT sources of data as well as multiple CNNs in execution on the same IoT system, making it a general-purpose distributed computing platform for CNN-based applications demanding autonomy, low decision-latency, and high Quality-of-Service.",

The nodes in the cell are assumed to generate data samples periodically, which are to be transmitted to the AP. The AP hosts a machine learning model, such as a neural network, which is trained on the received data samples to make accurate inferences. We address the following tradeoff: The more often the IoT nodes transmit, the higher the accuracy of the inference made by the AP, but also the higher the energy expenditure at the IoT nodes. We propose a data filtering scheme employed by the IoT nodes, which we refer to as distributed importance filtering in order to filter out redundant data samples already at the IoT nodes. The IoT nodes do not have large on-device machine learning models and the data filtering scheme operates under periodic instructions from the model placed at the AP. The proposed scheme is evaluated using neural networks on a benchmark machine vision dataset, as well as in two practical scenarios: leakage detection in water distribution networks and air-pollution detection in urban areas. The results show that the proposed scheme offers significant benefits in terms of network longevity as it preserves the devices' resources, whilst maintaining high inference accuracy. Our approach reduces the the computational complexity for training the model and obviates the need for data pre-processing, which makes it highly applicable in practical IoT scenarios.",

In this paper, we define the data value and service quality from a machine learning perspective. We present an IoT market model which consists of data vendors selling data to service providers, and service providers offering IoT services to customers. Then, we introduce optimal pricing schemes for the standalone and bundled selling of IoT services. In standalone service sales, the service provider optimizes the size of bought data and service subscription fee to maximize its profit. For service bundles, the subscription fee and data sizes of the grouped IoT services are optimized to maximize the total profit of cooperative service providers. We show that bundling IoT services maximizes the profit of service providers compared to the standalone selling. For profit sharing of bundled services, we apply the concepts of core and Shapley solutions from cooperative game theory as efficient and fair allocations of payoffs among the cooperative service providers in the bundling coalition.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, it is imperative to proactively understand the real-world cybersecurity threats posed to them. This paper describes our initial efforts towards building a honeypot ecosystem as a means to gathering and analyzing real attack data against IoT devices. A primary condition for a honeypot to yield useful insights is to let attackers believe they are real systems used by humans and organizations. IoT devices pose unique challenges in this respect, due to the large variety of device types and the physical-connectedness nature. We thus create a multiphased approach in building a honeypot ecosystem, where researchers can gradually increase a low-interaction honeypot's sophistication in emulating an IoT device by observing real-world attackers' behaviors. We deployed honeypots both on-premise and in the cloud, with associated analysis and vetting infrastructures to ensure these honeypots cannot be easily identified as such and appear to be real systems. In doing so we were able to attract increasingly sophisticated attack data. We present the design of this honeypot ecosystem and our observation on the attack data so far. Our data shows that real-world attackers are explicitly going after IoT devices, and some captured activities seem to involve direct human interaction (as opposed to scripted automatic activities). We also build a low interaction honeypot for IoT cameras, called Honeycamera, that present to attackers seemingly real videos. This is our first step towards building a more comprehensive honeypot ecosystem that will allow researchers to gain concrete understanding of what attackers are going after on IoT devices, so as to more proactively protect them.",

This paper considers the design and implementation of a practical privacy-preserving collaborative learning scheme, in which a curious learning coordinator trains a better machine learning model based on the data samples contributed by a number of IoT objects, while the confidentiality of the raw forms of the training data is protected against the coordinator. Existing distributed machine learning and data encryption approaches incur significant computation and communication overhead, rendering them ill-suited for resource-constrained IoT objects. We study an approach that applies independent random projection at each IoT object to obfuscate data and trains a deep neural network at the coordinator based on the projected data from the IoT objects. This approach introduces light computation overhead to the IoT objects and moves most workload to the coordinator that can have sufficient computing resources. Although the independent projections performed by the IoT objects address the potential collusion between the curious coordinator and some compromised IoT objects, they significantly increase the complexity of the projected data. In this paper, we leverage the superior learning capability of deep learning in capturing sophisticated patterns to maintain good learning performance.

    "abstract": "Owing to the large volume of sensed data from the enormous number of IoT devices in operation today, centralized machine learning algorithms operating on such data incur an unbearable training time, and thus cannot satisfy the requirements of delay-sensitive inference applications. By provisioning computing resources at the network edge, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has become a promising technology capable of collaborating with distributed IoT devices to facilitate federated learning, and thus realize real-time training. However, considering the large volume of sensed data and the limited resources of both edge servers and IoT devices, it is challenging to ensure the training efficiency and accuracy of delay-sensitive training tasks. Thus, in this paper, we design a novel edge computing-assisted federated learning framework, in which the communication constraints between IoT devices and edge servers and the effect of various IoT devices on the training accuracy are taken into account. On one hand, we employ machine learning methods to dynamically configure the communication resources in real-time to accelerate the interactions between IoT devices and edge servers, thus improving the training efficiency of federated learning. On the other hand, as various IoT devices have different training datasets which have varying influence on the accuracy of the global model derived at the edge server, an IoT device selection scheme is designed to improve the training accuracy under the resource constraints at edge servers. Extensive simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the introduced edge computing-assisted federated learning framework.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is an innovative paradigm envisioned to provide massive applications that are now part of our daily lives. Millions of smart devices are deployed within complex networks to provide vibrant functionalities including communications, monitoring, and controlling of critical infrastructures. However, this massive growth of IoT devices and the corresponding huge data traffic generated at the edge of the network created additional burdens on the state-of-the-art centralized cloud computing paradigm due to the bandwidth and resources scarcity. Hence, edge computing (EC) is emerging as an innovative strategy that brings data processing and storage near to the end users, leading to what is called EC-assisted IoT. Although this paradigm provides unique features and enhanced quality of service (QoS), it also introduces huge risks in data security and privacy aspects. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on security and privacy issues in the context of EC-assisted IoT. In particular, we first present an overview of EC-assisted IoT including definitions, applications, architecture, advantages, and challenges. Second, we define security and privacy in the context of EC-assisted IoT. Then, we extensively discuss the major classifications of attacks in EC-assisted IoT and provide possible solutions and countermeasures along with the related research efforts. After that, we further classify some security and privacy issues as discussed in the literature based on security services and based on security objectives and functions. Finally, several open challenges and future research directions for secure EC-assisted IoT paradigm are also extensively provided.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, many semantic-based routing protocols had been designed for peer-to-peer systems. However, they are not suitable for IoT systems, mainly due to their high demands in memory and computing power which are not available in many IoT devices. In this paper, we develop a semantic-based routing protocol for dynamic IoT systems to facilitate dynamic IoT capability discovery and composition. Our protocol is a fully decentralized routing protocol. To reduce the space requirement for routing, each node maintains a summarized routing table. We design an ontology-based summarization algorithm to smartly group similar capabilities in the routing tables and support adaptive routing table compression. We also design an ontology coding scheme to code keywords used in the routing tables and query messages. To complete the summarization scheme, we consider the metrics for choosing the summarization candidates in an overflowing routing table. Some of these metrics are novel and are difficult to measure, such as coverage and stability. Our solutions significantly reduce the routing table size, ensuring that the routing table size can be bounded by the available memory of the IoT devices, while supporting efficient IoT capability lookup. Experimental results show that our approach can yield significantly lower network traffic and memory requirement for IoT capability lookup when compared with existing semantic-based routing algorithms including a centralized solution, a DHT-based approach, a controlled flooding scheme, and a cache-based solution.",

For example, these data can be related to pollution and gas emissions, which can be used to check the compliance with national and international regulations. The current approach for IoT data trading relies on a centralized third-party entity to negotiate between data consumers and data providers, which is inefficient and insecure on a large scale. In comparison, a decentralized approach based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT) enables data trading while ensuring trust, security, and privacy. However, due to the lack of understanding of the communication efficiency between sellers and buyers, there is still a significant gap in benchmarking the data trading protocols in IoT environments. Motivated by this knowledge gap, we introduce a model for DLT-based IoT data trading over the Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) system, intended to support massive environmental sensing. We characterize the communication efficiency of three basic DLT-based IoT data trading protocols via NB-IoT connectivity in terms of latency and energy consumption. The model and analyses of these protocols provide a benchmark for IoT data trading applications.",

They typically generate a large volume of data on the internet of things (IoT) application areas like smart cities, intelligent traffic systems, smart grid, and e-health. Cloud, edge and fog computing are potential and competitive strategies for collecting, processing, and distributing IoT data. However, cloud, edge, and fog-based solutions need to tackle the distribution of a high volume of IoT data efficiently through constrained and limited resource network infrastructures. This paper addresses the issue of conveying a massive volume of IoT data through a network with limited communications resources (bandwidth) using a cognitive communications resource allocation based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with SARSA algorithm. The proposed network infrastructure (PSIoTRL) uses a Publish/ Subscribe architecture to access massive and highly distributed IoT data. It is demonstrated that the PSIoTRL bandwidth allocation for buffer flushing based on SARSA enhances the IoT aggregator buffer occupation and network link utilization. The PSIoTRL dynamically adapts the IoT aggregator traffic flushing according to the Pub/Sub topic's priority and network constraint requirements.",

The security pitfalls of IoT devices have made it easy for hackers to take over IoT devices and use them for malicious activities like botnet attacks. With the rampant emergence of IoT devices, botnet attacks are surging. The botnet attacks are not only catastrophic for IoT device users but also for the rest of the world. Therefore, there is a crucial need to identify and mitigate the possible threats in IoT devices during the design phase. Threat modelling is a technique that is used to identify the threats in the earlier stages of the system design activity. In this paper, we propose a threat modelling approach to analyze and mitigate the botnet attacks in an IoT smart home use case. The proposed methodology identifies the development-level and application-level threats in smart home use case using STRIDE and VAST threat modelling methods. Moreover, we reticulate the identified threats with botnet attacks. Finally, we propose the mitigation techniques for all identified threats including the botnet threats.",

Such tools allow them to retrieve the data they want without knowing the underlying technical details of the sensors and the data processing components.

We incorporate semantic technologies in solving the above challenges. We demonstrate the feasibility and the scalability of our approach through a prototype implementation based on an IoT middleware called Global Sensor Networks (GSN), though our model can be generalized into any other middleware platform. We evaluate CASCoM in agriculture domain and measure both performance in terms of usability and computational complexity.",

As the IoT represents future state of the Internet, an intelligent and scalable architecture is required to provide connectivity between these silos, enabling discovery of physical sensors and interpretation of messages between things. This paper proposes a gateway and Semantic Web enabled IoT architecture to provide interoperability between systems using established communication and data standards. The Semantic Gateway as Service (SGS) allows translation between messaging protocols such as XMPP, CoAP and MQTT via a multi-protocol proxy architecture. Utilization of broadly accepted specifications such as W3C's Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology for semantic annotations of sensor data provide semantic interoperability between messages and support semantic reasoning to obtain higher-level actionable knowledge from low-level sensor data.",

To study the performance of data reception rate, packet loss rate and latency, we evaluate the IoT-MAC and scheduling algorithm with varying data rate and different network scale.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing scale of deployment of Internet of Things (IoT), concerns about IoT security have become more urgent. In particular, memory corruption attacks play a predominant role as they allow remote compromise of IoT devices. Control-flow integrity (CFI) is a promising and generic defense technique against these attacks. However, given the nature of IoT deployments, existing protection mechanisms for traditional computing environments (including CFI) need to be adapted to the IoT setting. In this paper, we describe the challenges of enabling CFI on microcontroller (MCU) based IoT devices. We then present CaRE, the first interrupt-aware CFI scheme for low-end MCUs. CaRE uses a novel way of protecting the CFI metadata by leveraging TrustZone-M security extensions introduced in the ARMv8-M architecture. Its binary instrumentation approach preserves the memory layout of the target MCU software, allowing pre-built bare-metal binary code to be protected by CaRE. We describe our implementation on a Cortex-M Prototyping System and demonstrate that CaRE is secure while imposing acceptable performance and memory impact.",

This framework is designed to overcome the challenges including high computation costs, low flexibility in key management, and low compatibility in deploying new security algorithms in IoT, especially when adopting advanced cryptographic primitives.

    "abstract": "Due to their rapid growth and deployment, Internet of things (IoT) devices have become a central aspect of our daily lives. However, they tend to have many vulnerabilities which can be exploited by an attacker. Unsupervised techniques, such as anomaly detection, can help us secure the IoT devices. However, an anomaly detection model must be trained for a long time in order to capture all benign behaviors. This approach is vulnerable to adversarial attacks since all observations are assumed to be benign while training the anomaly detection model. In this paper, we propose CIoTA, a lightweight framework that utilizes the blockchain concept to perform distributed and collaborative anomaly detection for devices with limited resources. CIoTA uses blockchain to incrementally update a trusted anomaly detection model via self-attestation and consensus among IoT devices. We evaluate CIoTA on our own distributed IoT simulation platform, which consists of 48 Raspberry Pis, to demonstrate CIoTA's ability to enhance the security of each device and the security of the network as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Stealth address prevents public association of a blockchain transaction's output with a recipient's wallet address and hides the actual destination address of a transaction. While stealth address provides an effective privacy-enhancing technology for a cryptocurrency network, it requires blockchain nodes to actively monitor all the transactions and compute the purported destination addresses, which restricts its application for resource-constrained environments like Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose DKSAP-IoT, a faster dual-key stealth address protocol for blockchain-based IoT systems. DKSAP-IoT utilizes a technique similar to the TLS session resumption to improve the performance and reduce the transaction size at the same time between two communication peers. Our theoretical analysis as well as the extensive experiments on an embedded computing platform demonstrate that DKSAP-IoT is able to reduce the computational overhead by at least 50% when compared to the state-of-the-art scheme, thereby paving the way for its application to blockchain-based IoT systems.",

However, most of the time our defending mechanisms to such kind of attacks are carried out individually and independently, which leads to ineffective and weak defense. To this end, we propose to leverage Software Defined Networks (SDN) to enable cooperative security for legacy IP-based IoT devices. SDN decouples control plane and data plane, and can help bridge the knowledge divided between the application and network layers. In this paper, we discuss the IoT security problems and challenges, and present an SDN-based architecture to enable IoT security in a cooperative manner. Furthermore, we implemented a platform that can quickly share the attacking information with peer controllers and block the attacks. We carried out our experiments in both virtual and physical SDN environments with OpenFlow switches. Our evaluation results show that both environments can scale well to handle attacks, but hardware implementation is much more efficient than a virtual one.",

Comparing with the malware propagation control scheme in traditional wireless networks where nodes can be directly repaired and secured, in IoT, compromised end devices are difficult to be patched. Alternatively, blocking malware via patching intermediate nodes turns out to be a more feasible and practical solution. Specifically, patching intermediate nodes can effectively prevent the proliferation of malware propagation by securing infrastructure links and limiting malware propagation to local device-to-device dissemination. This article proposes a novel traffic-aware patching scheme to select important intermediate nodes to patch, which applies to the IoT system with limited patching resources and response time constraint. Experiments on real-world trace datasets in IoT networks are conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed traffic-aware patching scheme in alleviating malware propagation.",

To enable this, in future IoT networks, besides the conventional data access points (DAPs) responsible for collecting data from IoT devices, energy access points (EAPs) should be deployed to transfer radio frequency (RF) energy to IoT devices to maintain their sustainable operations. In practice, the DAPs and EAPs may be operated by different operators and a DAP should provide certain incentives to motivate the surrounding EAPs to charge its associated IoT device(s) to assist its data collection. Motivated by this, in this paper we develop a contract theory-based incentive mechanism for the energy trading in RFEH assisted IoT systems. The necessary and sufficient condition for the feasibility of the formulated contract is analyzed. The optimal contract is derived to maximize the DAP's expected utility as well as the social welfare.

As a solution to this, semantic approaches have been proposed in the literature to tackle problems related to interoperability of sensor data. Several ontologies have been proposed to handle different aspects of IoT-based sensor data collection, ranging from discovering the IoT sensors for data collection to applying reasoning on the collected sensor data for drawing inferences. In this paper, we survey these existing semantic ontologies to provide an overview of the recent developments in this field. We highlight the fundamental ontological concepts (e.g., sensor-capabilities and context-awareness) required for an IoT-based application, and survey the existing ontologies which include these concepts.

This article discusses the challenges facing the support of IoTs through 5G systems. The focus is devoted to discussing physical layer limitations in terms of spectrum resources and radio access channel connectivity. We show how sparsity can be exploited for addressing these challenges especially in terms of enabling wideband spectrum management and handling the connectivity by exploiting device-to-device communications and edge-cloud.

From our study, we show the benefits and challenges that UL IoT UDNs will bring about in the future. In more detail, for a low-reliability criterion, such as achieving a UL signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) above 0 dB, the density of reliably working UEs grows quickly with the network densification, showing the potential of UL IoT UDNs. In contrast, for a high-reliability criterion, such as achieving a UL SINR above 10 dB, the density of reliably working UEs remains to be low in UDNs due to excessive inter-cell interference, which should be considered when operating UL IoT UDNs. Moreover, considering the existence of a non-zero antenna height difference between base stations (BSs) and UEs, the density of reliably working UEs could even decrease as we deploy more BSs. This calls for the usage of sophisticated interference management schemes and/or beam steering/shaping technologies in UL IoT UDNs.",

In this paper, we examine the structure of public IoT data and discover that the majority exhibit unique flat, wide and numerical characteristics with a mix of evenly and unevenly-spaced time-series. We investigate the advances in time-series databases for telemetry data and combine these findings with microbenchmarks to determine the best compression techniques and storage data structures to inform the design of a novel solution optimised for IoT data. A query translation method with low overhead even on resource-constrained Things allows us to utilise rich data models like the Resource Description Framework (RDF) for interoperability and data integration on top of the optimised storage. Our solution, TritanDB, shows an order of magnitude performance improvement across both Things and cloud hardware on many state-of-the-art databases within IoT scenarios.

However, existing schemes can hardly satisfy the distributed coordination within fog computing nodes in the smart grid. In the proposed model, we introduce a new distributed fog computing coordinator, which periodically gathers information of fog computing nodes, e.g., remaining resources, tasks, etc. Moreover, the fog computing coordinator also manages jobs so that all computing nodes can collaborate on complex tasks. In addition, we construct a working prototype of intelligent electric vehicle service to evaluate the proposed model.

In this context, the novel concept of fog computing as well as the combined fog-to-cloud computing paradigm is becoming essential to decentralize the cloud, while bringing the services closer to the end-system. This paper surveys on the application layer communication protocols to fulfil the IoT communication requirements, and their potential for implementation in fog- and cloud-based IoT systems. To this end, the paper first presents a comparative analysis of the main characteristics of IoT communication protocols, including request-reply and publish-subscribe protocols. After that, the paper surveys the protocols that are widely adopted and implemented in each segment of the system (IoT, fog, cloud), and thus opens up the discussion on their interoperability and wider system integration. Finally, the paper reviews the main performance issues, including latency, energy consumption and network throughput. The survey is expected to be useful to system architects and protocol designers when choosing the communication protocols in an integrated IoT-to-fog-to-cloud system architecture.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are connecting to the Internet, yet many of these devices are fundamentally insecure, exposing the Internet to a variety of attacks. Botnets such as Mirai have used insecure consumer IoT devices to conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on critical Internet infrastructure. This motivates the development of new techniques to automatically detect consumer IoT attack traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that using IoT-specific network behaviors (e.g. limited number of endpoints and regular time intervals between packets) to inform feature selection can result in high accuracy DDoS detection in IoT network traffic with a variety of machine learning algorithms, including neural networks. These results indicate that home gateway routers or other network middleboxes could automatically detect local IoT device sources of DDoS attacks using low-cost machine learning algorithms and traffic data that is flow-based and protocol-agnostic.",

These applications are characterized by massive connections from a large number of low-complexity and low-power devices. One of the goals of NB-IoT is to improve coverage extension beyond existing cellular technologies. In order to do that, NB-IoT introduces transmission repetitions and different bandwidth allocation configurations in uplink. These new transmission approaches yield many transmission options in uplink. In this paper, we propose analytical expressions that describe the influence of these new approaches in the transmission. Our analysis is based on the Shannon theorem. The transmission is studied in terms of the required Signal to Noise Ratio, bandwidth utilization, and energy per transmitted bit. Additionally, we propose an uplink link adaptation algorithm that contemplates these new transmission approaches. The conducted evaluation summarizes the influence of these approaches. Furthermore, we present the resulting uplink link adaptation from our proposed algorithm sweeping the device's coverage.",

Combining IoT with a serverless architectural design can be effective when trying to make use of the local processing power that exists in a local network of IoT devices and creating a fog layer that leverages computational capabilities that are closer to the end-user. In this approach, which is placed between the device and the serverless function, when a device requests for the execution of a serverless function will decide based on previous metrics of execution if the serverless function should be executed locally, in the fog layer of a local network of IoT devices, or if it should be executed remotely, in one of the available cloud servers. Therefore, this approach allows to dynamically allocating functions to the most suitable layer.",

For that purpose, in this paper, a novel IoT honeypot called ThingPot is proposed and deployed. Honeypot technology mimics devices that might be exploited by attackers and logs their behavior to detect and analyze the used attack vectors. ThingPot is the first of its kind, since it focuses not only on the IoT application protocols themselves, but on the whole IoT platform. A Proof-of-Concept is implemented with XMPP and a REST API, to mimic a Philips Hue smart lighting system. ThingPot has been deployed for 1.5 months and through the captured data we have found five types of attacks and attack vectors against smart devices.

The rapid development of various communication protocols and miniaturization of transceivers along with recent advances in sensing technologies offer the opportunity to transform isolated devices into communicating smart things. Smart things, that can sense, store, and even process electrical, thermal, optical, chemical, and other signals to extract user-/environment-related information, have enabled services only limited by human imagination. Despite picturesque promises of IoT-enabled systems, the integration of smart things into the standard Internet introduces several security challenges because the majority of Internet technologies, communication protocols, and sensors were not designed to support IoT. Several recent research studies have demonstrated that launching security/privacy attacks against IoT-enabled systems, in particular wearable medical sensor (WMS)-based systems, may lead to catastrophic situations and life-threatening conditions. Therefore, security threats and privacy concerns in the IoT domain need to be proactively studied and aggressively addressed. In this thesis, we tackle several domain-specific security/privacy challenges associated with IoT-enabled systems.",

Finally, we analyze the performance of FAFC scheduling algorithm considering the impacts of the receiver number, the transmitting power and the charging time. Based on the analysis, we summarize the methods of improving the WPT performance for multiple IoT devices, which include limiting the receiver number, increasing the transmitting power, prolonging the charging time and improving the single-user's charging efficiency.

However, there are still many security challenges influencing the further development of IoT, one of which is how to quickly verify the big data obtained from IoT terminals. Aggregate signature is an efficient approach to perform big data authentication. It can effectively reduce the computation and communication overheads. In this paper, utilizing these features, we construct a verifiable data aggregation scheme for Internet of Things, named VDAS, based on an improved certificateless aggregate signature algorithm. In VDAS, the length of the aggregated authentication message is independent of the number of IoT terminals. Then, we prove that VDAS is existentially unforgeable under adaptive chosen message attacks assuming that the computational Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Additionally, the proposed VDAS achieves a better trade-off on the computation overheads between the resource-constrained IoT terminals and the data center.",

    "abstract": "For the Internet of Things (IoT), there might be a large number of devices to be connected to the Internet through wireless technologies. In general, IoT devices would have various constraints due to limited processing capability, memory, energy source, and so on, and it is desirable to employ efficient wireless transmission schemes, especially for uplink transmissions. For example, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with index modulation (IM) or OFDM-IM can be considered for IoT devices due to its energy efficiency. In this paper, we study a different IM scheme for a single-carrier (SC) system, which is referred to as SCIM. While SCIM is similar to OFDM-IM in terms of energy efficiency, SCIM may be better suited for IoT uplink because it has a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and does not require inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT) at devices compared to OFDM-IM. We also consider precoding for SCIM and generalize it to multiple access channel so that multiple IoT devices can share the same radio resource block. To detect precoded SCIM signals, low-complexity detectors are derived. For a better performance, based on variational inference that is widely used in machine learning, we consider a detector that provides an approximate solution to an optimal detection.",

Learning is here used to improve both the IoT network capability to support a larger number of objects as well as the autonomy of IoT devices. We first illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in a proof-of-concept based on USRP software radio platforms operating on real radio signals. It shows how collisions with other RF signals present in the ISM band are diminished for a given IoT device. Then we describe the first implementation of learning algorithms on LoRa devices operating in a real LoRaWAN network, that we named IoTligent. The proposed solution adds neither processing overhead so that it can be ran in the IoT devices, nor network overhead so that no change is required to LoRaWAN. Real life experiments have been done in a realistic LoRa network and they show that IoTligent device battery life can be extended by a factor 2 in the scenarios we faced during our experiment.",

In this research, we present EDIMA, a distributed modular solution which can be used towards the detection of IoT malware network activity in large-scale networks (e.g. ISP, enterprise networks) during the scanning/infecting phase rather than during an attack. EDIMA employs machine learning algorithms for edge devices' traffic classification, a packet traffic feature vector database, a policy module and an optional packet sub-sampling module.

Such devices can be deployed in a laboratory or `in the wild' in natural environments.

Using IoT devices in ordinary environments also brings the benefits of reduced cost, as compared with lab experiments, and less disturbance to the participants' daily routines which in turn helps with recruiting them into the research. However, in this case, it is essential to have an IoT infrastructure that can be easily and swiftly installed and from which real-time data can be securely and straightforwardly collected. In this paper, we present MakeSense, an IoT testbed that enables real-world experimentation for large scale social research on indoor activities through real-time monitoring and/or situation-aware applications. The testbed features quick setup, flexibility in deployment, the integration of a range of IoT devices, resilience, and scalability.

    "abstract": "An increasing number of low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices will be widely deployed in the near future. Considering the short-range communication of low-power devices, multi-hop transmissions will become an important transmission mechanism in IoT networks. It is crucial for lowpower devices to transmit data over long distances via multihop in a low-delay and reliable way. Small-world characteristics of networks indicate that the network has an advantage of a small Average Shortest-path Length (ASL) and a high Average Clustering Coefficient (ACC). In this paper, a new IoT routing mechanism considering small-world characteristics is proposed to reduce the delay and improve the reliability. The ASL and ACC are derived for performance analysis of small-world characteristics in IoT networks based on Cayley graphs. Besides, the reliability and delay models are proposed for Small-World IoT based on Cayley grapHs (SWITCH). Simulation results demonstrate that SWITCH has lower delay and better reliability than that of conventional Nearest Neighboring Routing (NNR). Moreover, the maximum delay of SWITCH is reduced by 50.6% compared with that by NNR.",

Similar to device-based localization, the initial phase in DFL is to build the fingerprint database which is usually done manually using site surveying. This process is tedious, time-consuming, and vulnerable to environmental dynamics. Motivated by the recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), this paper introduces RadioGrapher; a system that automates the process of device-free fingerprint calibration in IoT environments. RadioGrapher leverages the device-based locations of entities in the area of interest in a crowd-sensing manner, aided with Fresnel zones of the wirelessly connected IoT devices to automatically construct a device-free fingerprint. Experimental evaluation of RadioGrapher in an IoT testbed using multiple entities shows that it can construct DFL fingerprints with high accuracy. Moreover, its median localization accuracy is comparable to that of manual fingerprinting. This comes with no calibration overhead, highlighting the promise of RadioGrapher as a crowdsourcing device-free fingerprint constructor in IoT environments.",

Here, we develop a blockchain based Trust and Reputation System (TRS) for IoT access control, which progressively evaluates and calculates the trust and reputation score of each participating node to achieve a self-adaptive and trustworthy access control system. Trust and reputation are explicitly incorporated in the attribute-based access control policy, so that different nodes can be assigned to different access right levels, resulting in dynamic access control policies.

Blockchain (BC), a distributed ledger technology used in cryptocurrency has attracted significant attention in the realm of IoT security and privacy. However, adopting BC to IoT is not straightforward in most cases, due to overheads and delays caused by BC operations. In this paper, we apply a BC technology known as Hyperledgder Fabric, to an IoT network. This technology introduces an execute-order technique for transactions that separates the transaction execution from consensus, resulting in increased efficiency. We demonstrate that our proposed IoT-BC architecture is sufficiently secure with regard to fundamental security goals i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, the simulation results are highlighted that shows the performance overheads associated with our approach are as minimal as those associated with the Hyperledger Fabric framework and negligible in terms of security and privacy.",

This paper concentrates on the design and analysis of age-oriented random access for massive IoT networks. Specifically, we devise a new stationary threshold-based age-dependent random access (ADRA) protocol, in which each IoT device accesses the channel with a certain probability only when its instantaneous AoI exceeds a predetermined threshold. We manage to evaluate the average AoI of the proposed ADRA protocol mathematically by decoupling the tangled AoI evolution of multiple IoT devices and modeling the decoupled AoI evolution of each device as a Discrete-Time Markov Chain.

Two community detection algorithms, namely Louvain and order statistics local method (OSLOM) algorithms, are investigated and applied to a real-world IoT dataset to form non-overlapping and overlapping IoT devices groups. Afterwards, a natural language process (NLP)-based approach is executed to handle crowdsourcing textual requests and accordingly find the list of IoT devices capable of effectively accomplishing the tasks. This is performed by matching the NLP outputs, e.g., type of application, location, required trustworthiness level, with the different detected communities.

To let end users take back the control of smart homes, we propose Sovereign, an IoT system framework that allows users to securely control home IoT systems without depending on a cloud backend. Unlike existing solutions, Sovereign networks home IoT devices and applications using named data with application-level semantics; the names are then used to construct security mechanisms. Users define security policies and these policies are then executed by the localized security modules. We implement Sovereign as a pub/sub based development platform together with a prototype local IoT controller. Our preliminary evaluation shows that Sovereign provides an easy-to-use systematic solution to secure smart homes under user control without imposing noticeable overhead.",

Internet-related activities based on the IoT services can inevitably generate a lot of real-time data which leads a big data phenomenon. To efficiently handle such big IoT data, software-defined networking (SDN) techniques could come into play. Among SDN techniques, P4 is a highlevel language for programming protocol-independent packet processors. This paper presents our preliminary work on how we can use P4 to achieve flexible datapath programming for large scale IoT streaming data streaming. As a case study, we describe the implementation of dynamic MST-based datapath programing for IoT data collection in an arbitrary network topology.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) has brought along immense benefits to our daily lives encompassing a diverse range of application domains that we regularly interact with, ranging from healthcare automation to transport and smart environments. However, due to the limitation of constrained resources and computational capabilities, IoT networks are prone to various cyber attacks. Thus, defending the IoT network against adversarial attacks is of vital importance. In this paper, we present a novel intrusion detection approach for IoT networks through the application of a deep learning technique. We adopt a cutting-edge IoT dataset comprising IoT traces and realistic attack traffic, including denial of service, distributed denial of service, reconnaissance and information theft attacks. We utilise the header field information in individual packets as generic features to capture general network behaviours, and develop a feed-forward neural networks model with embedding layers (to encode high-dimensional categorical features) for multi-class classification. The concept of transfer learning is subsequently adopted to encode high-dimensional categorical features to build a binary classifier. Results obtained through the evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrate a high classification accuracy for both binary and multi-class classifiers.",

In this paper, we revisit the generation of randomness from the perspective of an IoT operating system (OS) that needs to support general purpose or crypto-secure random numbers. We analyse the potential attack surface, derive common requirements, and discuss the potentials and shortcomings of current IoT OSs. A systematic evaluation of current IoT hardware components and popular software generators based on well-established test suits and on experiments for measuring performance give rise to a set of clear recommendations on how to build such a random subsystem and which generators to use.",

For sensing, highly accurate sensed information at IoT devices are sent to the base station (BS) by using non-orthogonal communication over wireless multiple access channels. Meanwhile, for computation, a novel technique, namely over-the-air computation (AirComp), is adopted to substantially reduce the latency of massive data aggregation via exploiting the superposition property of wireless multiple access channels. To coordinate the co-channel interference for enhancing the overall performance of B5G cellular IoT integrating SCC, two joint beamforming design algorithms are proposed from the perspectives of the computation error minimization and the weighted sum-rate maximization, respectively. Finally, extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for B5G cellular IoT over the baseline ones.",

Multiple IoT device manufacturers do not consider securing the devices they produce for different reasons like cost reduction or to avoid using energy-harvesting components. Such potentially malicious devices might be exploited by the adversary to do multiple harmful attacks. Therefore, we developed a system that can recognize malicious behavior of a specific IoT node on the network. Through convolutional neural network and monitoring, we were able to provide malware detection for IoT using a central node that can be installed within the network.

In this paper, we formulate a distributed mechanism to analyze the interaction between OSPs and IoT MDs in the MEC enabled edge-cloud system by appling multi-leader multi-follower two-tier Stackelberg game theory. We first prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium, and then we propose two distributed algorithms, namely iterative proximal offloading algorithm (IPOA) and iterative Stackelberg game pricing algorithm (ISPA). The IPOA solves the follower non-cooperative game among IoT MDs and ISPA uses backward induction to deal with the price competition among OSPs. Experimental results show that IPOA can markedly reduce the disutility of IoT MDs compared with other traditional task offloading schemes and the price of anarchy is always less than 150\\%. Besides, results also demonstrate that ISPA is reliable in boosting the revenue of OSPs.",

In this article, we evaluate a representative sample of these platforms, both proprietary and open-source, on the basis of their ability to meet the expectations of different IoT users.

Software-defined networking (SDN) technology, a new paradigm in the networking area, can be useful in creating an IoT because it can handle interactivity by controlling physical devices, transmission of data among them, and data acquisition. However, digital signage can be one of the promising technologies in this era of technology that is progressing toward the interactive world, connecting users to the IoT network through device-to-device communication technology. This article illustrates a novel prototype that is mainly focused on a smart digital signage system comprised of software-defined IoT (SD-IoT) and invisible image sensor communication technology. We have proposed an SDN scheme with a view to initiating its flexibility and compatibility for an IoT network-based smart digital signage system. The idea of invisible communication can make the users of the technology trendier to it, and the usage of unused resources such as images and videos can be ensured. In addition, this communication has paved the way for interactivity between the user and digital signage, where the digital signage and the camera of a smartphone can be operated as a transmitter and a receiver, respectively. The proposed scheme might be applicable to real-world applications because SDN has the flexibility to adapt with the alteration of network status without any hardware modifications while displays and smartphones are available everywhere. A performance analysis of this system showed the advantages of an SD-IoT network over an Internet protocol-based IoT network considering a queuing analysis for a dynamic link allocation process in the case of user access to the IoT network.",

While leveraging the large-scale IoT-based applications like Smart Gird and Smart Cities, IoT also incurs more concerns on privacy and security. Among the top security challenges that IoTs face is that access authorization is critical in resource and information protection over IoTs. Traditional access control approaches, like Access Control Lists (ACL), Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), are not able to provide a scalable, manageable and efficient mechanisms to meet requirement of IoT systems. The extraordinary large number of nodes, heterogeneity as well as dynamicity, necessitate more fine-grained, lightweight mechanisms for IoT devices. In this paper, a federated capability-based access control (FedCAC) framework is proposed to enable an effective access control processes to devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems. An identity-based capability token management strategy is presented, which involves registering, propagation and revocation of the access authorization. Through delegating centralized authorization decision-making policy to local domain delegator, the access authorization process is locally conducted on the service provider that integrates situational awareness (SAW) and customized contextual conditions. Implemented and tested on both resources-constrained devices, like smart sensors and Raspberry PI, and non-resource-constrained devices, like laptops and smart phones, our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed FedCAC approach to offer a scalable, lightweight and fine-grained access control solution to IoT systems connected to a system network.",

    "abstract": "The emerging Internet of Things (IoT)-driven ultra-dense small cell networks (UD-SCNs) will need to combat a variety of challenges. On one hand, massive number of devices sharing the limited wireless resources will render centralized control mechanisms infeasible due to the excessive cost of information acquisition and computations. On the other hand, to reduce energy consumption from fixed power grid and/or battery, many IoT devices may need to depend on the energy harvested from the ambient environment (e.g., from RF transmissions, environmental sources). However, due to the opportunistic nature of energy harvesting, this will introduce uncertainty in the network operation. In this article, we study the distributed cell association problem for energy harvesting IoT devices in UD-SCNs. After reviewing the state-of-the-art research on the cell association problem in small cell networks, we outline the major challenges for distributed cell association in IoT-driven UD-SCNs where the IoT devices will need to perform cell association in a distributed manner in presence of uncertainty (e.g., limited knowledge on channel/network) and limited computational capabilities. To this end, we propose an approach based on mean-field multi-armed bandit games to solve the uplink cell association problem for energy harvesting IoT devices in a UD-SCN. This approach is particularly suitable to analyze large multi-agent systems under uncertainty and lack of information. We provide some theoretical results as well as preliminary performance evaluation results for the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "IoT is considered as one of the key enabling technologies for the fourth industrial revolution, that is known as Industry 4.0. In this paper, we consider the mechatronic component as the lowest level in the system composition hierarchy that tightly integrates mechanics with the electronics and software required to convert the mechanics to intelligent (smart) object offering well defined services to its environment. For this mechatronic component to be integrated in the IoT-based industrial automation environment, a software layer is required on top of it to convert its conventional interface to an IoT compliant one. This layer, that we call IoTwrapper, transforms the conventional mechatronic component to an Industrial Automation Thing (IAT). The IAT is the key element of an IoT model specifically developed in the context of this work for the manufacturing domain. The model is compared to existing IoT models and its main differences are discussed. A model-to-model transformer is presented to automatically transform the legacy mechatronic component to an IAT ready to be integrated in the IoT-based industrial automation environment. The UML4IoT profile is used in the form of a Domain Specific Modeling Language to automate this transformation. A prototype implementation of an Industrial Automation Thing using C and the Contiki operating system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing fast adoption in the society, from industrial to home applications. The number of deployed sensors and connected devices to the Internet is changing our perspective and the way we understand the world. The development and generation of IoT applications is just starting and they will modify our physical and virtual lives, from how we control remotely appliances at home to how we deal with insurance companies in order to start insurance schemes via smart cards. This massive deployment of IoT devices represents a tremendous economic impact and at the same time offers multiple opportunities. However, the potential of IoT is underexploited and day by day this gap between devices and useful applications is getting bigger. Additionally, the physical and cyber worlds are largely disconnected, requiring a lot of manual efforts to integrate, find, and use information in a meaningful way. To build a connection between the physical and the virtual, we need a knowledge framework that allow bilateral understandings, devices producing data, information systems managing the data and applications transforming information into meaningful knowledge. The first column in this series in the previous issue of this magazine titled \"Internet of Things to Smart IoT Through Semantic, Cognitive, and Perceptual Computing,\" reviews IoT growth and potential that have energized research and technology development, centered on aspects of Artificial Intelligence to build future intelligent system. This column steps back and demonstrates the benefits of using semantic web technologies to get meaningful knowledge from sensor data to design smart systems.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is large-scale by nature. This is not only manifested by the large number of connected devices, but also by the high volumes of traffic that must be accommodated. Cellular networks are indeed a natural candidate for the data tsunami the IoT is expected to generate in conjunction with legacy human-type traffic. However, the random access process for scheduling request represents a major bottleneck to support IoT via LTE cellular networks. Accordingly, this paper develops a mathematical framework to model and study the random access channel (RACH) scalability to accommodate IoT traffic. The developed model is based on stochastic geometry and discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) to account for different access strategies and possible sources of inter-cell and intra-cell interferences. To this end, the developed model is utilized to assess and compare three different access strategies, which incorporate a combination of transmission persistency, back-off, and power ramping. The analysis and the results showcased herewith clearly illustrate the vulnerability of the random access procedure as the IoT intensity grows. Finally, the paper offers insights into effective scenarios for each transmission strategy in terms of IoT intensity and RACH detection thresholds.",

Conventional security and privacy approaches tend to be inapplicable for IoT, mainly due to its decentralized topology and the resource-constraints of the majority of its devices. BlockChain BC that underpin the crypto-currency Bitcoin have been recently used to provide security and privacy in peer-to-peer networks with similar topologies to IoT. However, BCs are computationally expensive and involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not suitable for IoT devices. This position paper proposes a new secure, private, and lightweight architecture for IoT, based on BC technology that eliminates the overhead of BC while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits. The described method is investigated on a smart home application as a representative case study for broader IoT applications. The proposed architecture is hierarchical, and consists of smart homes, an overlay network and cloud storages coordinating data transactions with BC to provide privacy and security. Our design uses different types of BCs depending on where in the network hierarchy a transaction occurs, and uses distributed trust methods to ensure a decentralized topology. Qualitative evaluation of the architecture under common threat models highlights its effectiveness in providing security and privacy for IoT applications.",

NB-IoT is designed to provide better indoor coverage, support of a massive number of low-throughput devices, with relaxed delay requirements, and lower-energy consumption. NB-IoT reuses Long Term Evolution functionality with simplifications and optimizations. Particularly for small data transmissions, NB-IoT specifies two procedures to reduce the required signaling: one of them based on the Control Plane (CP), and the other on the User Plane (UP). In this work, we provide an overview of these procedures as well as an evaluation of their performance. The results of the energy consumption show both optimizations achieve a battery lifetime extension of more than 2 years for a large range in the considered cases, and up to 8 years for CP with good coverage. In terms of cell capacity relative to SR, CP achieves gains from 26% to 224%, and UP ranges from 36% to 165%. The comparison of CP and UP optimizations yields similar results, except for some specific configurations.",

Our design uses open web standards and evolving network protocols, Cloud and edge resources, and streaming Big Data platforms. We motivate our design requirements using the smart water management domain; some of these requirements are unique to developing nations. We also validate the architecture within a campus-scale IoT testbed at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, and present our experiences. Our architecture is scalable to a township or city, while also generalizable to other Smart Utility domains. Our experiences serves as a template for other similar efforts, particularly in emerging markets, and highlights the gaps and opportunities for a data-driven IoT Software architecture for smart cities.",

The primary goal of a Smart City is to counteract these problems and mitigate their effects by means of modern ICT to improve urban administration and infrastructure. Key ideas are to utilise network communication to inter-connect public authorities; but also to deploy and integrate numerous sensors and actuators throughout the city infrastructure - which is also widely known as the Internet of Things (IoT).

We first examine a number of IoT platforms, technologies and network standards that can help to foster a Smart City environment. Second, we introduce the EU project MONICA which aims for demonstration of large-scale IoT deployments at public, inner-city events and give an overview on its IoT platform architecture.

This underscores the cardinal role of IoT on the journey towards the fifth generation (5G) of wireless communication systems. IoT technologies augmented with intelligent and big data analytics are expected to rapidly change the landscape of myriads of application domains ranging from health care to smart cities and industrial automations. The emergence of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) technology aims at extending cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the radio access network, hence providing real-time, high-bandwidth, low-latency access to radio network resources. IoT is identified as a key use case of MEC, given MEC's ability to provide cloud platform and gateway services at the network edge. MEC will inspire the development of myriads of applications and services with demand for ultra low latency and high Quality of Service (QoS) due to its dense geographical distribution and wide support for mobility. MEC is therefore an important enabler of IoT applications and services which require real-time operations. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview on the exploitation of MEC technology for the realization of IoT applications and their synergies. We further discuss the technical aspects of enabling MEC in IoT and provide some insight into various other integration technologies therein.",

This disjunction makes the state-of-art deep learning algorithms, i.e. CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), incompatible with IoT world. We present a low-bit (range from 8-bit to 1-bit) scheme with our local quantization region algorithm. We use models in Caffe model zoo as our example tasks to evaluate the effect of our low precision data representation scheme. With the available of local quantization region, we find implementations on top of those schemes could greatly retain the model accuracy, besides the reduction of computational complexity. For example, our 8-bit scheme has no drops on top-1 and top-5 accuracy with 2x speedup on Intel Edison IoT platform. Implementations based on our 4-bit, 2-bit or 1-bit scheme are also applicable to IoT devices with advances of low computational complexity. For example, the drop on our task is only 0.7% when using 2-bit scheme, a scheme which could largely save transistors. Making low-bit scheme usable here opens a new door for further optimization on commodity IoT controller, i.e. extra speed-up could be achieved by replacing multiply-accumulate operations with the proposed table look-up operations. The whole study offers a new approach to relief the challenge of bring advanced deep learning algorithm to resource constrained low-cost IoT device.",

    "abstract": "In light of the quick proliferation of Internet of things (IoT) devices and applications, fog radio access network (Fog-RAN) has been recently proposed for fifth generation (5G) wireless communications to assure the requirements of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for the IoT applications which cannot accommodate large delays. Hence, fog nodes (FNs) are equipped with computing, signal processing and storage capabilities to extend the inherent operations and services of the cloud to the edge. We consider the problem of sequentially allocating the FN's limited resources to the IoT applications of heterogeneous latency requirements. For each access request from an IoT user, the FN needs to decide whether to serve it locally utilizing its own resources or to refer it to the cloud to conserve its valuable resources for future users of potentially higher utility to the system (i.e., lower latency requirement). We formulate the Fog-RAN resource allocation problem in the form of a Markov decision process (MDP), and employ several reinforcement learning (RL) methods, namely Q-learning, SARSA, Expected SARSA, and Monte Carlo, for solving the MDP problem by learning the optimum decision-making policies. We verify the performance and adaptivity of the RL methods and compare it with the performance of a fixed-threshold-based algorithm. Extensive simulation results considering 19 IoT environments of heterogeneous latency requirements corroborate that RL methods always achieve the best possible performance regardless of the IoT environment.",

We evaluate SainT on 230 SmartThings market apps and find 138 (60%) include sensitive data flows. In addition, we demonstrate SainT on IoTBench, a novel open-source test suite containing 19 apps with 27 unique data leaks.

We illustrate our approach through a Building Management System, using well-known IoT devices running the Contiki OS that communicate by diverse IoT protocols (e.g. CoAP, MQTT). The results allow to derive tight bounds for the energy consumption in various device functionalities, as well as to validate lifetime requirements through Statistical Model Checking.",

However, the existing Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) scheme in NB-IoT cannot provide connectivity for a massive number of MTC devices. In parallel with the development of NB-IoT, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), introduced for the fifth generation wireless networks, is deemed to significantly improve the network capacity by providing massive connectivity through sharing the same spectral resources. To leverage NOMA in the context of NB-IoT, we propose a power domain NOMA scheme with user clustering for an NB-IoT system. In particular, the MTC devices are assigned to different ranks within the NOMA clusters where they transmit over the same frequency resources. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the total throughput of the network by optimizing the resource allocation of MTC devices and NOMA clustering while satisfying the transmission power and quality of service requirements. We prove the NP-hardness of the proposed optimization problem. We further design an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem by jointly optimizing NOMA clustering and resource allocation of MTC devices. Furthermore, we prove that the reduced optimization problem of power control is a convex optimization task. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

We propose an automatic IoT device classification method to identify new and unseen devices. The method uses the rich information carried by the traffic flows of IoT networks to characterize the attributes of various devices. We first specify a set of discriminating features from raw network traffic flows, and then propose a LSTM-CNN cascade model to automatically identify the semantic type of a device. Our experimental results using a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that our proposed method is capable of delivering satisfactory performance.

    "abstract": "A large number of IoT devices are connected via the Internet. However, most of these IoT devices are generally not perfect-by-design even have security weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Thus, it is essential to update these IoT devices securely, patching their vulnerabilities and protecting the safety of the involved users. Existing studies deliver secure and reliable updates based on blockchain network which serves as the transmission network. However, these approaches could compromise users privacy when updating the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain based privacy-preserving software updates protocol, which delivers secure and reliable updates with an incentive mechanism, as well protects the privacy of involved users. The vendor delivers the updates and it makes a commitment by using a smart contract to provide financial incentive to the transmission nodes who deliver the updates to the IoT devices. A transmission node gets financial incentive by providing a proof-of-delivery. The transmission node uses double authentication preventing signature (DAPS) to carry out the fair exchange to obtain the proof-of-delivery. Specifically, the transmission node exchanges an attribute-based signature from a IoT device by using DAPS. Then, it uses the attribute-based signature as a proof-of-delivery to receive financial incentives. Generally, the IoT device has to execute complex computation for an attribute-based signature (ABS). It is intolerable for resource limited devices. We propose a concrete outsourced attribute-based signature (OABS) scheme to resist the weakness. Then, we prove the security of the proposed OABS and the protocol as well. Finally, we implement smart contract in Solidity to demonstrate the validity of the proposed protocol.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores an emerging wireless Internet-of-things (IoT) architecture based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We consider a network where a fleet of UAVs at a fixed altitude flies on planned trajectories and IoT devices on the ground are scheduled to transmit their data to the UAVs when the latter are nearby. In such a system, the UAVs' motion triggers the uplink transmissions of the IoT devices. As a result, network performance is determined by the geometric and dynamic characteristics of the system. We propose a joint stationary model for UAVs and IoT devices and then evaluate the interference, the coverage probability, and the data rate of the typical UAV. To assess the harvesting capability of the proposed architecture, we derive a formula for the amount of data uploaded from each IoT device to a UAV. We also establish a linear relationship between the UAV coverage and the harvesting capability of the network, which provides insights into the design of the proposed harvesting scheme. In addition, we use our analytical results to numerically show that there exists a trade-off between the uploaded data and the size of the IoT scheduling window. Specifically, for a given UAV and IoT geometry, there exists an optimal scheduling window that maximizes the harvesting capability of the proposed network.",

The IoT is pervasive and is almost an integral part of our daily life. As devices are becoming increasingly connected, privacy and security issues become more and more critical and these need to be addressed on an urgent basis. IoT implementations and devices are eminently prone to threats that could compromise the security and privacy of the consumers, which, in turn, could influence its practical deployment. In recent past, some research has been carried out to secure IoT devices with an intention to alleviate the security concerns of users. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the security and privacy issues in IoT systems. To this effect, the paper examines the security issues at each layer in the IoT protocol stack, identifies the underlying challenges and key security requirements and provides a brief overview of existing security solutions to safeguard the IoT from the layered context.",

In this paper, we evaluate the impact of demand splitting over heterogeneous processing resources in an IoT platform, supported by Fog and Cloud infrastructure. We develop a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to study the gains of splitting resource intensive demands among IoT nodes, Fog devices and Cloud servers. A surveillance application is considered, which consists of multiple smart cameras capable of capturing and analyzing real-time video streams. The PON access network aggregates IoT layer demands for processing in the Fog, or the Cloud which is accessed through the IP/WDM network. For typical video analysis workloads, the results show that splitting medium demand sizes among IoT and Fog resources yields a total power consumption saving of up to 32%, even if they can host only 10% of the total workload and this can reach 93% for lower number of demands, compared to the centralized cloud solution. However, the gains in power savings from splitting decreases as the number of splits increases. Keywords: IoT surveillance, PON, energy efficiency, fog, distributed processing.",

    "abstract": "In-network caching is a central aspect of Information-Centric Networking (ICN). It enables the rapid distribution of content across the network, alleviating strain on content producers and reducing content delivery latencies. ICN has emerged as a promising candidate for use in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, IoT devices operate under severe constraints, most notably limited memory. This means that nodes cannot indiscriminately cache all content; instead, there is a need for a caching strategy that decides what content to cache. Furthermore, many applications in the IoT space are timesensitive; therefore, finding a caching strategy that minimises the latency between content request and delivery is desirable. In this paper, we evaluate a number of ICN caching strategies in regards to latency and hop count reduction using IoT devices in a physical testbed. We find that the topology of the network, and thus the routing algorithm used to generate forwarding information, has a significant impact on the performance of a given caching strategy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on latency effects in ICN-IoT caching while using real IoT hardware, and the first to explicitly discuss the link between routing algorithm, network topology, and caching effects.",

We first investigate the fundamental statistical properties of an activation signaling process induced by BSs that would like to activate the devices in their cells, which helps to derive the neat expressions of the true, false and total activation probabilities that reveal joint downlink power control and BS coordination is an effective means to significantly improve the activation performance. We then propose an energy-efficient uplink power control for IoT devices which is shown to save power and ameliorate the uplink coverage probability at the same time. We also propose an energy-efficient downlink power control and BS coordination scheme, which is shown to remarkably improve the activation and uplink coverage performances at the same time.",

    "abstract": "The design and development process for Internet of Things (IoT) applications is more complicated than for desktop, mobile, or web applications. IoT applications require both software and hardware to work together across multiple different types of nodes (e.g., microcontrollers, system-on-chips, mobile phones, miniaturised single-board computers, and cloud platforms) with different capabilities under different conditions. IoT applications typically collect and analyse personal data that can be used to derive sensitive information about individuals. Without proper privacy protections in place, IoT applications could lead to serious privacy violations. Thus far, privacy concerns have not been explicitly considered in software engineering processes when designing and developing IoT applications, partly due to a lack of tools, technologies, and guidance. This paper presents a research vision that argues the importance of developing a privacy-aware IoT application design tool to address the challenges mentioned above. This tool should not only transform IoT application designs into privacy-aware application designs but also validate and verify them. First, we outline how this proposed tool should work in practice and its core functionalities. Then, we identify research challenges and potential directions towards developing the proposed tool. We anticipate that this proposed tool will save many engineering hours which engineers would otherwise need to spend on developing privacy expertise and applying it. We also highlight the usefulness of this tool towards privacy education and privacy compliance.",

Some of those challenges are currently being addressed by coupling IoT applications with blockchains. However, current blockchain-backed IoT systems simply use the blockchain to store access control policies, thereby underutilizing the power of blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Sash that couples IoT platforms with blockchain that provides a number of advantages compared to state of the art. In Sash, the blockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control decisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are correctly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a ``data marketplace'' by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle financial transaction and providing ``by design'' remuneration to data producers. Finally, we exploit a special flavor of identity-based encryption to cater for cryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to distribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source IoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end. We also evaluate the performance of our prototype and show that it incurs tolerable overhead in realistic deployment settings.",

However, in the meantime, such a fast-growing technology has also introduced new privacy issues, which need to be better understood and measured. In this work, we look into how private information can be leaked from network traffic generated in the smart home network. Although researchers have proposed techniques to infer IoT device types or user behaviors under clean experiment setup, the effectiveness of such approaches become questionable in the complex but realistic network environment, where common techniques like Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) are enabled. Traffic analysis using traditional methods (e.g., through classical machine-learning models) is much less effective under those settings, as the features picked manually are not distinctive any more. In this work, we propose a traffic analysis framework based on sequence-learning techniques like LSTM and leveraged the temporal relations between packets for the attack of device identification. We evaluated it under different environment settings (e.g., pure-IoT and noisy environment with multiple non-IoT devices). The results showed our framework was able to differentiate device types with a high accuracy. This result suggests IoT network communications pose prominent challenges to users' privacy, even when they are protected by encryption and morphed by the network gateway. As such, new privacy protection methods on IoT traffic need to be developed towards mitigating this new issue.",

Ensuring the security of IoT devices is a high priority due to the sensitive nature of the collected data. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have emerged as critical hardware primitive for ensuring the security of IoT nodes. Malicious modeling of PUF architectures has proven to be difficult due to the inherently stochastic nature of PUF architectures. Extant approaches to malicious PUF modeling assume that a priori knowledge and physical access to the PUF architecture is available for malicious attack on the IoT node. However, many IoT networks make the underlying assumption that the PUF architecture is sufficiently tamper-proof, both physically and mathematically. In this work, we show that knowledge of the underlying PUF structure is not necessary to clone a PUF. We present a novel non-invasive, architecture independent, machine learning attack for strong PUF designs with a cloning accuracy of 93.5% and improvements of up to 48.31% over an alternative, two-stage brute force attack model. We also propose a machine-learning based countermeasure, discriminator, which can distinguish cloned PUF devices and authentic PUFs with an average accuracy of 96.01%. The proposed discriminator can be used for rapidly authenticating millions of IoT nodes remotely from the cloud server.",

IoT objects capable of handling multiple sensing and actuating functions are the cornerstone of smart applications such as smart buildings, smart factories, home automation, and healthcare automation. These smart applications express their demands in terms of high-level requests. These requests are characterised by the different requirements of sensing actuating functions, processing and memory needs, activation zones, latency, etc. In service-oriented architecture-based IoT, application requests are translated into a business process BP workflow. In this study, we model such a BP as a virtual network containing a set of virtual nodes and links connected in a specific topology. These virtual nodes represent the requested processing and location where sensing or actuation are needed. The virtual links capture the requested communication requirements between nodes. In this paper, we introduce a framework, optimised using mixed integer linear programming MILP, that embeds the BPs from the virtual layer into a lower-level implementation at the IoT physical layer. The proposed framework results in a physical plan that optimally allocates the processing needed and provisions the sensing and actuation at the required locations requirements to an appropriate set of IoT nodes. The optimisation goal is to minimise the IoT layer total power consumption and optimise the traffic distribution in a manner that minimises the traffic latency of each IoT node. Our results show that the proposed framework enhances the network performance by reducing the power consumption and latency.",

We evaluate the proposed scheme in terms of its power consumption and data delivery time, and then compare the results with those of recent resilience schemes such as schemes based on redundancy and replication. The proposed framework was optimized using mixed integer linear programming and real-time heuristics were developed, thus embedding a virtual layer into a physical layer based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA). The proposed framework offers different combinations of packet resilience in terms of recovering the lost data by using end- to-end mechanisms.

Connecting everyday physical objects is creating new business models, improving processes and reducing costs and risks. Recently, blockchain technology has received a lot of attention from the community as a possible solution to overcome security issues in IoT. However, traditional blockchains (such as the ones used in Bitcoin and Ethereum) are not well suited to the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices and also with the large volume of information that is expected to be generated from typical IoT deployments. To overcome these issues, several researchers have presented lightweight instances of blockchains tailored for IoT. For example, proposing novel data structures based on blocks with decoupled and appendable data. However, these researchers did not discuss how the consensus algorithm would impact their solutions, i.e., the decision of which consensus algorithm would be better suited was left as an open issue. In this paper, we improved an appendable-block blockchain framework to support different consensus algorithms through a modular design. We evaluated the performance of this improved version in different emulated scenarios and studied the impact of varying the number of devices and transactions and employing different consensus algorithms. Even adopting different consensus algorithms, results indicate that the latency to append a new block is less than 161ms (in the more demanding scenario) and the delay for processing a new transaction is less than 7ms, suggesting that our improved version of the appendable-block blockchain is efficient and scalable, and thus well suited for IoT scenarios.",

The proposed method is based on the AODV routing protocol and is presented under the MTISS-IoT name which means for the reduction of gray hole attacks using check node information.

The method is evaluated here via extensive simulations carried out in the NS-3 environment.

We apply a recently proposed metric, named age of information (AoI), to capture the timeliness of the information delivery. The AoI is defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the most recently received status update. Different from the existing studies that considered either multicast transmission without hard deadlines or unicast transmission with hard deadlines, we enforce a hard deadline for the service time of multicast transmission. This is important for many emerging multicast IoT applications, where the outdated status updates are useless for IoT devices. Specifically, the transmission of a status update is terminated when either the hard deadline expires or a sufficient number of IoT devices successfully receive the status update. We first calculate the distributions of the service time for all possible reception outcomes at IoT devices, and then derive a closed-form expression of the average AoI. Simulations validate the performance analysis, which reveals that: 1) the multicast transmission with hard deadlines achieves a lower average AoI than that without hard deadlines; and 2) there exists an optimal value of the hard deadline that minimizes the average AoI.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the multicast transmission of a real-time Internet of Things (IoT) system, where an access point (AP) transmits time-stamped status updates to multiple IoT devices. Different from the existing studies that only considered multicast transmission without deadlines, we enforce a deadline for the service time of each multicast status update, taking into account both the fixed and randomly distributed deadlines. In particular, a status update is dropped when either its deadline expires or it is successfully received by a certain number of IoT devices. Considering deadlines is important for many emerging IoT applications, where the outdated status updates are of no use to IoT devices. We evaluate the timeliness of the status update delivery by applying a recently proposed metric, named the age of information (AoI), which is defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the most recently received status update. After deriving the distributions of the service time for all possible reception outcomes at IoT devices, we manage to obtain the closed-form expressions of both the average AoI and the average peak AoI. Simulations validate the performance analysis, which reveals that the multicast transmission with deadlines achieves a lower average AoI than that without deadlines and there exists an optimal value of the deadline that can minimize the average (peak) AoI. Results also show that the fixed and random deadlines have respective advantages in different deadline regimes.",

    "abstract": "We present FLIC, a distributed software data caching framework for fogs that reduces network traffic and latency. FLICis targeted toward city-scale deployments of cooperative IoT devices in which each node gathers and shares data with surrounding devices. As machine learning and other data processing techniques that require large volumes of training data are ported to low-cost and low-power IoT systems, we expect that data analysis will be moved away from the cloud. Separation from the cloud will reduce reliance on power-hungry centralized cloud-based infrastructure. However, city-scale deployments of cooperative IoT devices often connect to the Internet with cellular service, in which service charges are proportional to network usage. IoT system architects must be clever in order to keep costs down in these scenarios. To reduce the network bandwidth required to operate city-scale deployments of cooperative IoT systems, FLIC implements a distributed cache on the IoT nodes in the fog. FLIC allows the IoT network to share its data without repetitively interacting with a simple cloud storage service reducing calls out to a backing store. Our results displayed a less than 2% miss rate on reads. Thus, allowing for only 5% of requests needing the backing store. We were also able to achieve more than 50% reduction in bytes transmitted per second.",

    "abstract": "We study a decentralized channel allocation problem in an ad-hoc Internet of Things (IoT) network underlaying on a spectrum licensed to an existing wireless network. In the considered IoT network, the impoverished computation capability and the limited antenna number on the IoT devices make them difficult to acquire the Channel State Information (CSI) for the multi-channels over the shared spectrum. In addition, in practice, the unknown patterns of the licensed users' transmission activities and the time-varying CSI due to fast fading or mobility of the IoT devices can also cause stochastic changes in the channel quality. Therefore, decentralized IoT links are expected to learn their channel statistics online based on the partial observations, while acquiring no information about the channels that they are not operating on. Meanwhile, they also have to reach an efficient, collision-free solution of channel allocation on the basis of limited coordination or message exchange. Our study maps this problem into a contextual multi-player, multi-arm bandit game, for which we propose a purely decentralized, three-stage policy learning algorithm through trial-and-error. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed learning algorithm guarantees the IoT devices to jointly converge to the social-optimal channel allocation with a sub-linear (i.e., polylogarithmic) regret with respect to the operational time. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm strikes a good balance between efficient channel allocation and network scalability when compared with the other state-of-the-art distributed multi-armed bandit algorithms.",

Mobile IoT is composed by mobile IoT devices such as vehicles, wearable devices and smartphones. Owing to the time-varying channel conditions, traffic loads and computing loads, it is challenging to improve the quality of service (QoS) of mobile IoT devices. As task delay consists of both the transmission delay and computing delay, we investigate the resource allocation (i.e., including both radio resource and computation resource) in both the wireless channel and fog node to minimize the delay of all tasks while their QoS constraints are satisfied. We formulate the resource allocation problem into an integer non-linear problem, where both the radio resource and computation resource are taken into account. As IoT tasks are dynamic, the resource allocation for different tasks are coupled with each other and the future information is impractical to be obtained. Therefore, we design an on-line reinforcement learning algorithm to make the sub-optimal decision in real time based on the system's experience replay data. The performance of the designed algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive simulation results.",

Sensors, cameras, and instruments can be combined to provide previously unachievable insights into the state of ongoing experiments.

Indeed, synergizing diverse IoT data streams in near-real time can require the use of machine learning (ML). In addition, new tools and technologies are required to facilitate the collection, aggregation, and manipulation of sensor data in order to simplify the application of ML models and in turn, fully realize the utility of IoT devices in laboratories.

Monitoring this huge number of IoT devices that are heterogeneous in terms of underlying communication protocols and data format is challenging. The majority of existing IoT device monitoring solutions heavily rely on centralized architectures. Since using centralized architectures comes at the expense of trusting an authority, it has several inherent drawbacks, including vulnerability to security attacks, lack of data privacy, and unauthorized data manipulation. Hence, a new decentralized approach is crucial to remedy these drawbacks. One of the most promising technologies which is widely used to provide decentralization is blockchain. Additionally, to ease the burden of communication overhead and computational power on resource-constrained IoT devices, fog computing can be exploited to decrease communication latency and provide better network scalability. In this paper, we propose a scalable blockchain-based architecture for monitoring IoT devices using fog computing. To demonstrate the feasibility and usability of the proposed solution, we have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype, leveraging Ethereum smart contracts. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed solution is significantly scalable and compatible with resource-constrained IoT devices.",

Aiming to deal with such a degree of heterogeneity, several frameworks have applied the Model-Driven Development (MDD) to build IoT applications. On the software architecture viewpoint, the literature has shown that the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a promising style to address the interoperability of entities composing these solutions. Some features of IoT make it challenging to analyze the impact of design decisions on the SOA-based IoT applications behavior. Thus, it is a key requirement to simulate the model to verify whether the system performs as expected before its implementation. Although the literature has identified that the SOA style is suitable for addressing the interoperability, existing modelling languages do not consider SOA elements as first-class citizens when designing IoT applications. Furthermore, although existing MDD frameworks provide modeling languages comprising well-defined syntax, they lack execution semantics, thus, are not suitable for model execution and analysis. This work aims at addressing these issues by introducing IoTDraw. The framework provides a fully OMG-compliant executable modeling language for SOA-based IoT systems; thus, its specifications can be implemented by any tool implementing OMG standards.",

Until now, there has been no systematic mapping study dedicated to the topic of interoperability and integration testing of IoT systems specifically; therefore, we present such an overview in this study. We analyze 803 papers from four major primary databases and perform detailed assessment and quality check to find 115 relevant papers. In addition, recently published testing techniques and approaches are analyzed and classified; the challenges and limitations in the field is also identified and discussed. Research trends related to publication time, active researchers, and publication media are presented in this study. The results suggest that studies mainly focus only on general testing methods, which can be applied to integration and interoperability testing of IoT systems; thus, there are research opportunities to develop additional testing methods focused specifically on IoT systems, so that they are more effective in the IoT context.",

These functionalities often come with significant privacy and security risks, with notable recent large scale coordinated global attacks disrupting large service providers. Thus, an important first step to address these risks is to know what IoT devices are where in a network. While some limited solutions exist, a key question is whether device discovery can be done by Internet service providers that only see sampled flow statistics. In particular, it is challenging for an ISP to efficiently and effectively track and trace activity from IoT devices deployed by its millions of subscribers --all with sampled network data. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a scalable methodology to accurately detect and monitor IoT devices at subscriber lines with limited, highly sampled data in-the-wild. Our findings indicate that millions of IoT devices are detectable and identifiable within hours, both at a major ISP as well as an IXP, using passive, sparsely sampled network flow headers. Our methodology is able to detect devices from more than 77% of the studied IoT manufacturers, including popular devices such as smart speakers. While our methodology is effective for providing network analytics, it also highlights significant privacy consequences.",

Commonly used onboarding techniques today include the use of QR codes, pin codes, or serial numbers. These techniques typically do not protect against unauthorized device access-a QR code is physically printed on the device, while a pin code may be included in the device packaging. As a result, any entity that has physical access to a device can onboard it onto their network and, potentially, tamper it (e.g.,install malware on the device). To address this problem, in this paper, we present a framework, called Deep Learning-based Watermarking for authorized IoT onboarding (DLWIoT), featuring a robust and fully automated image watermarking scheme based on deep neural networks. DLWIoT embeds user credentials into carrier images (e.g., QR codes printed on IoT devices), thus enables IoT onboarding only by authorized users. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of DLWIoT, indicating that authorized users can onboard IoT devices with DLWIoT within 2.5-3sec.",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin's success as a cryptocurrency enabled it to penetrate into many daily life transactions. Its problems regarding transaction fees and longer validation times are addressed through an innovative concept called Lightning Network (LN) which works on top of Bitcoin by leveraging off-chain transactions. This made Bitcoin an attractive micro-payment solution which can also be used within certain IoT applications (e.g., toll payments) since it eliminates the need for traditional centralized payment systems. Nevertheless, it is not possible to run LN on resource-constrained IoT devices due to its storage, memory, and processing requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient and secure protocol that enables an IoT device to use LN's functions through a gateway LN node even if it is not trusted. The idea is to involve the IoT device in LN operations with its digital signature by replacing original 2-of-2 multisignature channels to 3-of-3 multisignature channels. Once the gateway is delegated to open a channel for the IoT device in a secure manner, our protocol enforces this LN gateway to request the IoT device's digital consent for all further operations on the channel such as sending payments or closing the channel. LN's Bitcoin transactions are revised to incorporate 3-of-3 signatures. In addition, LN's revoked state broadcast procedure is modified to be able to operate under 3-of-3 multi-signature scheme. We evaluated the proposed protocol by implementing it on a Raspberry Pi for a toll payment scenario and demonstrated its feasibility and security.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the efficient deployment and mobility of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), used as aerial base stations to collect data from ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices, is investigated. In particular, to enable reliable uplink communications for IoT devices with a minimum total transmit power, a novel framework is proposed for jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) placement and mobility of the UAVs, device-UAV association, and uplink power control. First, given the locations of active IoT devices at each time instant, the optimal UAVs' locations and associations are determined. Next, to dynamically serve the IoT devices in a time-varying network, the optimal mobility patterns of the UAVs are analyzed. To this end, based on the activation process of the IoT devices, the time instances at which the UAVs must update their locations are derived. Moreover, the optimal 3D trajectory of each UAV is obtained in a way that the total energy used for the mobility of the UAVs is minimized while serving the IoT devices. Simulation results show that, using the proposed approach, the total transmit power of the IoT devices is reduced by 45% compared to a case in which stationary aerial base stations are deployed. In addition, the proposed approach can yield a maximum of 28% enhanced system reliability compared to the stationary case. The results also reveal an inherent tradeoff between the number of update times, the mobility of the UAVs, and the transmit power of the IoT devices. In essence, a higher number of updates can lead to lower transmit powers for the IoT devices at the cost of an increased mobility for the UAVs.",

The rigid existing Internet of things (IoT) architecture blocks current traffic management technology to provide a real differentiated service for large-scale IoT. Software-defined Internet of Things (SD-IoT) is a new computing paradigm that separates control plane and data plane, and enables centralized logic control. In this paper, we first present a general framework for SD-IoT, which consists of two main components: SD-IoT controllers and SD-IoT switches. The controllers of SD-IoT uses resource pooling technology, and the pool is responsible for the centralized control of the entire network. The switches of SD-IoT integrate with the gateway functions, which is responsible for data access and forwarding. The SD-IoT controller pool is designed as a vertical control architecture, which includes the main control layer and the base control layer. The controller (main controller) of the main control layer interacts upward with the application layer, interacts with the base control layer downwards, and the controller (base controller) of the basic control layer interacts with the data forwarding layer. We propose a dynamic balancing algorithm of the main controller based on election mechanism and a dynamic load balancing algorithm of the basic controller based on the balanced delay, respectively. The experimental results show that the dynamic balancing algorithm based on the election mechanism can ensure the consistency of the messages between the main controllers, and the dynamic load balancing algorithm based on the balanced delay can balance between these different workloads in the basic controllers.",

In this paper, we model and analyze an IoT network which harvests RF energy and receives information from the same wireless network. In order to enable this operation, each time slot is partitioned into charging and information reception phases. For this setup, we characterize two performance metrics: (i) energy coverage and (ii) joint signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) and energy coverage. The analysis is performed using a realistic spatial model that captures the spatial coupling between the locations of the IoT devices and the nodes of the wireless network (referred henceforth as the IoT gateways), which is often ignored in the literature. In particular, we model the locations of the IoT devices using a Poisson cluster process (PCP) and assume that some of the clusters have IoT gateways (GWs) deployed at their centers while the other GWs are deployed independently of the IoT devices. The level of coupling can be controlled by tuning the fraction of total GWs that are deployed at the cluster centers. Due to the inherent intractability of computing the distribution of shot noise process for this setup, we propose two accurate approximations, using which the aforementioned metrics are characterized. Multiple system design insights are drawn from our results. For instance, we demonstrate the existence of optimal slot partitioning that maximizes the system throughput. In addition, we explore the effect of the level of coupling between the locations of the IoT devices and the GWs on this optimal slot partitioning. Particularly, our results reveal that the optimal value of time duration for the charging phase increases as the level of coupling decreases.",

The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic categorisation of machine learning augmented techniques that can be used for fingerprinting IoT devices. This can serve as a baseline for comparing various IoT fingerprinting mechanisms, so that network administrators can choose one or more mechanisms that are appropriate for monitoring and maintaining their network. We carried out an extensive literature review of existing papers on fingerprinting IoT devices -- paying close attention to those with machine learning features. This is followed by an extraction of important and comparable features among the mechanisms outlined in those papers. As a result, we came up with a key set of terminologies that are relevant both in the fingerprinting context and in the IoT domain. This enabled us to construct a framework called IDWork, which can be used for categorising existing IoT fingerprinting mechanisms in a way that will facilitate a coherent and fair comparison of these mechanisms. We found that the majority of the IoT fingerprinting mechanisms take a passive approach -- mainly through network sniffing -- instead of being intrusive and interactive with the device of interest. Additionally, a significant number of the surveyed mechanisms employ both static and dynamic approaches, in order to benefit from complementary features that can be more robust against certain attacks such as spoofing and replay attacks.",

    "abstract": "The context-awareness of things that belong to IoT networks have to be considered in a distributed computation paradigm. In the paper we suggest the use of graph transformations and temporal logic as a formal framework for a knowledge representation of user/inhabitant behaviors in multi-agent systems. IoT networks are considered as graph structures. Dynamic preference models, understood as a priority in the selecting, is also introduced. Preference models as a result of observed behaviors base on formal logic, and they are built on-the-fly by software agents. Software agents gather knowledge about user preferences expressed in terms of logical specifications as well as suggest on-the-fly future behavior basing on the logical inference process using the semantic tableaux method. The predictive processes are result of some new and important events in the context of IoT systems that should meet a response. Due to the ubiquitous availability of cyber systems that interact with physical environments, there is a great need to develop technologies that target the whole IoT system as a context-awareness system. Formal approach increases the trustworthy of a system. A simple yet illustrative example is provided.",

In this paper, we survey over one hundred IoT smart solutions in the marketplace and examine them closely in order to identify the technologies used, functionalities, and applications. More importantly, we identify the trends, opportunities and open challenges in the industry-based the IoT solutions. Based on the application domain, we classify and discuss these solutions under five different categories: smart wearable, smart home, smart, city, smart environment, and smart enterprise. This survey is intended to serve as a guideline and conceptual framework for future research in the IoT and to motivate and inspire further developments. It also provides a systematic exploration of existing research and suggests a number of potentially significant research directions.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions that objects may be connected to the Internet, producing and consuming data in real-time. Today, numerous middleware platforms are available to facilitate the communication with these objects. Unfortunately, the interoperability of these platforms is very limited because it requires to \"manually\" connect the services proposed by each platform. One key design goal for our contribution is not to build yet another middleware, but rather to augment the functionalities of existing systems via an extension to support their integration into a network of heterogeneous IoT hubs. The extension includes a RESTful API to manipulate the basic component of our extension, the IoT feeds. The IoT feeds allow the platform's owner to dynamically marshal the IoT features connected to the platform, as well as the data that they produce. Furthermore, the feeds enable the owner to manage and control the data flows before connecting them to his applications. Subsequently, these feeds may also be published to meta-hubs in order to expose them to third parties. We evaluated an implementation our extension for Android systems to show the feasibility of managing the data flows using the RESTful API on this platform.",

It is expected that by 2020 over 25 billion devices will be connected to cellular networks; far beyond the number of devices in current wireless networks. Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications aims at providing the communication infrastructure for enabling IoT by facilitating the billions of multi-role devices to communicate with each other and with the underlying data transport infrastructure without, or with little, human intervention. Providing this infrastructure will require a dramatic shift from the current protocols mostly designed for human-to-human (H2H) applications. This article reviews recent 3GPP solutions for enabling massive cellular IoT and investigates the random access strategies for M2M communications, which shows that cellular networks must evolve to handle the new ways in which devices will connect and communicate with the system. A massive non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is then presented as a promising solution to support a massive number of IoT devices in cellular networks, where we also identify its practical challenges and future research directions.",

The low-power and low-complexity backscatter communications (BackCom), which simply relies on passive reflection and modulation of an incident radio-frequency (RF) wave, has emerged to be a promising technology for tackling this challenge. However, the contemporary BackCom has several major limitations, such as short transmission range, low data rate, and uni-directional information transmission.

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices communicate using a variety of protocols, differing in many aspects, with the channel access method being one of the most important. Most of the transmission technologies explicitly designed for IoT and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication use either an ALOHA-based channel access or some type of Listen Before Talk (LBT) strategy, based on carrier sensing. In this paper, we provide a comparative overview of the uncoordinated channel access methods for IoT technologies, namely ALOHA-based and LBT schemes, in relation with the ETSI and FCC regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, we provide a performance comparison of these access schemes, both in terms of successful transmissions and energy efficiency, in a typical IoT deployment. Results show that LBT is effective in reducing inter-node interference even for long-range transmissions, though the energy efficiency can be lower than that provided by ALOHA methods. The adoption of rate-adaptation schemes, furthermore, lowers the energy consumption while improving the fairness among nodes at different distances from the receiver. Coexistence issues are also investigated, showing that in massive deployments LBT is severely affected by the presence of ALOHA devices in the same area.",

However, despite the increasing popularity of `mobile IoT', little is known about the suitability of LPWAN for those mobile IoT applications in which nodes have varying degrees of mobility. To fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we conduct an experimental study to evaluate, analyze, and characterize LPWAN in both indoor and outdoor mobile environments. Our experimental results indicate that the performance of LPWAN is surprisingly susceptible to mobility, even to minor human mobility, and the effect of mobility significantly escalates as the distance to the gateway increases. These results call for development of new mobility-aware LPWAN protocols to support mobile IoT.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is intended for ubiquitous connectivity among different entities or \"things\". While its purpose is to provide effective and efficient solutions, security of the devices and network is a challenging issue. The number of devices connected along with the ad-hoc nature of the system further exacerbates the situation. Therefore, security and privacy has emerged as a significant challenge for the IoT. In this paper,we aim to provide a thorough survey related to the privacy and security challenges of the IoT. This document addresses these challenges from the perspective of technologies and architecture used. This work focuses also in IoT intrinsic vulnerabilities as well as the security challenges of various layers based on the security principles of data confidentiality, integrity and availability. This survey analyzes articles published for the IoT at the time and relates it to the security conjuncture of the field and its projection to the future.",

    "abstract": "Designing quality in is a cornerstone of modern quality management philosophies. Design for X (DfX) techniques provide guidelines, heuristics, and metrics to ensure that a particular quality attribute exists in a design. Although hundreds of papers have been published on DfX approaches, few researchers have explored systematically applying multiple DfX in a particular problem context. As the Internet of Things (IoT) evolves, boundaries between people, computers, and objects will become less distinct, underscoring the need for more holistic design. Using mixed methods, this paper examines the utility of DfX in the emerging IoT ecosystem. We identify DfX that are applicable to IoT-related design, and find gaps that demand further research and development. The results from this study can be used to help designers and quality managers select or develop appropriate DfX to use in designing components for the Internet of Things (IoT), supporting actionable strategies for quality and customer satisfaction.",

We created an imitation of a DoS attack on the system, and conducted a quantitative analysis to simulate the impact such an attack may potentially exert upon the system, assessing the trade off between security and throughput in the IoT system. We model this through stochastic model checking in PRISM and provide evidence that supports this as a valuable method to compare the efficiency of different implementations of IoT systems, exemplified by a case study.",

To fasten the emergence of novel applications, this vast infrastructure requires \"Platform as a Service(PaaS)\" model to leverage IoT things. As a single global standard for all device types and IoT-based application domain is impracticable, we propose an IoT-based Cloud to leverage PaaS model in this paper.

In this work, we propose a lightweight technique, IoT-guard, for identifying malicious traffic flows. IoT-guard uses semi-supervised learning to distinguish between malicious and benign device behaviours using the network traffic generated by devices. In order to achieve this, we extracted 39 features from network logs and discard any features containing redundant information. After feature selection, fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) algorithm was trained to obtain clusters discriminating benign traffic from malicious traffic. We studied the feature scores in these clusters and use this information to predict the type of new traffic flows. IoT-guard was evaluated using a real-world testbed with more than 30 devices. The results show that IoTguard achieves high accuracy (98%), in differentiating various types of malicious and benign traffic, with low false positive rates. Furthermore, it has low resource footprint and can operate on OpenWRT enabled access points and COTS computing boards.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the importance of accountability to data protection, and how it can be built into the Internet of Things (IoT). The need to build accountability into the IoT is motivated by the opaque nature of distributed data flows, inadequate consent mechanisms, and lack of interfaces enabling end-user control over the behaviours of internet-enabled devices. The lack of accountability precludes meaningful engagement by end-users with their personal data and poses a key challenge to creating user trust in the IoT and the reciprocal development of the digital economy. The EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) seeks to remedy this particular problem by mandating that a rapidly developing technological ecosystem be made accountable. In doing so it foregrounds new responsibilities for data controllers, including data protection by design and default, and new data subject rights such as the right to data portability. While GDPR is technologically neutral, it is nevertheless anticipated that realising the vision will turn upon effective technological development. Accordingly, this paper examines the notion of accountability, how it has been translated into systems design recommendations for the IoT, and how the IoT Databox puts key data protection principles into practice.",

    "abstract": "Embedded devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) face a wide variety of security challenges. For example, software attackers perform code injection and code-reuse attacks on their remote interfaces, and physical access to IoT devices allows to tamper with code in memory, steal confidential Intellectual Property (IP), or mount fault attacks to manipulate a CPU's control flow. In this work, we present Sponge-based Control Flow Protection (SCFP). SCFP is a stateful, sponge-based scheme to ensure the confidentiality of software IP and its authentic execution on IoT devices. At compile time, SCFP encrypts and authenticates software with instruction-level granularity. During execution, an SCFP hardware extension between the CPU's fetch and decode stage continuously decrypts and authenticates instructions. Sponge-based authenticated encryption in SCFP yields fine-grained control-flow integrity and thus prevents code-reuse, code-injection, and fault attacks on the code and the control flow. In addition, SCFP withstands any modification of software in memory. For evaluation, we extended a RISC-V core with SCFP and fabricated a real System on Chip (SoC). The average overhead in code size and execution time of SCFP on this design is 19.8% and 9.1%, respectively, and thus meets the requirements of embedded IoT devices.",

Monitoring if such sequencing constraints are honoured when IoT devices are accessed provides a means to fence off malicious accesses. This paper proposes a history-based capability system, HCAP, for enforcing permission sequencing constraints in a distributed authorization environment.

The real value of such assets can only be realized by allowing IoT data trading to occur on a marketplace that rewards every single producer and consumer, at a very granular level. Crucially, we believe that such a marketplace should not be owned by anybody, and should instead fairly and transparently self-enforce a well defined set of governance rules. In this paper we address some of the technical challenges involved in realizing such a marketplace. We leverage emerging blockchain technologies to build a decentralized, trusted, transparent and open architecture for IoT traffic metering and contract compliance, on top of the largely adopted IoT brokered data infrastructure. We discuss an Ethereum-based prototype implementation and experimentally evaluate the overhead cost associated with Smart Contract transactions, concluding that a viable business model can indeed be associated with our technical approach.",

The growth of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is frequently claimed to place privacy at risk. However, the Paradox remains underexplored in the IoT. In addressing this, we first conduct an online survey (N = 170) to compare public opinions of IoT and less-novel devices. Although we find users perceive privacy risks, many still decide to purchase smart devices. With the IoT rated less usable/familiar, we assert that it constrains protective behaviour. To explore this hypothesis, we perform contextualised interviews (N = 40) with the public. In these dialogues, owners discuss their opinions and actions with a personal device. We find the Paradox is significantly more prevalent in the IoT, frequently justified by a lack of awareness. We finish by highlighting the qualitative comments of users, and suggesting practical solutions to their issues. This is the first work, to our knowledge, to evaluate the Privacy Paradox over a broad range of technologies.",

Several IoT devices are used in such applications e.g., sensors and robots. These sensors and robots are usually heterogeneous. Moreover, in disaster scenarios, the existing communication infrastructure may become completely or partially destroyed, leaving mobile ad-hoc networks the only alternative to provide connectivity. Utilizing these applications raises new challenges such as the need for dynamic, flexible, and distributed gateways which can accommodate new applications and new IoT devices. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) are emerging paradigms that can help to overcome these challenges. This paper leverages NFV and SDN to propose an architecture for on-the-fly distributed gateway provisioning in large-scale disaster management. In the proposed architecture, the gateway functions are provisioned as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) that are chained on-the-fly in the IoT domain using SDN.

Shaping traffic flows to fit distributions independent of user activities can protect privacy, but this approach has seen little adoption due to required developer effort and overhead bandwidth costs. Here, we present a Python library for IoT developers to easily integrate privacy-preserving traffic shaping into their products. The library replaces standard networking functions with versions that automatically obfuscate device traffic patterns through a combination of payload padding, fragmentation, and randomized cover traffic. Our library successfully preserves user privacy and requires approximately 4 KB/s overhead bandwidth for IoT devices with low send rates or high latency tolerances. This overhead is reasonable given normal Internet speeds in American homes and is an improvement on the bandwidth requirements of existing solutions.",

To increase attacks' success chance and resilience against defence mechanisms, modern botnets have often a decentralized P2P structure.

Notable examples are DDoS attacks on Krebs on Security and DYN, which have been performed by IoT devices part of botnets. We take a first step towards detecting P2P botnets in IoT, by proposing AutoBotCatcher, whose design is driven by the consideration that bots of the same botnet frequently communicate with each other and form communities. As such, the purpose of AutoBotCatcher is to dynamically analyze communities of IoT devices, formed according to their network traffic flows, to detect botnets. AutoBotCatcher exploits a permissioned Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain, as a state transition machine that allows collaboration of a set of pre-identified parties without trust, in order to perform collaborative and dynamic botnet detection by collecting and auditing IoT devices' network traffic flows as blockchain transactions. In this paper, we focus on the design of the AutoBotCatcher by first defining the blockchain structure underlying AutoBotCatcher, then discussing its components.",

    "abstract": "This paper is focused on mapping the current evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) and its associated cyber risks for the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) sector. We report the results of a qualitative empirical study that correlates academic literature with 14 - I4.0 frameworks and initiatives. We apply the grounded theory approach to synthesise the findings from our literature review, to compare the cyber security frameworks and cyber security quantitative impact assessment models, with the world leading I4.0 technological trends. From the findings, we build a new impact assessment model of IoT cyber risk in Industry 4.0. We therefore advance the efforts of integrating standards and governance into Industry 4.0 and offer a better understanding of economics impact assessment models for I4.0.",

    "abstract": "The latency issue of the cloud-centric IoT management system has motivated Fog and Edge Computing (FEC) architecture, which distributes the tasks from the cloud to the edge resources such as routers, switches or the IoT devices themselves. Specifically, mobile sensors of IoT system can also carry certain tasks for FEC. Considering the need of dynamic process migration from the mobile sensors to other resources when the mobile sensors unable to continue their tasks, the IoT system needs to provide a flexible mechanism that allows the mobile sensors dynamically migrate their tasks to the other FEC resource at runtime. However, it raises a question in what is the optimal approach when the mobile sensors intend to migrate their tasks to multiple heterogeneous FEC resource? In order to address the question, the authors propose REM scheme, which is capable of optimising the process migration decision. Further, in order to realise such a system and to validate the REM scheme, the authors have developed EPIoT host framework. Finally, the authors have implemented and have evaluated the REM scheme and framework, the results have shown that the REM scheme is capable of enhancing the performance of the process migration in heterogeneous FEC environment.",

    "abstract": "Data aggregation is an effective solution to enable cellular support of Internet-of-things (IoT) communications. Indeed, it helps alleviate channel congestion, reduce the communication range, and extend battery-lifetime. In this paper, we use stochastic geometry to analyze the performance of uplink cellular IoT using different deployment strategies of aggregators, including terrestrial and aerial ones, e.g., drones or unmanned aerial vehicles. We focus on IoT-specific performance metrics, that are typically used by 3GPP. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions of the average transmit power consumption, which is key to determine the lifetime of IoT devices, as well as the maximum coupling loss, which is essential to determine the maximum coverage the cellular system can support. Simulation results are presented to validate the derived theoretical expressions. It is shown that aerial aggregators can significantly extend the device lifetime and provide superior coverage compared to other deployment strategies. In addition, random deployment performs well when aggregators are densely deployed, whereas optimizing the location of a single terrestrial aggregator is beneficial when devices are more clustered.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications have recently emerged as applications that can involve sensors, wireless devices, machines and software that can exchange data and be accessed remotely. Such applications have been proposed in several domains including health care, smart cities and agriculture. However, despite their increased adoption, deploying these applications in specific settings has been very challenging because of the complex static and dynamic variability of the physical devices such as sensors and actuators, the software application behavior and the environment in which the application is embedded. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for IoT analytics based on learning embodied agents (i.e. situated agents). The approach involves: (i) a variability model of IoT embodied agents; (ii) feedback evaluative machine learning; and (iii) reconfiguration of a group of agents in accordance with environmental context. The proposed approach advances the state of the art in that it facilitates the development of Agent-based IoT applications by explicitly capturing their complex and dynamic variabilities and supporting their self-configuration based on an context-aware and machine learning-based approach.",

Instead of a single chain of blocks, DLedger builds the ledger over a directed acyclic graph (DAG), so that its operations can tolerate network partition and intermittent connectivity. Instead of compute-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW), DLedger utilizes Proof-of-Authentication (PoA), whose light-weight operations are IoT-friendly, to achieve consensus. Furthermore, DLedger is built upon a data-centric network called Named Data Networking (NDN), which facilitates the peer-to-peer data dissemination in heterogeneous IoT networks.",

This work focuses on the challenges and potential solutions for an effective integration of DLTs in the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT). We first introduce the landscape of IoT applications and discuss the limitations and opportunities offered by DLTs. Then, we review the technical challenges encountered in the integration of resource-constrained devices with distributed trust networks. We describe the common traits of lightweight synchronization protocols, and propose a novel classification, rooted in the IoT perspective.

Harnessing the special features of bacteria, including an ability to become autonomous - helped by an embedded, natural propeller motor - the microbes show promising array of application in healthcare and environmental health. In this paper, we briefly outline significant features of bacteria that allow analogies between them and traditional computerized IoT device to be made. We argue that such comparisons are critical in terms of helping researchers to explore human-bacteria interaction in the context of IoT and HCI. Furthermore, we highlight the current lack of tangible infrastructure for researchers in IoT and HCI to access and experiment with bacteria. As a potential solution, we propose to utilize the DIY biology movement and gamification techniques to leverage user engagement and introduction to bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Internet of things is growing with a large number of diverse objects which generate billions of data streams by sensing, actuating and communicating. Management of heterogeneous IoT objects with existing approaches and processing of myriads of data from these objects using monolithic services have become major challenges in developing effective IoT applications. The heterogeneity can be resolved by providing interoperability with semantic virtualization of objects. Moreover, monolithic services can be substituted with modular microservices. This article presents an architecture that enables the development of IoT applications using semantically interoperable microservices and virtual objects. The proposed framework supports analytic features with knowledge-driven and data-driven techniques to provision intelligent services on top of interoperable microservices in Web Objects enabled IoT environment. The knowledge-driven aspects are supported with reasoning on semantic ontology models and the data-driven aspects are realized with machine learning pipeline. The development of service functionalities is supported with microservices to enhance modularity and reusability. To evaluate the proposed framework a proof of concept implementation with a use case is discussed.",

In order to improve the efficiency of energy harvest and energy utilization, we propose a new model to accurately describe the energy harvesting process and the power consumption for sustainable IoT devices.

In an IoT setting, improving and scaling network components as well as reducing cost is essential to sustain exponential growth. In this domain, software-defined networking (SDN) is revolutionizing the network infrastructure with a new paradigm. SDN splits the control/routing logic from the data transfer/forwarding. This splitting causes many issues in SDN, such as vulnerabilities of DDoS attacks. Many solutions (including blockchain based) have been proposed to overcome these problems. In this work, we offer a blockchain-based solution that is provided in redundant SDN (load-balanced) to service millions of IoT devices. Blockchain is considered as tamper-proof and impossible to corrupt due to the replication of the ledger and consensus for verification and addition to the ledger. Therefore, it is a perfect fit for SDN in IoT Networks. Blockchain technology provides everyone with a working proof of decentralized trust.

Specifically, with the ``sensing-then-control'' protocol, we first develop an optimization framework which jointly takes control, sensing and communications into account. In this framework, we derive the spectral efficiency, linear quadratic regulator cost and energy consumption. Then, a novel performance metric called the \\textit{energy-to-control efficiency} is proposed for the IoT control system. In addition, we optimize the energy-to-control efficiency while guaranteeing the requirements of URLLCs, thereupon a general and complex max-min joint optimization problem is formulated for the IoT control system. To optimally solve the formulated problem by reasonable complexity, we propose two radio resource allocation algorithms. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed algorithms can significantly improve the energy-to-control efficiency for the IoT control system with URLLCs.",

    "abstract": "Network traffic whitelisting has emerged as a dominant approach for securing consumer IoT devices. However, determining what the whitelisted behavior of an IoT device should be remains an open challenge. Proposals to date have relied on manufacturers and trusted parties to provide whitelists, but these proposals require manufacturer involvement or placing trust in an additional stakeholder. Alternatively, locally monitoring devices can allow building whitelists of observed behavior, but devices may not exhaust their functionality set during the observation period, or the behavior may change following a software update which requires re-training. This paper proposes a blockchain-based system for determining whether an IoT device is behaving like other devices of the same type. Our system (SERENIoT, pronounced Serenity) overcomes the challenge of initially determining the correct behavior for a device. Nodes in the SERENIoT public blockchain submit summaries of the network behavior observed for connected IoT devices and build whitelists of behavior observed by the majority of nodes. Changes in behavior through software updates are automatically whitelisted once the update is broadly deployed. Through a proof-of-concept implementation of SERENIoT on a small Raspberry Pi IoT network and a large-scale Amazon EC2 simulation, we evaluate the security, scalability, and performance of our system.",

Literature reports many experiences of software development for IoT smart applications. However, architectural solutions are presented with no rationale for the choice of software components and the way they relate to each other.

The IoT networks with limited bandwidth and low power devices may not be able to support such frequent transmissions with high data rates. To ensure communication efficiency, this article proposes to model the measurement compression at IoT nodes and the inference at the base station or cloud as a deep neural network (DNN). We propose a new framework where the data to be transmitted from nodes are the intermediate outputs of a layer of the DNN. We show how to learn the model parameters of the DNN and study the trade-off between the communication rate and the inference accuracy.

The results of the MILP model show that our optimized NN can save up to 86% by embedding processing modules in IoT devices and up to 72% in fog nodes due to the limited capacity of IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "Internet-of-things (IoT) is perpetually revolutionizing our daily life and rapidly transforming physical objects into an ubiquitous connected ecosystem. Due to their massive deployment and moderate security levels, those devices face a lot of security, management, and control challenges. Their classical centralized architecture is still cloaking vulnerabilities and anomalies that can be exploited by hackers for spying, eavesdropping, and taking control of the network. In this paper, we propose to improve the IoT architecture with additional security features using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. We propose a novel architecture based on permissioned blockchain technology in order to build a scalable and decentralized end-to-end secure IoT system. Furthermore, we enhance the IoT system security with an AI-component at the gateway level to detect and classify suspected activities, malware, and cyber-attacks using machine learning techniques. Simulations and practical implementation show that the proposed architecture delivers high performance against cyber-attacks.",

However, the increasing demand for healthcare data privacy and security makes each IoT device an isolated island of data. Further, the limited computation and communication capacity of wearable healthcare devices restrict the application of vanilla federated learning. To this end, we propose an advanced federated learning framework to train deep neural networks, where the network is partitioned and allocated to IoT devices and a centralized server. Then most of the training computation is handled by the powerful server. The sparsification of activations and gradients significantly reduces the communication overhead. Empirical study have suggested that the proposed framework guarantees a low accuracy loss, while only requiring 0.2% of the synchronization traffic in vanilla federated learning.",

For these distributed devices in IoT networks, how to ensure their security and privacy becomes a significant challenge. The blockchain technology provides a promising solution to protect the data integrity, provenance, privacy, and consistency for IoT networks. In blockchains, communication is a prerequisite for participants, which are distributed in the system, to reach consensus. However, in IoT networks, most of the devices communicate through wireless links, which are not always reliable. Hence, the communication reliability of IoT devices influences the system security. In this article, we rethink the roles of communication and computing in blockchains by accounting for communication reliability. We analyze the tradeoff between communication reliability and computing power in blockchain security, and present a lower bound to the computing power that is needed to conduct an attack with a given communication reliability. Simulation results show that adversarial nodes can succeed in tampering a block with less computing power by hindering the propagation of blocks from other nodes.",

    "abstract": "Predictive analytics in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) based Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a high demand in many real-world applications. A prediction problem in an MEC-based IoT environment typically corresponds to a collection of tasks with each task solved in a specific MEC environment based on the data accumulated locally, which can be regarded as a Multi-task Learning (MTL) problem. However, the heterogeneity of the data (non-IIDness) accumulated across different MEC environments challenges the application of general MTL techniques in such a setting. Federated MTL (FMTL) has recently emerged as an attempt to address this issue. Besides FMTL, there exists another powerful but under-exploited distributed machine learning technique, called Network Lasso (NL), which is inherently related to FMTL but has its own unique features. In this paper, we made an in-depth evaluation and comparison of these two techniques on three distinct IoT datasets representing real-world application scenarios. Experimental results revealed that NL outperformed FMTL in MEC-based IoT environments in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.",

Addressing this gap, we introduce a new method for extracting a hardware fingerprint of an IoT sensor which can be used for secret-free authentication. By comparing the fingerprint against reference measurements recorded prior to deployment, we can tell whether the sensing hardware connected to the IoT device has been changed by environmental effects or with malicious intent. Our approach exploits the characteristic behavior of analog circuits, which is revealed by applying a fixed-frequency alternating current to the sensor, while recording its output voltage. To demonstrate the general feasibility of our method, we apply it to four commercially available temperature sensors using laboratory equipment and evaluate the accuracy. The results indicate that with a sensible configuration of the two hyperparameters we can identify individual sensors with high probability, using only a few recordings from the target device.",

Unsupervised techniques, such as anomaly detection, can be used to secure these devices in a plug-and-protect manner. However, anomaly detection models must be trained for a long time in order to capture all benign behaviors. Furthermore, the anomaly detection model is vulnerable to adversarial attacks since, during the training phase, all observations are assumed to be benign. In this paper, we propose (1) a novel approach for anomaly detection and (2) a lightweight framework that utilizes the blockchain to ensemble an anomaly detection model in a distributed environment. Blockchain framework incrementally updates a trusted anomaly detection model via self-attestation and consensus among the IoT devices. We evaluate our method on a distributed IoT simulation platform, which consists of 48 Raspberry Pis.

Next, we exploit the temporal correlation of the traffic events and apply the forward algorithm in the context of hidden Markov models (HMM) in order to predict the activation likelihood of each IoT device. Finally, we apply the fast uplink grant scheme in order to allocate resources to the IoT devices that have the maximal likelihood for transmission. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we define the regret metric as the number of missed resource allocation opportunities. The proposed fast uplink scheme based on traffic prediction outperforms both conventional random access and time division duplex in terms of regret and efficiency of system usage, while it maintains its superiority over random access in terms of average age of information for massive deployments.",

Rather than time division multiple access (TDMA) or frequency division multiple access (FDMA) with multi-color pattern, a new non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is adopted to support massive IoT distributed over a very wide range. Considering the limited energy on the LEO satellite, two robust beamforming algorithms against channel phase uncertainty are proposed for minimizing the total power consumption in the scenarios of noncritical IoT applications and critical IoT applications, respectively.

    "abstract": "In IoT data processing, cloud computing alone does not suffice due to latency constraints, bandwidth limitations, and privacy concerns. By introducing intermediary nodes closer to the edge of the network that offer compute services in proximity to IoT devices, fog computing can reduce network strain and high access latency to application services. While this is the only viable approach to enable efficient IoT applications, the issue of component placement among cloud and intermediary nodes in the fog adds a new dimension to system design. State-of-the-art solutions to this issue rely on either simulation or solving a formalized assignment problem through heuristics, which are both inaccurate and fail to scale with a solution space that grows exponentially. In this paper, we present a three step process for designing practical fog-based IoT applications that uses best practices, simulation, and testbed analysis to converge towards an efficient system architecture. We then apply this process in a smart factory case study. By deploying filtered options to a physical testbed, we show that each step of our process converges towards more efficient application designs.",

However, since IoT devices are usually resource-constrained, lightweight block ciphers have played a major role in serving as a building block for secure IoT protocols. In CHES 2015, SIMECK, a family of block ciphers, was designed for resource-constrained IoT devices. Since its publication, there have been many analyses on its security. In this paper, under the one bit-flip model, we propose a new efficient fault analysis attack on SIMECK ciphers. Compared to those previously reported attacks, our attack can recover the full master key by injecting faults into only a single round of all SIMECK family members. This property is crucial, as it is infeasible for an attacker to inject faults into different rounds of a SIMECK implementation on IoT devices in the real world. Specifically, our attack is characterized by exercising a deep analysis of differential trail between the correct and faulty immediate ciphertexts. Extensive simulation evaluations are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of our proposed attack.",

    "abstract": "With the recent advancement of technologies over the past year, IoT has become a paradigm in which devices communicate with each other and the cloud to achieve various applications in multidisciplinary fields. However, developing, deploying, and experimenting with IoT applications are still tedious, expensive, and time-consuming due to the factors like heterogeneity of hardware and software. This is where an IoT testbed plays a vital role in aiding developers to test their applications without being deploying it to the target environment. In this paper, we present a testbed that is scalable for heterogeneous devices and mainly focused on a small scale and medium scale IoT application. This testbed would be best suited for testing applications which demand robust nature, remote monitoring and control, incorporation of heterogeneous devices, location tracking of devices, and easy troubleshooting with security and internet connectivity concerns. This testbed is also embraced with the feature to work limit access to the internet. A detailed explanation of the design and architecture of the proposed testbed is provided. We also present a conceptual prototype of the testbed and the results obtained on experimenting under various conditions.",

In this paper, we describe two synchronization protocols in IoT, its features and the advantages over the other. In addition, this work reveals the importance of time synchronization in the IoT platform and the effects of bad syncs in real-time applications. We start our research by analysing the widely using Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) and its performance in terms of offset and delay to examine the accuracy and reliability to define the synchronization.",

    "abstract": "One of the main drivers of 5G cellular networks is provision of connectivity service for various Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Considering the potential volume of IoT devices at a global scale, the next leap is to integrate Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) into 5G terrestrial systems, thereby extend the coverage and complement the terrestrial service. This paper focuses on the use of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations for two specific purposes: offloading and backhauling. The former allows offloading IoT traffic from a congested terrestrial network, usually in a very dense area. In the latter application, the constellation provides a multi-hop backhaul that connects a remote terrestrial gNB to the 5G core network. After providing an overview of the status of the 3GPP standardization process, we model and analyze the user data performance, specifically in the uplink access and the satellite multi-hop constellation path. The evaluation of the collisions, the delay and the Age of Information, and the comparison of the terrestrial and the satellite access networks provide useful insights to understand the potential of LEO constellations for offloading and backhauling of IoT traffic.",

In this work, we formulate a problem of autonomous maintenance in IoT networks as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. Subsequently, we utilize Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms (DRL) to train agents that decide if a maintenance procedure is in order or not and, in the former case, the proper type of maintenance needed. To avoid wasting the scarce resources of IoT networks we utilize the Age of Information (AoI) metric as a reward signal for the training of the smart agents. AoI captures the freshness of the sensory data which are transmitted by the IoT sensors as part of their normal service provision. Numerical results indicate that AoI integrates enough information about the past and present states of the system to be successfully used in the training of smart agents for the autonomous maintenance of the network.",

We address the anomaly explanation problem for multivariate IoT data and propose a 3-step self-contained method in this paper. We formalize and utilize the domain knowledge in our method, and identify the anomalies by the violation of constraints. We propose set-cover-based anomaly explanation algorithms to discover the anomaly events reflected by violation features, and further develop knowledge update algorithms to improve the original knowledge set. Experimental results on real datasets from large-scale IoT systems verify that our method computes high-quality explanation solutions of anomalies. Our work provides a guide to navigate the explicable anomaly detection in both IoT fault diagnosis and temporal data cleaning.",

Using tools from stochastic geometry and queueing theory, a novel mathematical framework is developed for static and dynamic rate adaptation schemes. The results show that there is an optimal static rate that minimizes latency, which depends on the network parameters. Furthermore, the dynamic rate is shown to be resilient to different variations in the network parameters without sacrificing packet latency.",

Several approaches to tacking this challenge have been proposed in the fields of wireless sensor networks and ubiquitous and pervasive computing, regarded as precursors to the modern day of IoT. However, although existing approaches provide a wide range of features, stakeholders have specific application development requirements and choosing an appropriate approach requires thorough evaluations on different aspects. To date, this aspect has been investigated to a limited extend. In view of this, this paper provides an extensive set of evaluations based on our previous work on IoT application development framework. Specifically, we evaluate our approach in terms of (1) development effort: the effort required to create a new application, (2) reusability: the extend to which software artifacts can be reused during application development, (3) expressiveness: the characteristics of IoT applications that can be modeled using our approach, (4) memory metrics: the amount of memory and storage a device needs to consume in order to run an application under our framework, and (5) comparison of our approach with state of the art in IoT application development on various dimensions, which does not only provide a comprehensive view of state of the art, but also guides developers in selecting an approach given application requirements in hand. We believe that the above different aspects provide the research community with insight into evaluating, selecting, and developing useful IoT frameworks and applications.",

The IoT field sensor plays a vital role in sensing the intelligent object/things and making an intelligent decision after sensing the objects. The rapid development of new applications using smartphones in the world caused all users of the IoT community to be faced with one major challenge of security in the form of side channel attacks against highly intensive 3D printing systems. The smartphone formulated Intellectual property (IP) of side channel attacks investigate against 3D printer in the physical domain through reconstructed G-code file through primitive operations. The smartphone (Nexus 5) solved the main problems such as orientation fixing, model accuracy of frame size and validate the feasibility and effectiveness in real case studies against the 3D printer.

It is of high concern that these smart things are being targeted by cyber criminals taking advantage of heterogeneity, minuscule security features and vulnerabilities within these devices. Conventional centralized IT security measures have limitations in terms of scalability and cost. Therefore, these smart devices are required to be monitored closer to their location ideally at the edge of IoT networks. In this paper, we explore how some security features can be implemented at the network edge to secure these smart devices. We explain the importance of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in order to deploy security functions at the network edge. To achieve this goal, we introduce NETRA - a novel lightweight Docker-based architecture for virtualizing network functions to provide IoT security. Also, we highlight the advantages of the proposed architecture over the standardized NFV architecture in terms of storage, memory usage, latency, throughput, load average, scalability and explain why the standardized architecture is not suitable for IoT. We study the performance of proposed NFV based edge analysis for IoT security and show that attacks can be detected with more than 95% accuracy in less than a second.",

Establishing trustworthy relationships among the objects greatly improves the effectiveness of node interaction in the social IoT and helps nodes overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk. However, there are limitations in the existing trust models. In this paper, a comprehensive model of trust is proposed that is tailored to the social IoT. The model includes ingredients such as trustor, trustee, goal, trustworthiness evaluation, decision, action, result, and context. Building on this trust model, we clarify the concept of trust in the social IoT in five aspects such as (1) mutuality of trustor and trustee, (2) inferential transfer of trust, (3) transitivity of trust, (4) trustworthiness update, and (5) trustworthiness affected by dynamic environment. With network connectivities that are from real-world social networks, a series of simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the social IoT operated with the proposed trust model. An experimental IoT network is used to further validate the proposed trust model.",

In this paper, we study the allocation of fog computing resources to the IoT users in a hierarchical computing paradigm including fog and remote cloud computing services. We formulate a computation offloading game to model the competition between IoT users and allocate the limited processing power of fog nodes efficiently. Each user aims to maximize its own quality of experience (QoE), which reflects its satisfaction of using computing services in terms of the reduction in computation energy and delay. Utilizing a potential game approach, we prove the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium and provide an upper bound for the price of anarchy. Since the time complexity to reach the equilibrium increases exponentially in the number of users, we further propose a near-optimal resource allocation mechanism and prove that in a system with $N$ IoT users, it can achieve an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium in $O(N/\\epsilon)$ time. Through numerical studies, we evaluate the users' QoE as well as the equilibrium efficiency. Our results reveal that by utilizing the proposed mechanism, more users benefit from computing services in comparison to an existing offloading mechanism. We further show that our proposed mechanism significantly reduces the computation delay and enables low-latency fog computing services for delay-sensitive IoT applications.",

In a blockchain network, the states of the accounts are stored and updated by the validator nodes, interconnected in a peer-to-peer fashion. IoT devices are characterized by relatively low computing capabilities and low power consumption, as well as sporadic and low-bandwidth wireless connectivity. An IoT device connects to one or more validator nodes to observe or modify the state of the accounts. In order to interact with the most recent state of accounts, a device needs to be synchronized with the blockchain copy stored by the validator nodes. In this work, we describe general architectures and synchronization protocols that enable synchronization of the IoT endpoints to the blockchain, with different communication costs and security levels. We model and analytically characterize the traffic generated by the synchronization protocols, and also investigate the power consumption and synchronization trade-off via numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that rigorously models the role of wireless connectivity in blockchain-powered IoT systems.",

We show how the combination of these two analyses yields further benefits hardly achievable by separately using each of them. We exploit two independently developed tools for the analyses. Firstly, we specify IoT systems in IoT-LySa, a simple specification language featuring asynchronous multicast communication of tuples. The values carried by the tuples are drawn from a term-algebra obtained by a parametric signature. The analysis of communication soundness is supported by ChorGram, a tool developed to verify the compatibility of communicating finite-state machines. In order to combine the analyses we implement an encoding of IoT-LySa processes into communicating machines. This encoding is not completely straightforward because IoT-LySa has multicast communications with data, while communication machines are based on point-to-point communications where only finitely many symbols can be exchanged. To highlight the benefits of our approach we appeal to a simple yet illustrative example.",

To ensure secure and reliable data communication between end-to-end (E2E) devices supported by current IoT and cloud infrastructure, trust management is needed at the IoT and user ends. This paper introduces a Neuro-Fuzzy based Brain-inspired trust management model (TMM) to secure IoT devices and relay nodes, and to ensure data reliability. The proposed TMM utilizes node behavioral trust and data trust estimated using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System and weighted-additive methods respectively to assess the nodes trustworthiness. In contrast to the existing fuzzy based TMMs, the NS2 simulation results confirm the robustness and accuracy of the proposed TMM in identifying malicious nodes in the communication network. With the growing usage of cloud based IoT frameworks in Neuroscience research, integrating the proposed TMM into the existing infrastructure will assure secure and reliable data communication among the E2E devices.",

    "abstract": "The tradeoff between cost of the access network and quality of offered service to IoT devices, in terms of reliability and durability of communications, is investigated. We first develop analytical tools for reliability evaluation in uplink-oriented large-scale IoT networks. These tools comprise modeling of interference from heterogeneous interfering sources with time-frequency asynchronous radio-resource usage patterns, and benefit from realistic distribution processes for modeling channel fading and locations of interfering sources. We further present a cost model for the access network as a function of provisioned resources like density of access points (APs), and a battery lifetime model for IoT devices as a function of intrinsic parameters, e.g. level of stored energy, and network parameters, e.g. reliability of communication. The derived models represent the ways in which a required level of reliability can be achieved by either sacrificing battery lifetime (durability), e.g. increasing number of replica transmissions, or sacrificing network cost and increasing provisioned resources, e.g. density of the APs. Then, we investigate optimal resource provisioning and operation control strategies, where the former aims at finding the optimized investment in the access network based on the cost of each resource; while the latter aims at optimizing data transmission strategies of IoT devices. The simulation results confirm tightness of derived analytical expressions, and show how the derived expressions can be used in finding optimal operation points of IoT networks.",

This Internet (IoT) brings the promise to interconnect billions of devices in the next few years rises several scientific challenges in particular those of the satisfaction of the quality of service (QoS) required by the IoT applications. In order to address this problem, we have identified two bottlenecks with respect to the QoS: the traversed networks and the intermediate entities that allows the application to interact with the IoT devices. In this paper, we first present an innovative vision of a \"network function\" with respect to their deployment and runtime environment. Then, we describe our general approach of a solution that consists in the dynamic, autonomous, and seamless deployment of QoS management mechanisms.

    "abstract": "As a revolution in networking, Internet of Things (IoT) aims at automating the operations of our societies by connecting and leveraging an enormous number of distributed devices (e.g., sensors and actuators). One design challenge is efficient wireless data aggregation (WDA) over tremendous IoT devices. This can enable a series of IoT applications ranging from latency-sensitive high-mobility sensing to data-intensive distributed machine learning. Over-the-air (functional) computation (AirComp) has emerged to be a promising solution that merges computing and communication by exploiting analogwave addition in the air. Another IoT design challenge is battery recharging for dense sensors which can be tackled by wireless power transfer (WPT). The coexisting of AirComp and WPT in IoT system calls for their integration to enhance the performance and efficiency of WDA. This motivates the current work on developing the wirelessly powered AirComp (WP-AirComp) framework by jointly optimizing wireless power control, energy and (data) aggregation beamforming to minimize the AirComp error. To derive a practical solution, we recast the non-convex joint optimization problem into the equivalent outer and inner sub-problems for (inner) wireless power control and energy beamforming, and (outer) the efficient aggregation beamforming, respectively. The former is solved in closed form while the latter is efficiently solved using the semidefinite relaxation technique. The results reveal that the optimal energy beams point to the dominant eigen-directions of the WPT channels, and the optimal power allocation tends to equalize the close-loop (down-link WPT and up-link AirComp) effective channels of different sensors. Simulation demonstrates that controlling WPT provides additional design dimensions for substantially reducing the AirComp error.",

However, existing IoT platforms and framework rely on dedicated middleware for (semi-) centralized task dispatching, data storage and incentive provision. Consequently, they are usually expensive to deploy, have limited adaptability to diverse requirements, and face a series of data security and privacy issues. In this paper, we employ permissionless blockchains to construct a purely decentralized platform for data storage and trading in a wireless-powered IoT crowdsensing system. In the system, IoT sensors use power wirelessly transferred from RF-energy beacons for data sensing and transmission to an access point. The data is then forwarded to the blockchain for distributed ledger services, i.e., data/transaction verification, recording, and maintenance. Due to coupled interference of wireless transmission and transaction fee incurred from blockchain's distributed ledger services, rational sensors have to decide on their transmission rates to maximize individual utility. Thus, we formulate a noncooperative game model to analyze this competitive situation among the sensors. We provide the analytical condition for the existence of the Nash equilibrium as well as a series of insightful numerical results about the equilibrium strategies in the game.",

With the advent of the IoT, embedded controllers link these `things' to local networks that often are of low power wireless kind, and are interconnected via gateways to some cloud from the global Internet. Inter-networked sensors and actuators in the industrial IoT form a critical subsystem while frequently operating under harsh conditions. It is currently under debate how to approach inter-networking of critical industrial components in a safe and secure manner. In this paper, we analyze the potentials of ICN for providing a secure and robust networking solution for constrained controllers in industrial safety systems. We showcase hazardous gas sensing in widespread industrial environments, such as refineries, and compare with IP-based approaches such as CoAP and MQTT. Our findings indicate that the content-centric security model, as well as enhanced DoS resistance are important arguments for deploying Information Centric Networking in a safety-critical industrial IoT. Evaluation of the crypto efforts on the RIOT operating system for content security reveal its feasibility for common deployment scenarios.",

We adopt LoRa technology as an example in the IoT network, but this work is still suitable for other communication technologies. Allocating limited resources, like spectrum and energy resources, among a massive number of users faces critical challenges. We consider grouping wireless powered IoT users into available channels first and then investigate power allocation for users grouped in the same channel to improve the network throughput. Specifically, the user grouping problem is formulated as a many to one matching game. It is achieved by considering IoT users and channels as selfish players which belong to two disjoint sets. Both selfish players focus on maximizing their own utilities. Then we propose an efficient channel allocation algorithm (ECAA) with low complexity for user grouping. Additionally, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is used to model unpredictable energy arrival and channel conditions uncertainty at each user, and a power allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize the accumulative network throughput over a finite-horizon of time slots. By doing so, we can distribute the channel access and dynamic power allocation local to IoT users. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed ECAA algorithm achieves near-optimal performance and is superior to random channel assignment, but has much lower computational complexity. Moreover, simulations show that the distributed power allocation policy for each user is obtained with better performance than a centralized offline scheme.",

To tackle both the scalability and trust issues and to automatize the payments, this paper presents a blockchain based proxy re-encryption scheme. The system stores the IoT data in a distributed cloud after encryption. To share the collected IoT data, the system establishes runtime dynamic smart contracts between the sensor and data user without the involvement of a trusted third party. It also uses a very efficient proxy re-encryption scheme which allows that the data is only visible by the owner and the person present in the smart contract. This novel combination of smart contracts with proxy re-encryption provides an efficient, fast and secure platform for storing, trading and managing of sensor data.

Remote attestation is a well-known technique to detect cyber threats by remotely verifying the internal state of a networked embedded device through a trusted entity. Multi-device attestation has received little attention although current single-device approaches show limited scalability in IoT applications. Though recent work has yielded some proposals for scalable attestation, several aspects remain unexplored, and thus more research is required. This paper presents slimIoT, a scalable lightweight attestation protocol that is suitable for all IoT devices. slimIoT depends on an efficient broadcast authentication scheme along with symmetric key cryptography. It is resilient against a strong adversary with physical access to the IoT device. Our protocol is informative in the sense that it identifies the precise status of every device in the network. We implement and evaluate slimIoT considering many factors. On the one hand, our evaluation results show a low overhead in terms of memory footprint and runtime. On the other hand, simulations demonstrate that slimIoT is scalable, robust and highly efficient to be used in static and dynamic networks consisting of thousands of heterogenous IoT devices.",

Wether it is called fog1, edge or mist, the principle remains that cloud services must become available closer to clients. This documents presents ongoing work on future edge systems that are built to provide steadfast IoT services to users by bringing storage and processing power closer to peripheral parts of networks. Designing such infrastructures is becoming much more challenging as the number of IoT devices keeps growing. Production grade deployments have to meet very high performance requirements, and end-to-end solutions involve significant investments. In this paper, we aim at providing a solution to extend the range of the edge model to the very farthest nodes in the network. Specifically, we focus on providing reliable storage and computation capabilities immediately on wireless IoT sensor nodes. This extended edge model will allow end users to manage their IoT ecosystem without forcibly relying on gateways or Internet provider solutions. In this document, we introduce Achlys, a prototype implementation of an edge node that is a concrete port of the Lasp programming library on the GRiSP Erlang embedded system. This way, we aim at addressing the need for a general purpose edge that is both resilient and consistent in terms of storage and network. Finally, we study example use cases that could take advantage of integrating the Achlys framework and discuss future work for the latter.",

The capabilities of IoT also enable its important role in homeland security and tactical missions, including Reconnaissance, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RISTA). IoT security becomes the most critical issue before its extensive use in military operations. While the majority of research focuses on smart IoT devices, treatments for legacy dumb network-ready devices are lacking; moreover, IoT devices deployed in a hostile environment are often required to be dumb due to the strict hardware constraints, making them highly vulnerable to cyber attacks. To mitigate the problem, we propose a light-weight authentication scheme for dumb IoT devices, in a case study of the UAV-sensor collaborative RISTA missions. Our scheme utilizes the covert channels in the physical layer for authentications and does not request conventional key deployments, key generations which may cause security risks and large overhead that a dumb sensor cannot afford. Our scheme operates on the physical layer, and thus it is highly portable and generalizable to most commercial and military communication protocols. We demonstrate the viability of our scheme by building a prototype system and conducting experiments to emulate the behaviors of UAVs and sensors in real scenarios.",

The primary goals of NB-IoT are improved coverage, massive capacity, low cost, and long battery life. In order to improve coverage, NB-IoT has promising solutions, such as increasing transmission repetitions, decreasing bandwidth, and adapting the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS). In this paper, we present an implementation of coverage enhancement features of NB-IoT in NS-3, an end-to-end network simulator. The resource allocation and link adaptation in NS-3 are modified to comply with the new features of NB-IoT. Using the developed simulation framework, the influence of the new features on network reliability and latency is evaluated. Furthermore, an optimal hybrid link adaptation strategy based on all three features is proposed. To achieve this, we formulate an optimization problem that has an objective function based on latency, and constraint based on the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Then, we propose several algorithms to minimize latency and compare them with respect to accuracy and speed. The best hybrid solution is chosen and implemented in the NS-3 simulator by which the latency formulation is verified. The numerical results show that the proposed optimization algorithm for hybrid link adaptation is eight times faster than the exhaustive search approach and yields similar latency.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made it inevitable that their pertinence to digital forensic investigations will increase into the foreseeable future. These devices produced by various vendors often posses limited standard interfaces for communication, such as USB ports or WiFi/Bluetooth wireless interfaces. Meanwhile, with an increasing mainstream focus on the security and privacy of user data, built-in encryption is becoming commonplace in consumer-level computing devices, and IoT devices are no exception. Under these circumstances, a significant challenge is presented to digital forensic investigations where data from IoT devices needs to be analysed. This work explores the electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis literature for the purpose of assisting digital forensic investigations on IoT devices. EM side-channel analysis is a technique where unintentional electromagnetic emissions are used for eavesdropping on the operations and data handling of computing devices. The non-intrusive nature of EM side-channel approaches makes it a viable option to assist digital forensic investigations as these attacks require, and must result in, no modification to the target device. The literature on various EM side-channel analysis attack techniques are discussed - selected on the basis of their applicability in IoT device investigation scenarios. The insight gained from the background study is used to identify promising future applications of the technique for digital forensic analysis on IoT devices - potentially progressing a wide variety of currently hindered digital investigations.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of efficiently disseminating authenticated blockchain information from blockchain nodes (servers) to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, through a wireless base station (BS). In existing blockchain protocols, upon generation of a new block, each IoT device receives a copy of the block header, authenticated via digital signature by one or more trusted servers. Since it relies on unicast transmissions, the required communication resources grow linearly with the number of IoT devices. We propose a more efficient scheme, in which a single copy of each block header is multicasted, together with the signatures of servers. In addition, if IoT devices tolerate a delay, we exploit the blockchain structure to amortize the authentication in time, by transmitting only a subset of signature in each block period. Finally, the BS sends redundant information, via a repetition code, to deal with the unreliable wireless channel, with the aim of decreasing the amount of feedback required from IoT devices. Our analysis shows the trade-off between timely authentication of blocks and reliability of the communication, depending on the packet loss rate offered by the channel. The numerical results show that the performance benefits of the proposed scheme makes it a viable starting point for designing new lightweight protocols for blockchains.",

    "abstract": "Several IoT applications are tightly dependent on the locations of the devices. However, localization algorithms can be easily compromised by injecting false locations. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based secure localization algorithm for the Internet of Things (IoT). The algorithm uses a public ledger (Blockchain) that contains nodes position and the list of their neighbor nodes. This ledger is shared among the IoT devices. Once an IoT device is localized its new position and the list of neighbor nodes are added to the Blockchain. This shared localization data will be used later by other IoT devices for their localization process. To avoid the attack where a malicious node sends a fake position, the correctness of the claimed position are verified before adding it to the Blockchain. Moreover, data exchanged between nodes (IoT devices) are signed to guarantee their authenticity and integrity. The integration of these security mechanisms into the localization process permits to exclude false data and therefore reduces the localization error. The simulation results show that adding the proposed security mechanism improves the localization accuracy of the algorithm when running in the presence of malicious nodes.",

We focus on the user association problem, whose objective is to link each IoT device to an appropriate cellular user by maximizing the sum rate of all IoT devices. However, the difficulty in obtaining the full real-time channel information makes it difficult to design an optimal policy for this problem. To overcome this issue, we propose two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, both use the historical information to infer the current information in order to make appropriate decisions. One algorithm, centralized DRL, makes decisions for all IoT devices at one time with global information. The other algorithm, distributed DRL, makes a decision only for one IoT device at one time using local information. Finally, simulation results show that the two DRL algorithms achieve comparable performance as the optimal user association policy which requires perfect real-time information, and the distributed DRL algorithm has the advantage of scalability.",

However, due to the resource constraint of IoT devices and wireless network, both the communications and computation resources need to be allocated and scheduled efficiently for better system performance. In this paper, we propose a joint computation offloading and multi-user scheduling algorithm for IoT edge computing system to minimize the long-term average weighted sum of delay and power consumption under stochastic traffic arrival. We formulate the dynamic optimization problem as an infinite-horizon average-reward continuous-time Markov decision process (CTMDP) model. One critical challenge in solving this MDP problem for the multi-user resource control is the curse-of-dimensionality problem, where the state space of the MDP model and the computation complexity increase exponentially with the growing number of users or IoT devices. In order to overcome this challenge, we use the deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques and propose a neural network architecture to approximate the value functions for the post-decision system states. The designed algorithm to solve the CTMDP problem supports semi-distributed auction-based implementation, where the IoT devices submit bids to the BS to make the resource control decisions centrally. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides significant performance improvement over the baseline algorithms, and also outperforms the RL algorithms based on other neural network architectures.",

    "abstract": "Massive Internet of Things (IoT) is foreseen to introduce plethora of applications for a fully connected world. Heterogeneous traffic is envisaged, where packets generated at each IoT device should be differentiated and served according to their priority. This paper develops a novel priority-aware spatiotemporal mathematical model to characterize massive IoT networks with uplink prioritized multistream traffic (PMT). Particularly, stochastic geometry is utilized to account for the macroscopic network wide mutual interference between the coexisting IoT devices. Discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs) are employed to track the microscopic evolution of packets within each priority stream at each device. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality, we decompose the prioritized queueing model at each device to a single-queue system with server vacation. To this end, the IoT network with PMT is modeled as spatially interacting vacation queues. Interactions between queues, in terms of the packet departure probabilities, occur due to mutual interference. Service vacations occur to lower priority packets to address higher priority packets. Based on the proposed model, dedicated and shared channel access strategies for different priority classes are presented and compared. The results show that shared access provides better performance when considering the transmission success probability, queues overflow probability and latency.",

Such IoT devices are resource constrained and lack high-level security protocols. Thus, security becomes a major issue for such network systems. One way to secure the networks is through reliable authentication protocols and data transfer mechanism. As the household devices are controllable by the users remotely, they are accessed over the internet.

The framework captures the strategic interactions among APT attackers, IoT defenders, and cyber insurance insurers, and incorporates influence networks to assess the systemic cyber risks of interconnected IoT devices. The FlipIn framework formulates a game over networks within a principal-agent problem of moral-hazard type to design a cyber risk-aware insurance contract. We completely characterize the equilibrium solutions of the bi-level games for a network of distributed defenders and a semi-homogeneous centralized defender and show that the optimal insurance contracts cover half of the defenders' losses. Our framework predicts the risk compensation of defenders and the Peltzman effect of insurance. We study a centralized security management scenario and its decentralized counterpart, and leverage numerical experiments to show that network connectivity plays an important role in the security of the IoT devices and the insurability of both distributed and centralized defenders.",

More specifically, by stimulating the jammer to attack the channel through transmitting fake transmissions, the IoT system can not only undermine the jammer's power, but also harvest energy or utilize jamming signals as a communication means to transmit data through using RF energy harvesting and ambient backscatter techniques, respectively. Furthermore, we develop a low-cost deep reinforcement learning framework that enables the hardware-constrained IoT device to quickly obtain an optimal defense policy without requiring any information about the jammer in advance.

However, security remains as one of the paramount concern as many IoT devices are vulnerable. Moreover, IoT malware are constantly evolving and getting more sophisticated. IoT devices are intended to perform very specific tasks, so their networking behavior is expected to be reasonably stable and predictable. Any significant behavioral deviation from the normal patterns would indicate anomalous events. In this paper, we present a method to detect anomalous network communications in IoT networks using a set of sparse autoencoders. The proposed approach allows us to differentiate malicious communications from legitimate ones. So that, if a device is compromised only malicious communications can be dropped while the service provided by the device is not totally interrupted. To characterize network behavior, bidirectional TCP flows are extracted and described using statistics on the size of the first N packets sent and received, along with statistics on the corresponding inter-arrival times between packets. A set of sparse autoencoders is then trained to learn the profile of the legitimate communications generated by an experimental smart home network. Depending on the value of N, the developed model achieves attack detection rates ranging from 86.9% to 91.2%, and false positive rates ranging from 0.1% to 0.5%.",

To make cellular MIoT a reality, data transfer and control procedures specifically designed for the support of IoT are needed. For this reason, 3GPP has introduced the Control Plane Cellular IoT optimization, which foresees a simplified bearer instantiation, with the Mobility Management Entity (MME) handling both control and data traffic. The performance of the MME has therefore become critical, and properly scaling its computational capability can determine the ability of the whole network to tackle MIoT effectively. In particular, considering virtualized networks and the need for an efficient allocation of computing resources, it is paramount to characterize the MME performance as the MIoT traffic load changes. We address this need by presenting compact, closed-form expressions linking the number of IoT sources with the rate at which bearers are requested, and such a rate with the delay incurred by the IoT data. We show that our analysis, supported by testbed experiments and verified through large-scale simulations, represents a valuable tool to make effective scaling decisions in virtualized cellular core networks.",

However, IoT devices can barely afford complex DNN models due to limited computational power and energy supply. While one can offload anomaly detection tasks to the cloud, it incurs long delay and requires large bandwidth when thousands of IoT devices stream data to the cloud concurrently. In this paper, we propose an adaptive anomaly detection approach for hierarchical edge computing (HEC) systems to solve this problem. Specifically, we first construct three anomaly detection DNN models of increasing complexity, and associate them with the three layers of HEC from bottom to top, i.e., IoT devices, edge servers, and cloud. Then, we design an adaptive scheme to select one of the models based on the contextual information extracted from input data, to perform anomaly detection. The selection is formulated as a contextual bandit problem and is characterized by a single-step Markov decision process, with an objective of achieving high detection accuracy and low detection delay simultaneously. We evaluate our proposed approach using a real IoT dataset, and demonstrate that it reduces detection delay by 84% while maintaining almost the same accuracy as compared to offloading detection tasks to the cloud. In addition, our evaluation also shows that it outperforms other baseline schemes.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) is a trending topic in the computing world. Notably, IoT devices have strict design requirements and are often referred to as constrained devices. Therefore, security techniques and primitives that are lightweight are more suitable for such devices, e.g., Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). SRAM PUF is an intrinsic security primitive that is seeing widespread adoption in the IoT segment. ECC is a public-key algorithm technique that has been gaining popularity among constrained IoT devices. The popularity is due to using significantly smaller operands when compared to other public-key techniques such as RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman). This paper shows the design, development, and evaluation of an application-specific secure communication architecture based on SRAM PUF technology and ECC for constrained IoT devices. More specifically, it introduces an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) public-key based cryptographic protocol that utilizes PUF-derived keys as the root-of-trust for silicon authentication. Also, it proposes a design of a modular hardware architecture that supports the protocol. Finally, to analyze the practicality as well as the feasibility of the proposed protocol, we demonstrate the solution by prototyping and verifying a protocol variant on the commercial Xilinx Zynq-7000 APSoC device.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies received a lot of attention recently for their applications in many domains. IoT domain is one of such applications, which can utilize cryptocur-rencies for micro payments without compromising their payment privacy. However, long confirmation times of transactions and relatively high fees hinder the adoption of cryptoccurency based micro-payments. The payment channel networks is one of the proposed solutions to address these issue where nodes establish payment channels among themselves without writing on blockchain. IoT devices can benefit from such payment networks as long as they are capable of sustaining their overhead. Payment channel networks pose unique characteristics as far as the routing problem is concerned. Specifically, they should stay balanced to have a sustainable network for maintaining payments for longer times, which is crucial for IoT devices once they are deployed.In this paper, we present a payment channel network design that aims to keep the channels balanced by using a common weight policy across the network. We additionally propose using multi-point connections to nodes for each IoT device for unbalanced payment scenarios. The experiment results show that we can keep the channels in the network more equally balanced compared to the minimal fee approach. In addition, multiple connections from IoT devices to nodes increase the success ratio significantly.",

    "abstract": "We consider a system model comprised of an access point (AP) and K Internet of Things (IoT) nodes that sporadically become active in order to send data to the AP. The AP is assumed to have N time-frequency resource blocks that it can allocate to the IoT nodes that wish to send data, where N < K. The main problem is how to allocate the N time-frequency resource blocks to the IoT nodes in each time slot such that the average packet rate is maximized. For this problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-aided random access (RA) scheme, where an intelligent DRL agent at the AP learns to predict the activity of the IoT nodes in each time slot and grants time-frequency resource blocks to the IoT nodes predicted as active. Next, the IoT nodes that are missclassified as non-active by the DRL agent, as well as unseen or newly arrived nodes in the cell, employ the standard RA scheme in order to obtain time-frequency resource blocks. We leverage expert knowledge for faster training of the DRL agent. Our numerical results show significant improvements in terms of average packet rate when the proposed DRL-aided RA scheme is implemented compared to the existing solution used in practice, the standard RA scheme.",

To unleash its full potential, end-devices are expected to work in a plug and play fashion, with zero or minimal parameters configuration, still exhibiting excellent energy efficiency. We perform the most comprehensive set of empirical measurements with commercial IoT devices and different operators to date, quantifying the impact of several parameters to energy consumption. Our campaign proves that parameters setting does impact energy consumption, so proper configuration is necessary. We shed light on this aspect by first illustrating how the nominal standard operational modes map into real current consumption patterns of NB-IoT devices. Further, we investigate which device reported metadata metrics better reflect performance and implement an algorithm to automatically identify device state in current time series logs. Then, we provide a measurement-driven analysis of the energy consumption and network performance of two popular NB-IoT boards under different parameter configurations and with two major western European operators. We observed that energy consumption is mostly affected by the paging interval in Connected state, set by the base station. However, not all operators correctly implement such settings. Furthermore, under the default configuration, energy consumption in not strongly affected by packet size nor by signal quality, unless it is extremely bad. Our observations indicate that simple modifications to the default parameters settings can yield great energy savings.",

We explore not the failure to follow best practices, but rather a surprising lack of understanding, and void in the literature, on what (generically) \"best practice\" means, independent of meaningfully identifying specific individual practices. Confusion is evident from guidelines that conflate desired outcomes with security practices to achieve those outcomes. How do best practices, good practices, and standard practices differ? Or guidelines, recommendations, and requirements? Can something be a best practice if it is not actionable? We consider categories of best practices, and how they apply over the lifecycle of IoT devices. For concreteness in our discussion, we analyze and categorize a set of 1014 IoT security best practices, recommendations, and guidelines from industrial, government, and academic sources. As one example result, we find that about 70\\% of these practices or guidelines relate to early IoT device lifecycle stages, highlighting the critical position of manufacturers in addressing the security issues in question. We hope that our work provides a basis for the community to build on in order to better understand best practices, identify and reach consensus on specific practices, and then find ways to motivate relevant stakeholders to follow them.",

    "abstract": "Resource constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are highly likely to be compromised by attackers because strong security protections may not be suitable to be deployed. This requires an alternative approach to protect vulnerable components in IoT networks. In this paper, we propose an integrated defense technique to achieve intrusion prevention by leveraging cyberdeception (i.e., a decoy system) and moving target defense (i.e., network topology shuffling). We verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed technique analytically based on a graphical security model in a software defined networking (SDN)-based IoT network. We develop four strategies (i.e., fixed/random and adaptive/hybrid) to address \"when\" to perform network topology shuffling and three strategies (i.e., genetic algorithm/decoy attack path-based optimization/random) to address \"how\" to perform network topology shuffling on a decoy-populated IoT network, and analyze which strategy can best achieve a system goal such as prolonging the system lifetime, maximizing deception effectiveness, maximizing service availability, or minimizing defense cost. Our results demonstrate that a software defined IoT network running our intrusion prevention technique at the optimal parameter setting prolongs system lifetime, increases attack complexity of compromising critical nodes, and maintains superior service availability compared with a counterpart IoT network without running our intrusion prevention technique. Further, when given a single goal or a multi-objective goal (e.g., maximizing the system lifetime and service availability while minimizing the defense cost) as input, the best combination of \"how\" and \"how\" strategies is identified for executing our proposed technique under which the specified goal can be best achieved.",

These issues include facilitating secure transactions between IoT devices and immutably recording data. Most DLT architectures were not designed with IoT in mind and consequentially do not satisfy the requirements of many IoT applications. However, the relatively new class of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based DLTs show great promise for IoT networks. These DLTs require the rate at which transactions are issued and disseminated to be explicitly managed in order to ensure fairness among users. We present a congestion control algorithm for these DLTs, which optimises dissemination rate and guarantees that all nodes receive the same information and have fair access even in a dishonest environment, subject to the computing limitations of nodes. Our algorithm takes inspiration from well-known areas of networking research, such as QoS, and TCP. However, an important distinction between the DLT setting and traditional networks is the unique nature of traffic in DLT networks and the fact that nodes cannot trust familiar feedback measurements, such as packet acknowledgements or congestion notifications. Our solution realises a decentralised congestion control algorithm for DLTs without the need for trust among nodes.",

Specifically, we constructed a low-power mesh network with LoRa, a physical-layer standard that can provide long-range (kilometers) point-to-point communication using custom time-division multiple access (TDMA). Furthermore, we extended the capabilities of the mesh network by enabling ANT, an ultra-low-power, short-range communication protocol to satisfy data collection in dense device deployments. Third, we demonstrate the performance of the hybrid network with two real-world deployments at the Purdue University campus and at the university-owned farm. The results suggest that both networks have superior advantages in terms of cost, coverage, and power consumption vis-\\`a-vis other IoT solutions, like LoRaWAN.",

To maximise the average performance of sum rates, this work designs an efficient optimization approach based on two reinforcement learning algorithms, namely deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and SARSA-learning. For light traffic, SARSA-learning is used to explore the safest resource allocation policy with low cost. For heavy traffic, DRL is used to handle traffic-introduced huge variables. With the aid of the considered approach, this work addresses two main problems of the fair resource allocation in NOMA techniques: 1) allocating users dynamically and 2) balancing resource blocks and network traffic. We analytically demonstrate that the rate of convergence is inversely proportional to network sizes.

Subsequently, the closedform expressions of the ergodic secrecy capacities for the considered scenario are provided and, then, validated through extensive simulations. The results indicate that an error ceiling appears due to imperfect channel estimation at high values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). More importantly, the secrecy capacity under different channel conditions stops increasing beyond a certain limit, despite an increase of the main link SNR. The in-depth analysis of secrecy-energy trade-off has also been performed and a comparison has been provided for imperfect and perfect channel estimation cases.

The sharp rise of usage in Internet of Things (IoT) devices has imposed new challenges in device identification due to a wide variety of devices, protocols and control interfaces. In a network, conventional IoT devices identify each other by utilizing IP or MAC addresses, which are prone to spoofing. Moreover, IoT devices are low power devices with minimal embedded security solution. To mitigate the issue in IoT devices, fingerprint (DFP) for device identification can be used. DFP identifies a device by using implicit identifiers, such as network traffic (or packets), radio signal, which a device used for its communication over the network. These identifiers are closely related to the device hardware and software features. In this paper, we exploit TCP/IP packet header features to create a device fingerprint utilizing device originated network packets. We present a set of three metrics which separate some features from a packet which contribute actively for device identification. To evaluate our approach, we used publicly accessible two datasets. We observed the accuracy of device genre classification 99.37% and 83.35% of accuracy in the identification of an individual device from IoT Sentinel dataset.

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices are rapidly becoming universal. The success of IoT cannot be ignored in the scenario today, along with its attacks and threats on IoT devices and facilities are also increasing day by day. Cyber attacks become a part of IoT and affecting the life and society of users, so steps must be taken to defend cyber seriously. Cybercrimes threaten the infrastructure of governments and businesses globally and can damage the users in innumerable ways. With the global cybercrime damages predicted to cost up to 6 trillion dollars annually on the global economy by cyber crime. Estimated of 328 Million Dollar annual losses with the cyber attacks in Australia itself. Various steps are taken to slow down these attacks but unfortunately not able to achieve success properly. Therefor secure IoT is the need of this time and understanding of attacks and threats in IoT structure should be studied. The reasons for cyber-attacks can be Countries having week cyber securities, Cybercriminals use new technologies to attack, Cybercrime is possible with services and other business schemes. MSP (Managed Service Providers) face different difficulties in fighting with Cyber-crime. They have to ensure that security of the customer as well as their security in terms of their servers, devices, and systems. Hence, they must use effective, fast, and easily usable antivirus and antimalware tools.",

In recent years the Internet of Things (IoT) has incredibly become a groundbreaking technical innovation that has contributed to massive impact in the ways where all the information is handled incorporate companies, computer devices, and even kitchen equipment and appliances, are designed and made. The main focus of this chapter is to systematically review the security and privacy of the Internet of Things in the present world. Most internet users are genuine, yet others are cybercriminals with individual expectations of misusing information. With such possibilities, users should know the potential security and privacy issues of IoT devices. IoT innovations are applied on numerous levels in a system that we use daily in our day-to-day life. Data confidentiality is a significant issue. The interconnection of various networks makes it impossible for users to assert extensive control of their data. Finally, this chapter discusses the IoT Security concerns in the literature and providing a critical review of the current approach and proposed solutions on present issues on the Privacy protection of IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "As a result of the worldwide transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an unprecedented pandemic. Currently, with unavailable pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines, this novel coronavirus results in a great impact on public health, human society, and global economy, which is likely to last for many years. One of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that a long-term system with non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing and controlling new infectious diseases is desirable to be implemented. Internet of things (IoT) platform is preferred to be utilized to achieve this goal, due to its ubiquitous sensing ability and seamless connectivity. IoT technology is changing our lives through smart healthcare, smart home, and smart city, which aims to build a more convenient and intelligent community. This paper presents how the IoT could be incorporated into the epidemic prevention and control system. Specifically, we demonstrate a potential fog-cloud combined IoT platform that can be used in the systematic and intelligent COVID-19 prevention and control, which involves five interventions including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring, Contact Tracing & Social Distancing, COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking. We investigate and review the state-of-the-art literatures of these five interventions to present the capabilities of IoT in countering against the current COVID-19 pandemic or future infectious disease epidemics.",

    "abstract": "Negative environmental impacts on societies and ecosystems are frequently driven by human activity and amplified by increasing climatic variability. Properly managing these impacts relies on a government's ability to ensure environmental regulatory compliance in the face of increasing uncertainty. Water flow rates are the most widely used evaluation metric for river regulatory compliance. Specifically, compliance thresholds are set by calculating the minimum flow rates required by aquatic species such as fish. These are then designated as the minimum \"environmental flows\" (eflows) for each river. In this paper, we explore how IoT-generated open government data can be used to enhance the development of an automated IoT-based eflows compliance system. To reduce development and operational costs, the proposed solution relies on routinely collected river monitoring data. Our approach allows for any authority with similar data to rapidly develop, test and verify a scalable solution for eflow regulatory compliance monitoring and evaluation. Furthermore, we demonstrate a real-world application of our system using open government data from Estonia's national river monitoring network. The main novelty of this work is that the proposed IoT-based system provides a simple evaluation tool that re-purposes IoT-generated open government data to evaluate compliance and improve monitoring at a national scale. This work showcases a new paradigm of IoT-based solutions using open government data and provides a real-world example of how the solution can automatically evaluate environmental compliance in increasingly uncertain environments.",

However, a critical issue of IoT sensing is that data are usually transient, which necessitates temporal updates of caching content items while frequent cache updates could lead to considerable energy cost and challenge the lifetime of IoT sensors. To address this issue, we adopt the Age of Information (AoI) to quantify data freshness and propose an online cache update scheme to obtain an effective tradeoff between the average AoI and energy cost. Specifically, we first develop a characterization of transmission energy consumption at IoT sensors by incorporating a successful transmission condition. Then, we model cache updating as a Markov decision process to minimize average weighted cost with judicious definitions of state, action, and reward. Since user preference towards content items is usually unknown and often temporally evolving, we therefore develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to enable intelligent cache updates. Through trial-and-error explorations, an effective caching policy can be learned without requiring exact knowledge of content popularity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "The upcoming Internet of things (IoT) is foreseen to encompass massive numbers of connected devices, smart objects, and cyber-physical systems. Due to the large-scale and massive deployment of devices, it is deemed infeasible to safeguard 100% of the devices with state-of-the-art security countermeasures. Hence, large-scale IoT has inevitable loopholes for network intrusion and malware infiltration. Even worse, exploiting the high density of devices and direct wireless connectivity, malware infection can stealthily propagate through susceptible (i.e., unsecured) devices and form an epidemic outbreak without being noticed to security administration. A malware outbreak enables adversaries to compromise large population of devices, which can be exploited to launch versatile cyber and physical malicious attacks. In this context, we utilize spatial firewalls, to safeguard the IoT from malware outbreak. In particular, spatial firewalls are computationally capable devices equipped with state-of-the-art security and anti-malware programs that are spatially deployed across the network to filter the wireless traffic in order to detect and thwart malware propagation. Using tools from percolation theory, we prove that there exists a critical density of spatial firewalls beyond which malware outbreak is impossible. This, in turns, safeguards the IoT from malware epidemics regardless of the infection/treatment rates. To this end, a tractable upper bound for the critical density of spatial firewalls is obtained. Furthermore, we characterize the relative communications ranges of the spatial firewalls and IoT devices to ensure secure network connectivity. The percentage of devices secured by the firewalls is also characterized.",

This requires robustly identifying devices so that appropriate network security policies can be applied. We address this challenge by exploring how to accurately identify IoT devices based on their network behavior, using resources available at the edge of the network. In this paper, we compare the accuracy of five different machine learning models (tree-based and neural network-based) for identifying IoT devices by using packet trace data from a large IoT test-bed, showing that all models need to be updated over time to avoid significant degradation in accuracy. In order to effectively update the models, we find that it is necessary to use data gathered from the deployment environment, e.g., the household. We therefore evaluate our approach using hardware resources and data sources representative of those that would be available at the edge of the network, such as in an IoT deployment. We show that updating neural network-based models at the edge is feasible, as they require low computational and memory resources and their structure is amenable to being updated. Our results show that it is possible to achieve device identification and categorization with over 80% and 90% accuracy respectively at the edge.",

However, extremely small memory and low-energy budgets have so far prevented wide use of VMs on typical microcontroller-based IoT devices. In this paper, we explore the potential of two minimal VM approaches on such low-power hardware. We design rBPF, a register-based VM based on extended Berkeley Packet Filters (eBPF). We compare it with a stack-based VM based on WebAssembly (Wasm) adapted for embedded systems. We implement prototypes of each VM, hosted in the IoT operating system RIOT. We perform measurements on commercial off-the-shelf IoT hardware. Unsurprisingly, we observe that both Wasm and rBPF virtual machines yield execution time and memory overhead, compared to not using a VM. We show however that this execution time overhead is tolerable for low-throughput, low-energy IoT devices. We further show that, while using a VM based on Wasm entails doubling the memory budget for a simple networked IoT application using a 6LoWPAN/CoAP stack, using a VM based on rBPF requires only negligible memory overhead (less than 10% more memory). rBPF is thus a promising approach to host small software modules, isolated from OS software, and updatable on-demand, over low-power networks.",

    "abstract": "Due to the wide adoption of IoT/CPS systems, embedded devices(IoT frontends) become increasingly connected and mission-critical, which in turn has attracted advanced attacks (e.g., control-flow hijacks and data-only attacks). Unfortunately, IoT backends are unable to detect if such attacks have happened while receiving data, service requests, or operation status from IoT devices. As a result, currently, IoT backends are forced to blindly trust the IoT devices that they interact with. To fill this void, we first formulate a new security property for embedded devices, called \"Operation Execution Integrity\" or OEI. We then design and build a system, OAT, that enables remote OEI attestation for ARM-based bare-metal embedded devices. Our formulation of OEI captures the integrity of both control flow and critical data involved in an operation execution. Therefore, satisfying OEI entails that an operation execution is free of unexpected control and data manipulations, which existing attestation methods cannot check. Our design of OAT strikes a balance between prover's constraints (embedded devices' limited computing power and storage) and verifier's requirements(complete verifiability and forensic assistance). OAT uses a new control-flow measurement scheme, which enables light-weight and space-efficient collection of measurements (97% space reduction from the trace-based approach). OAT performs the remote control-flow verification through abstract execution, which is fast and deterministic. OAT also features lightweight integrity checking for critical data (74% fewer instrumentation needed than previous work). Our security analysis shows that OAT allows remote verifiers or IoT backends to detect both control-flow hijacks and data-only attacks that affect the execution of operations on IoT devices. In our evaluation using real embedded programs, OAT incurs a runtime overhead of 2.7%.",

    "abstract": "The effective operation of time-critical Internet of things (IoT) applications requires real-time reporting of fresh status information of underlying physical processes. In this paper, a real-time IoT monitoring system is considered, in which the IoT devices sample a physical process with a sampling cost and send the status packet to a given destination with an updating cost. This joint status sampling and updating process is designed to minimize the average age of information (AoI) at the destination node under an average energy cost constraint at each device. This is formulated as an infinite horizon average cost constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and transformed into an unconstrained MDP using a Lagrangian method. For the single IoT device case, the optimal policy for the CMDP is shown to be a randomized mixture of two deterministic policies for the unconstrained MDP, which is of threshold type. Then, a structure-aware optimal algorithm to obtain the optimal policy of the CMDP is proposed and the impact of the wireless channel dynamics is studied while demonstrating that channels having a larger mean channel gain and less scattering can achieve better AoI performance. For the case of multiple IoT devices, a low-complexity distributed suboptimal policy is proposed with the updating control at the destination and the sampling control at each device. Then, an online learning algorithm is developed to obtain this policy, which can be implemented at each IoT device and requires only the local knowledge and small signaling from the destination. The proposed learning algorithm is shown to converge almost surely to the suboptimal policy. Simulation results show the structural properties of the optimal policy for the single IoT device case; and show that the proposed policy for multiple IoT devices outperforms a zero-wait baseline policy, with average AoI reductions reaching up to 33%.",

In this network, the IoT task processing requests are served by peers. The peers in our work are represented by IoT objects and relays that host virtual machines (VMs). We have considered three scenarios to investigate the saving in power consumption and the system capabilities in terms of task processing. The first scenario is the relays only scenario, where the task requests are processed using relays only. The second scenario is the objects only scenario, where the task requests are processed using the IoT objects only. The last scenario is a hybrid scenario, where the task requests are processed using both IoT objects and VMs. We have developed a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to maximize the number of processing tasks served by the system and minimize the total power consumed by the IoT network. We investigated our framework under the impact of VMs placement constraints, fairness constraints between the objects, tasks number limitations, uplink and downlink limited capacities, and processing capability limitations. Based on the MILP model principles, we developed an energy efficient virtualized IoT P2P networks heuristic (EEVIPN). The heuristic results were comparable to those of the MILP in terms of energy efficiency and tasks processing. Our results show that the hybrid scenario serves up to 77% (57% on average) processing task requests, but with higher energy consumption compared to the other scenarios. The relays only scenario can serve 74% (57% on average) of the processing task requests with 8% saving in power consumption compared to the hybrid scenario. In contrast, 28% (22% on average) of task requests can be successfully handled by applying the objects only scenario with up to 62% power saving compared to the hybrid scenario.",

    "abstract": "Security is one of the fundamental challenges in the Internet of Things (IoT) due to the heterogeneity and resource constraints of the IoT devices. Device classification methods are employed to enhance the security of IoT by detecting unregistered devices or traffic patterns. In recent years, blockchain has received tremendous attention as a distributed trustless platform to enhance the security of IoT. Conventional device identification methods are not directly applicable in blockchain-based IoT as network layer packets are not stored in the blockchain. Moreover, the transactions are broadcast and thus have no destination IP address and contain a public key as the user identity, and are stored permanently in blockchain which can be read by any entity in the network. We show that device identification in blockchain introduces privacy risks as the malicious nodes can identify users' activity pattern by analyzing the temporal pattern of their transactions in the blockchain. We study the likelihood of classifying IoT devices by analyzing their information stored in the blockchain, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first work of its kind. We use a smart home as a representative IoT scenario. First, a blockchain is populated according to a real-world smart home traffic dataset. We then apply machine learning algorithms on the data stored in the blockchain to analyze the success rate of device classification, modeling both an informed and a blind attacker. Our results demonstrate success rates over 90\\% in classifying devices. We propose three timestamp obfuscation methods, namely combining multiple packets into a single transaction, merging ledgers of multiple devices, and randomly delaying transactions, to reduce the success rate in classifying devices. The proposed timestamp obfuscation methods can reduce the classification success rates to as low as 20%.",

    "abstract": "Supporting convolutional neural network (CNN) inference on resource-constrained IoT devices in a timely manner has been an outstanding challenge for emerging smart systems. To mitigate the burden on IoT devices, the prevailing solution is to offload the CNN inference task, which is usually composed of billions of operations, to public cloud. However, the \"offloading-to-cloud\" solution may cause privacy breach while moving sensitive data to cloud. For privacy protection, the research community has resorted to advanced cryptographic primitives and approximation techniques to support CNN inference on encrypted data. Consequently, these attempts cause impractical computational overhead on IoT devices and degrade the performance of CNNs. Moreover, relying on the remote cloud can cause additional network latency and even make the system dysfunction when network connection is off. We proposes an extremely lightweight edge device assisted private CNN inference solution for IoT devices, namely LEP-CNN. The main design of LEP-CNN is based on a novel online/offline encryption scheme. The decryption of LEP-CNN is pre-computed offline via utilizing the linear property of the most time-consuming operations of CNNs. As a result, LEP-CNN allows IoT devices to securely offload over 99% CNN operations, and edge devices to execute CNN inference on encrypted data as efficient as on plaintext. LEP-CNN also provides an integrity check option to help IoT devices detect error results with a successful rate over 99%. Experiments on AlexNet show that LEP-CNN can speed up the CNN inference for more than 35 times for resource constrained IoT devices. A homomorphic encryption based AlexNet using CryptoNets is implemented to compare with LEP-CNN to demonstrate that LEP-CNN has a better performance than homomorphic encryption based privacy preserving neural networks under time-sensitive scenarios.",

For this reason, techniques such as spectrum sharing, dynamic spectrum access, extraction of signal intelligence and optimized routing will soon become essential components of the IoT wireless communication paradigm. Given that the majority of the IoT will be composed of tiny, mobile, and energy-constrained devices, traditional techniques based on a priori network optimization may not be suitable, since (i) an accurate model of the environment may not be readily available in practical scenarios; (ii) the computational requirements of traditional optimization techniques may prove unbearable for IoT devices. To address the above challenges, much research has been devoted to exploring the use of machine learning to address problems in the IoT wireless communications domain. This work provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in the application of machine learning techniques to address key problems in IoT wireless communications with an emphasis on its ad hoc networking aspect. First, we present extensive background notions of machine learning techniques. Then, by adopting a bottom-up approach, we examine existing work on machine learning for the IoT at the physical, data-link and network layer of the protocol stack. Thereafter, we discuss directions taken by the community towards hardware implementation to ensure the feasibility of these techniques. Additionally, before concluding, we also provide a brief discussion of the application of machine learning in IoT beyond wireless communication.

    "abstract": "Massive MIMO is considered to be one of the key technologies in the emerging 5G systems, but also a concept applicable to other wireless systems. Exploiting the large number of degrees of freedom (DoFs) of massive MIMO essential for achieving high spectral efficiency, high data rates and extreme spatial multiplexing of densely distributed users. On the one hand, the benefits of applying massive MIMO for broadband communication are well known and there has been a large body of research on designing communication schemes to support high rates. On the other hand, using massive MIMO for Internet-of-Things (IoT) is still a developing topic, as IoT connectivity has requirements and constraints that are significantly different from the broadband connections. In this paper we investigate the applicability of massive MIMO to IoT connectivity. Specifically, we treat the two generic types of IoT connections envisioned in 5G: massive machine-type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). This paper fills this important gap by identifying the opportunities and challenges in exploiting massive MIMO for IoT connectivity. We provide insights into the trade-offs that emerge when massive MIMO is applied to mMTC or URLLC and present a number of suitable communication schemes. The discussion continues to the questions of network slicing of the wireless resources and the use of massive MIMO to simultaneously support IoT connections with very heterogeneous requirements. The main conclusion is that massive MIMO can bring benefits to the scenarios with IoT connectivity, but it requires tight integration of the physical-layer techniques with the protocol design.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning finds rich applications in Internet of Things (IoT) networks such as information retrieval, traffic management, spectrum sensing, and signal authentication. While there is a surge of interest to understand the security issues of machine learning, their implications have not been understood yet for wireless applications such as those in IoT systems that are susceptible to various attacks due the open and broadcast nature of wireless communications. To support IoT systems with heterogeneous devices of different priorities, we present new techniques built upon adversarial machine learning and apply them to three types of over-the-air (OTA) wireless attacks, namely jamming, spectrum poisoning, and priority violation attacks. By observing the spectrum, the adversary starts with an exploratory attack to infer the channel access algorithm of an IoT transmitter by building a deep neural network classifier that predicts the transmission outcomes. Based on these prediction results, the wireless attack continues to either jam data transmissions or manipulate sensing results over the air (by transmitting during the sensing phase) to fool the transmitter into making wrong transmit decisions in the test phase (corresponding to an evasion attack). When the IoT transmitter collects sensing results as training data to retrain its channel access algorithm, the adversary launches a causative attack to manipulate the input data to the transmitter over the air. We show that these attacks with different levels of energy consumption and stealthiness lead to significant loss in throughput and success ratio in wireless communications for IoT systems. Then we introduce a defense mechanism that systematically increases the uncertainty of the adversary at the inference stage and improves the performance. Results provide new insights on how to attack and defend IoT networks using deep learning.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a real-time Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system is considered in which multiple IoT devices must transmit timely updates on the status information of a common underlying physical process to a common destination. In particular, a real-world IoT scenario is considered in which multiple (partially) observed status information by different IoT devices are required at the destination, so that the real-time status of the physical process can be properly re-constructed. By taking into account such correlated status information at the IoT devices, the problem of IoT device scheduling is studied in order to jointly minimize the average age of information (AoI) at the destination and the average energy cost at the IoT devices. Particularly, two types of IoT devices are considered: Type-I devices whose status updates randomly arrive and type-II devices whose status updates can be generated-at-will with an associated sampling cost. This stochastic problem is formulated as an infinite horizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP). The optimal scheduling policy is shown to be threshold-based with respect to the AoI at the destination, and the threshold is non-increasing with the channel condition of each device. For a special case in which all devices are type-II, the original MDP can be reduced to an MDP with much smaller state and action spaces. The optimal policy is further shown to have a similar threshold-based structure and the threshold is non-decreasing with an energy cost function of the devices. Simulation results illustrate the structure of the optimal policy and show the effectiveness of the optimal policy compared with a myopic baseline policy.",

    "abstract": "Security and privacy of the users have become significant concerns due to the involvement of the Internet of things (IoT) devices in numerous applications. Cyber threats are growing at an explosive pace making the existing security and privacy measures inadequate. Hence, everyone on the Internet is a product for hackers. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to produce accurate outputs from large complex databases, where the generated outputs can be used to predict and detect vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems. Furthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming popular in modern IoT applications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years addressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques. In this paper, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, starting from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BCtechniques in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported in the past twelve years in the IoT domain. Then, we classify the literature on security and privacy efforts based on ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. Finally, we identify and illuminate several challenges and future research directions in using ML algorithms and BC techniques to address security and privacy issues in the IoT domain.",

    "abstract": "Recent trend of railway train development can be characterized in several aspects : high speed, infortainment, intelligence in driving, and so on. In particular, trend of high speed in driving is prominent and competition for high speed amongst several techno-savvy countries is becoming severe. To achieve high speed, engines or motors are distributed over multiple vehicles of train to provide increased motive power, while a single engine or motor has been mostly used for conventional trains. Increased speed and more complicated powertrain system naturally incur much higher chance of massive accidents. From this perspective, importance of proactive safety control before accident takes place cannot be over-emphasized. To implement proactive safety control requires situation-aware integration and transmission of safety information obtained from IoT sensors. Types of critical IoT sensors depend on situational conditions. Thus, integration and transmission of safety information should be performed with IoT sensors providing the safety information proper for faced situation. This brief paper is to devise a methodology how to operate IoT sensor network enabling proactive safety control for railway vehicles and to propose a queue management based medium access control scheme.",

In this context, a greedy approximation scheme Bee is proposed, which resolves aforementioned sub-problems with five consecutive models, namely Maverick, Siren, Pigmy, Arkeo and Augeas, respectively. Theoretical analysis justifies the problem as NP-hard, combinatorial optimization problem, which is amenable to greedy approximation. Moreover, Bee lays out the theoretical foundation of Resilient Fact-finding, followed by theoretical and experimental(i.e synthetic) proof, which show how Bee-resilience resolves acute CDS measurement problem. Accordingly, experiments on real Social rumor dataset extract dominator and dominate to justify how Bee resilience improves CDS measurement.

Auto-correlation detectors show low computational complexity from a signal processing point of view at the price of a higher detection latency. In contrast a maximum likelihood cross-correlation detector achieves low latency at a higher complexity as shown in this paper. We present a hardware implementation of the maximum likelihood cross-correlation detection. The detector achieves an average detection latency which is a factor of two below that of an auto-correlation method and is able to reduce the required energy per timing acquisition by up to 34%.",

    "abstract": "Sufficiently strong security and privacy mechanisms are prerequisite to amass the promising benefits of the IoT technology and to incorporate this technology into our daily lives. This paper introduces a novel approach to privacy in networks, an approach which is especially well matched with the IoT characteristics. Our general approach is based on continually changing the identifying attributes of IoT nodes. In particular, the scheme proposed in this work is based on changing the IoT nodes' IP addresses, and because the changing patterns of the IP addresses appear random to a non-intended observer, an adversary is unable to identify the source or destination of a particular transmission. Thus, packets that carry information generated by a particular node cannot be linked together. The scheme offers additional security benefits, including DoS mitigation, is relatively easy to implement, and requires no changes to the existing networking infrastructure. We discuss the details of the implementation of the scheme and evaluate its performance.",

The pervasive IoT devices are encouraged to share data with each other in order to better serve the users. However, users are reluctant to share sensitive data due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we study the anonymous data aggregation for the IoT system, in which the IoT company servers, though not fully trustworthy, are used to assist the aggregation. We propose an efficient and accountable aggregation scheme that can preserve the data anonymity. We analyze the communication and computation overheads of the proposed scheme, and evaluate the total execution time and the per-user communication overhead with extensive simulations. The results show that our scheme is more efficient than the previous peer-shuffle protocol, especially for data aggregation from multiple providers.",

We analyze the use cases of scheduled periodic and unscheduled traffic under varying loads. Our findings indicate that (a) NDN admits the most resource-friendly deployment on nodes, and (b) shows superior robustness and resilience in multi-hop scenarios, while (c) the IP protocols operate at less overhead and higher speed in single-hop deployments. Most strikingly we find that NDN-based protocols are in significantly better flow balance than the UDP-based IP protocols and require less corrective actions.",

But with the rapid growth in services and applications, it is vulnerable to possible attacks and faces severe security challenges. Intrusion detection has been widely used to ensure network security, but classical detection means are usually signature-based or explicit-behavior-based and fail to detect unknown attacks intelligently, which are hard to satisfy the requirements of SD-IoT Networks. In this paper, we propose an AI-based two-stage intrusion detection empowered by software defined technology. It flexibly captures network flows with a globle view and detects attacks intelligently through applying AI algorithms. We firstly leverage Bat algorithm with swarm division and Differential Mutation to select typical features. Then, we exploit Random forest through adaptively altering the weights of samples using weighted voting mechanism to classify flows. Evaluation results prove that the modified intelligent algorithms select more important features and achieve superior performance in flow classification. It is also verified that intelligent intrusion detection shows better accuracy with lower overhead comparied with existing solutions.",

PIANO leverages the built-in speaker, microphone, and Bluetooth that voice-powered IoT devices often already have. Specifically, we assume that a user carries a personal voice-powered device (e.g., smartphone, smartwatch, or smartglass), which serves as the user's identity. When another voice-powered IoT device of the user requires authentication, PIANO estimates the distance between the two devices by playing and detecting certain acoustic signals; PIANO grants access if the estimated distance is no larger than a user-selected threshold. We implemented a proof-of-concept prototype of PIANO. Through theoretical and empirical evaluations, we find that PIANO is secure, reliable, personalizable, and efficient.",

    "abstract": "The efficient deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) over cellular networks, such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) or the next generation 5G, entails several challenges. For massive IoT, reducing the energy consumption on the device side becomes essential. One of the main characteristics of massive IoT is small data transmissions. To improve the support of them, the 3GPP has included two novel optimizations in LTE: one of them based on the Control Plane (CP), and the other on the User Plane (UP). In this paper, we analyze the average energy consumption per data packet using these two optimizations compared to conventional LTE Service Request procedure. We propose an analytical model to calculate the energy consumption for each procedure based on a Markov chain. In the considered scenario, for large and small Inter-Arrival Times (IATs), the results of the three procedures are similar. While for medium IATs CP reduces the energy consumption per packet up to 87% due to its connection release optimization.",

One of the important sources for scientific big data is the datasets collected by Internet of things (IoT). It's considered that these datesets contain highly useful and valuable information. For an IoT application to analyze big sensor data, it is necessary that the data are clean and lossless. However, due to unreliable wireless link or hardware failure in the nodes, data loss in IoT is very common. To reconstruct the missing big sensor data, firstly, we propose an algorithm based on matrix rank-minimization method. Then, we consider IoT with multiple types of sensor in each node. Accounting for possible correlations among multiple-attribute sensor data, we propose tensor-based methods to estimate missing values. Moreover, effective solutions are proposed using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Finally, we evaluate the approaches using two real sensor datasets with two missing data-patterns, i.e., random missing pattern and consecutive missing pattern. The experiments with real-world sensor data show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

    "abstract": "The incredible growth of sensors and microcontroller units makes the task of real-time event monitoring in the Internet of Things (IoT) based applications easier and more practical. In order to effectively support the event management in IoT-based applications, we propose a framework that is based on the publish-subscribe model for detecting events from IoT sensor nodes and sending notifications to subscribers (end-users) via Internet, SMS, and Calling. With the exception of the advantages inherited from the publish-subscribe model, the further advantages of the proposed framework are the ease of use in terms of user configuration without any need of technical skills, the aid of security mechanisms to prevent network intrusion, and the minimum hardware resource requirement. Additionally, the proposed framework is applicable and adaptable to various platforms since it has been developed by using Boost C++ Libraries and CMake. To evaluate the proposed framework, we develop a prototype of a real-time event monitoring system that is also presented in this paper.",

More seriously, severe security deficiencies of these protocols become evident, as time-to- market is a key factor, which satisfaction comes at the price of a less thorough security design and testing. This applies especially to the smart home domain, where the consumer-driven market demands quick and cheap solutions. This paper presents an overview of IoT application domains and discusses the most important wireless IoT protocols for smart home, which are KNX-RF, EnOcean, Zigbee, Z-Wave and Thread. Finally, it describes the security features of said protocols and compares them with each other, giving advice on whose protocols are more suitable for a secure smart home.",

Cyber-physical systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Cloud computing, play a key role in the fourth industrial revolution known as Industry 4.0.

In this paper, we adopt the concept of microservice and describe a framework for manufacturing systems that has the cyber-physical microservice as the key construct. The manufacturing plant processes are defined as compositions of primitive cyber-physical microservices adopting either the orchestration or the choreography pattern. IoT technologies are used for system integration and model-driven engineering is utilized to semi-automate the development process for the industrial engineer, who is not familiar with microservices and IoT.

    "abstract": "IoT systems are growing larger and larger and are becoming suitable for basic automation tasks. One of the features IoT automation systems can provide is dealing with a dynamic system -- Devices leaving and joining the system during operation. Additionally, IoT automation systems operate in a decentralized manner. Current commercial automation systems have difficulty providing these features. Integrating new devices into an automation system takes manual intervention. Additionally, automation systems also require central entities to orchestrate the operation of participants. With smarter sensors and actors, we can move control operations into software deployed on a decentralized network of devices, and provide support for dynamic systems. In this paper, we present a framework for automation systems that demonstrates these two properties (distributed and dynamic). We represent applications as semantically described data flows that are run decentrally on participating devices, and connected at runtime via rules. This allows integrating new devices into applications without manual interaction and removes central controllers from the equation. This approach provides similar features to current automation systems (central engineering, multiple instantiation of applications), but enables distributed and dynamic operation. We demonstrate satisfying performance of the system via a quantitative evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Secure group-oriented communication is crucial to a wide range of applications in Internet of Things (IoT). Security problems related to group-oriented communications in IoT-based applications placed in a privacy-sensitive environment have become a major concern along with the development of the technology. Unfortunately, many IoT devices are designed to be portable and light-weight; thus, their functionalities, including security modules, are heavily constrained by the limited energy resources (e.g., battery capacity). To address these problems, we propose a group key management scheme based on a novel physically unclonable function (PUF) design: multistage interconnected PUF (MIPUF) to secure group communications in an energy-constrained environment. Our design is capable of performing key management tasks such as key distribution, key storage and rekeying securely and efficiently. We show that our design is secure against multiple attack methods and our experimental results show that our design saves 47.33% of energy globally comparing to state-of-the-art Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)-based key management scheme on average.",

Blockchain technology, even in today's nascent form, contains the pillars to create a common, distributed, trustless and autonomous infrastructure system. This paper describes a standardized IoT infrastructure; where data is stored on a DDOS-resistant, fault-tolerant, distributed storage service and data access is managed by a decentralized, trustless blockchain. The illustrated system used LoRa as the emerging network technology, Swarm as the distributed data storage and Ethereum as the blockchain platform. Such a data backend will ensure high availability with minimal security risks while replacing traditional backend systems with a single \"smart contract\".",

Security is often a secondary matter behind functionality and comfort, but the problem has already been recognized.

While these updates can be safely retrieved from app stores, the problems kick in via jailbroken devices and with the variety of untrusted sources arising on the internet. Since hacking is typically a community effort? these days, security could be a community goal too. The challenges are manifold, and one reason for weak or absent security on IoT devices is their weak computational power.

We discuss game-theoretic methods of community formation and light-weight cryptographic means to accomplish authentic software deployment inside the IoT device community.",

In this work we study the joint effects of data preprocessing and transmission procedures on information freshness measured by peak age of information (PAoI).

Then, we respectively derive the closed-form and an information theoretic approximation of the expectation of waiting time for the formulated processing queue and transmission queue, and further get the analytical expressions of the average PAoI for packages from different sources. Finally, the accuracy of our analysis is verified with simulation results.",

IOT concepts have been applied to various domains revolutionizing the way business processes are conducted. Health Informatics is a nascent multidisciplinary field that aims at applying information engineering concepts to healthcare. The information traditionally came from a variety of sources such as healthcare IT systems but recently is being stored in variety of IOT devices. Application of IOT concepts is becoming the norm giving rise to the Internet of Medical Things (IOMT). However, IOMT introduces many challenges such as the real-time nature, security, and privacy of data along with others. Thus, understanding the underlying structure of IOMT is of paramount importance. Given the importance of the underlying networks, we explore various solutions currently employed in developing the Personal Area Networks (PANs) that are the underlying cornerstone of IOMT). PANs allow the sensors to measure the change in various stimuli and transmit the information via LANs and WANs to various stakeholders. This chapter will look at three standards that are currently used by both academia and industry along with Body Area Networks (BANs). The chapter also provides a survey of prevalent IOMT applications along with various vendors that provide such services.",

    "abstract": "Thanks to rapid technological advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), a smart public safety (SPS) system has become feasible by integrating heterogeneous computing devices to collaboratively provide public protection services. While a service oriented architecture (SOA) has been adopted by IoT and cyber-physical systems (CPS), it is difficult for a monolithic architecture to provide scalable and extensible services for a distributed IoT based SPS system. Furthermore, traditional security solutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be a performance bottleneck or single point failure. Inspired by microservices architecture and blockchain technology, this paper proposes a BLockchain-ENabled Decentralized Microservices Architecture for Smart public safety (BlendMAS). Within a permissioned blockchain network, a microservices based security mechanism is introduced to secure data access control in an SPS system. The functionality of security services are decoupled into separate containerized microservices that are built using a smart contract, and deployed on edge and fog computing nodes. An extensive experimental study verified that the proposed BlendMAS is able to offer a decentralized, scalable and secured data sharing and access control to distributed IoT based SPS system.",

In this article, we discuss several spectrum sharing methods to address these intra- and inter-network sharing issues. To this end, we first consider ALOHA-based networks that avoid spectrum sensing, yet rely on diversity to improve connection density of random access. Then, we present sensing-based solutions such as unlicensed cellular access that help support a wider range of applications with different rate requirements and connection densities.

We present Pyronia, a fine-grained access control system for IoT applications written in high-level languages. Pyronia exploits developers' coarse-grained expectations about how imported third-party code operates to restrict access to files, devices, and specific network destinations, at the granularity of individual functions. To efficiently protect such sensitive OS resources, Pyronia combines three techniques: system call interposition, stack inspection, and memory domains. This design avoids the need for application refactoring, or unintuitive data flow analysis, while enforcing the developer's access policy at run time. Our Pyronia prototype for Python runs on a custom Linux kernel, and incurs moderate performance overhead on unmodified Python applications.",

    "abstract": "Efficient authentication is vital for IoT applications with stringent minimum-delay requirements (e.g., energy delivery systems). This requirement becomes even more crucial when the IoT devices are battery-powered, like small aerial drones, and the efficiency of authentication directly translates to more operation time. Although some fast authentication techniques have been proposed, some of them might not fully meet the needs of the emerging delay-aware IoT. In this paper, we propose a new signature scheme called ARIS that pushes the limits of the existing digital signatures, wherein commodity hardware can verify 83,333 signatures per second. ARIS also enables the fastest signature generation along with the lowest energy consumption and end-to-end delay among its counterparts. These significant computational advantages come with a larger storage requirement, which is a highly favorable trade-off for some critical delay-aware applications. These desirable features are achieved by harnessing message encoding with cover-free families and special elliptic curve based one-way function. We prove the security of ARIS under the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem in the random oracle model. We provide an open-sourced implementation of ARIS on commodity hardware and 8-bit AVR microcontroller for public testing and verification.",

This article starts from introducing the basic concept of blockchain and illustrating why consensus mechanism plays an indispensable role in a blockchain enabled IoT system. Then, we discuss the main ideas of two famous consensus mechanisms including Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), and list their limitations in IoT. Next, two mainstream Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) based consensus mechanisms, i.e., the Tangle and Hashgraph, are reviewed to show why DAG consensus is more suitable for IoT system than PoW and PoS. Potential issues and challenges of DAG based consensus mechanism to be addressed in the future are discussed in the last.",

To address these challenges there are various IoT Frameworks, which offer solutions for managing and controlling IoT-components and their interactions.

Research currently focuses more on designing and developing these frameworks and does not satisfactorily provide methodologies for evaluating the resulting costs of providing security.

To that end, we propose AI-enabled blockchain (AIBC) with a 2-step consensus protocol that uses an outlier detection algorithm for consensus in an IoT network implemented on hyperledger fabric platform. The outlier-aware consensus protocol exploits a supervised machine learning algorithm which detects anomaly activities via a learned detector in the first step. Then, the data goes through the inherent Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocol in the hyperledger fabric for ledger update. We measure and report the performance of our framework with respect to the various delay components. Results reveal that our implemented AIBC network (2-step consensus protocol) improves hyperledger fabric performance in terms of fault tolerance by marginally compromising the delay performance.",

To this end, we formulate the MARL problem based on the linear programming form of the policy optimization problem and propose a distributed primal-dual algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. We also propose a voting mechanism through which the distributed learning achieves the same sublinear convergence rate as centralized learning. In other words, the distributed decision making does not slow down the process of achieving global consensus on optimality.

As a solution to this problem, we come up with a federated identity authentication protocol exclusively tailored to IoT. Federated Lightweight Authentication of Things (FLAT), our solution, replaces weighty protocols and asymmetric cryptographic primitives used in traditional FIdM by lighter ones. For instance, FLAT synergistically combines symmetric cryptosystems and Implicit Certificates. The results show that FLAT can reduce the data exchange overhead by around 31% when compared to a baseline solution. FLAT's Client is also more efficient than the baseline solution in terms of data transmitted, data received, total data exchange, and computation time. Our results indicate that FLAT runs efficiently even on top of resource-constrained devices like Arduino.",

    "abstract": "A considerable part of recent research in smart cities and IoT has focused on achieving energy savings in buildings and supporting aspects related to sustainability. In this context, the educational community is one of the most important ones to consider, since school buildings constitute a large part of non-residential buildings, while also educating students on sustainability matters is an investment for the future. In this work, we discuss a methodology for achieving energy savings in schools based on the utilization of data produced by an IoT infrastructure installed inside school buildings and related educational scenarios. We present the steps comprising this methodology in detail, along with a set of tangible results achieved within the GAIA project. We also showcase how an IoT infrastructure can support activities in an educational setting and produce concrete outcomes, with typical levels of 20% energy savings.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of the Fog computing paradigm that leverages in-network virtualized resources raises important challenges in terms of resource and IoT application management in a heterogeneous environment offering only limited computing resources. In this work, we propose a novel Pareto-based approach for application placement close to the data sources called Multiobjective IoT application Placement in fOg (MAPO). MAPO models applications based on a finite state machine and uses three conflicting optimization objectives, namely completion time, energy consumption, and economic cost, considering both the computation and communication aspects. In contrast to existing solutions that optimize a single objective value, MAPO enables multi-objective energy and cost-aware application placement. To evaluate the quality of the MAPO placements, we created both simulated and real-world testbeds tailored for a set of medical IoT application case studies. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, MAPO reduces the economic cost by up to 27%, while decreasing the energy requirements by 23-68%, and optimizes the completion time by up to 7.3 times.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to transform many industries. This includes harnessing real-time intelligence to improve risk-based decision making and supporting adaptive processes from core to edge. For example, modern police investigation processes are often extremely complex, data-driven and knowledge-intensive. In such processes, it is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis; as the knowledge workers (e.g., police investigators) will need to collect, understand and relate the big data (scattered across various systems) to process analysis. In this thesis, we analyze the state of the art in knowledge-intensive and data-driven processes. We present a scalable and extensible IoT-enabled process data analytics pipeline to enable analysts ingest data from IoT devices, extract knowledge from this data and link them to process execution data. We focus on a motivating scenario in policing, where a criminal investigator will be augmented by smart devices to collect data and to identify devices around the investigation location, to communicate with them to understand and analyze evidence. We design and implement a system (namely iCOP, IoT-enabled COP) to assist investigators collect large amounts of evidence and dig for the facts in an easy way.",

On the radio access segment, IoT devices send packets to access points (APs) over an erasure collision channel using the slotted ALOHA protocol. Then, the APs forward correctly received messages to a base station (BS) over a shared wireless backhaul segment, modeled as an erasure collision channel. The APs hence play the role of uncoordinated relays that provide space diversity and may reduce performance losses caused by collisions. Both non-orthogonal and inter-service orthogonal resource sharing are considered and compared. Throughput and reliability metrics are analyzed, and numerical results are provided to assess the performance trade-offs between critical and non-critical IoT services.",

The proposed measurement module combines commodity components with a common system interfaces to achieve easy, flexible integration with various hardware platforms and the RIOT IoT operating system. We thoroughly evaluate and compare accuracy and overhead. Our findings indicate that our commodity design competes well with highly optimized solutions, while being significantly more versatile.

Using privacy policy is the most common way for this type of notices. However, privacy policies are not generally effective due to two main reasons: first, privacy policies are long and full of legal jargon which are not understandable by a normal user; second, it is not guaranteed that an IoT device behave as it is explained in its privacy policy. In this technical report, we propose and discuss our methodologies to analyze privacy policies. By the help of this analysis, we reduce the length of a privacy policy and make it organized based on privacy practices to improve understanding level for the user.

Then, we design a nonce ordering algorithm for this scheme to provide fairer computing resource allocation for all mobile IoT devices/users. Specifically, we formulate the user's nonce selection strategy as a non-cooperative game, where the utilities of individual user are maximized in the untrusted MEC-aided mobile blockchain network. We also prove the existence of Nash equilibrium and analyze that the cooperation behavior is unsuitable for the blockchain-enabled IoT devices by using the repeated game. Finally, we design the blockchain's difficulty adjustment mechanism to ensure stable block times during a long period of time.",

Ensuring the correct construction, the well-functioning and the reliability of these applications constitute important issues for some of these applications which can be critical in case of dysfunction. We propose on the basis of the formal model of their common architectural properties, a generic framework for the formal modelling of IoT-based applications, the rigorous analysis of their consistency properties, their rigorous construction and evolution. Specific properties can be gradually added and checked. The proposed framework is then implemented and experimented using Event-B. We exploit the observation that the main requirements of the IoT-based physical architectures and control software are common to all IoT-based applications; this leaded us to the definition of the generic formal model together with invariant architectural and consistency properties. The proposed approach is generic, extensible, and can be profitably adapted to more general hybrid or cyber-physical systems. Our current implementation is independent of the formal model, it can be achieved in various other formal analysis environments.",

To this end, the paper quantifies the peak AoI for large scale cellular network with Bernoulli uplink traffic.

The use of face recognition feature in intrusion detection makes the system more efficient by identifying the known and unknown person in restricted areas. WiFi module processes the sensor based events and sends the sensor status to controller section. Upon receiving the event notification, the controller enables the camera for capturing the event, alerts the user via email, phone call and Short Message Service (SMS) and places the live video of event on webpage. The use of WiFi module makes the node compact, cost effective and easy to use. The biggest advantage of the system is that the user can seek surveillance from anywhere in the world and can respond according to the situations.",

Two different CRA-based random access schemes are discussed (one is conventional and the other is new based on a simplified handshaking process). Based on the throughput analysis, we show that the CRA-based random access scheme with simplified handshaking process can outperform as its length of payload is adaptively decided depending on the number of active users. Simulation results confirm that the derived throughput expressions agree with them and can be used to design a random access system for MTC with each active device or sensor that has one short message.",

    "abstract": "An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aims to alert users of incoming attacks by deploying a detector that monitors network traffic continuously. As an effort to increase detection capabilities, a set of independent IDS detectors typically work collaboratively to build intelligence of holistic network representation, which is referred to as Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS). However, developing an effective CIDS, particularly for the IoT ecosystem raises several challenges. Recent trends and advances in blockchain technology, which provides assurance in distributed trust and secure immutable storage, may contribute towards the design of effective CIDS. In this poster abstract, we present our ongoing work on a decentralized CIDS for IoT, which is based on blockchain technology. We propose an architecture that provides accountable trust establishment, which promotes incentives and penalties, and scalable intrusion information storage by exchanging bloom filters. We are currently implementing a proof-of-concept of our modular architecture in a local test-bed and evaluate its effectiveness in detecting common attacks in IoT networks and the associated overhead.",

This paper considers a fog-based IoT network, in which active IoT devices transmit measurements of the monitored QoIs to the local edge node (EN), while the ENs are connected to a cloud processor via limited-capacity fronthaul links. While the conventional approach uses preambles as metadata for reserving communication resources, here we consider assigning preambles directly to measurement levels across all devices. The resulting Type-Based Multiple Access (TBMA) protocol enables the efficient remote detection of the QoIs, rather than of the individual payloads. The performance of both edge and cloud-based detection or hypothesis testing is evaluated in terms of error exponents. Cloud-based hypothesis testing is shown theoretically and via numerical results to be advantageous when the inter-cell interference power and the fronthaul capacity are sufficiently large.",

Thus, it is more fine-grained than the location-based metering of state-of-the-art infrastructure, which traditionally aggregates on a building or household level, defining the entity to be billed. However, such in-device energy metering is susceptible to manipulation and fraud. As a remedy, we propose a decentralized metering architecture that enables devices with IoT capabilities to measure their own energy consumption. In this architecture, the device-level consumption is additionally reported to a system-level aggregator that verifies distributed information and provides secure data storage using Blockchain, preventing data manipulation by untrusted entities. Using evaluations on an experimental testbed, we show that the proposed architecture supports device mobility and enables location-independent monitoring of energy consumption.",

In order to facilitate the harmonic and fair coexistence in wireless heterogeneous networks, it is important to eliminate NB-IoT interference to LTE systems. In this paper, a novel sparse machine learning based framework and a sparse combinatorial optimization problem is formulated for accurate NBI recovery, which can be efficiently solved using the proposed iterative sparse learning algorithm called sparse cross-entropy minimization (SCEM). To further improve the recovery accuracy and convergence rate, regularization is introduced to the loss function in the enhanced algorithm called regularized SCEM. Moreover, exploiting the spatial correlation of NBI, the framework is extended to multiple-input multiple-output systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods are effective in eliminating NB-IoT interference to LTE systems, and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",

Due to the lack of fees, malicious nodes can exploit this feature to generate an unbounded number of transactions and perform a denial of service attacks. We propose to mitigate these attacks through verifiable delay functions. These functions, which are non-parallelizable, hard to compute, and easy to verify, have been formulated only recently. In our work, we design a denial of service prevention mechanism which addresses network heterogeneity, limited node computational capabilities, and hardware-specific implementation optimizations.

Furthermore, for the proposed WPT-NOMA scheme, the application of hybrid successive interference cancelation (SIC) is also considered, and analytical results are developed to demonstrate that WPT-NOMA can avoid outage probability error floors and realize the full diversity gain. Unlike WPT-NOMA, BAC-NOMA suffers from an outage probability error floor, and the asymptotic behaviour of this error floor is analyzed in the paper by applying the extreme value theory. In addition, the effect of a unique feature of BAC-NOMA, i.e., employing one device's signal as the carrier signal for another device, is studied, and its impact on the diversity gain is revealed. Simulation results are also provided to compare the performance of the proposed strategies and verify the developed analytical results.",

In this paper, we formulate such a task offloading problem with unknown system dynamics as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem with long-term constraints on time-averaged energy consumptions. Through an effective integration of online learning and online control, we propose a \\textit{Learning-Aided Green Offloading} (LAGO) scheme. In LAGO, we employ bandit learning methods to handle the exploitation-exploration tradeoff and utilize virtual queue techniques to deal with the long-term constraints. Our theoretical analysis shows that LAGO can reduce the average task latency with a tunable sublinear regret bound over a finite time horizon and satisfy the long-term time-averaged energy constraints. We conduct extensive simulations to verify such theoretical results.",

Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing solutions are important to contain the spreads of COVID-19-like infectious diseases. However, current contact tracing solutions are fragmented with limited use of sensing technologies and centered on monitoring the interactions between individuals without an analytical framework for evaluating effectiveness. Therefore, we need to first explore generic architecture for contact tracing in the context of today's Internet of Things (IoT) technologies based on a broad range of applicable sensors. A new architecture for IoT based solutions to contact tracing is proposed and its overall effectiveness for disease containment is analyzed based on the traditional epidemiological models with the simulation results. The proposed work aims to provide a framework for assisting future designs and evaluation of IoT-based contact tracing solutions and to enable data-driven collective efforts on combating current and future infectious diseases.",

Existing solutions are generally server-aided, cannot deal with the collusion threat between the servers or between the servers and data owners, and do not match the delicate environments of IoT.

Rigorous security analysis demonstrates the proposed protocols can protect the privacy of each participant in the honest-but-curious model and defend the security under most collusion situations.

While traditional interfaces such as SPI cannot cope with these tight requirements, low-voltage swing transceivers can tackle this challenge thanks to their capability to achieve several Gbps of bandwidth at extremely low power. However, recent research on high-speed serial links addressed this challenge only partially, proposing only partial or stand-alone designs, and not addressing their integration in real systems and the related implications. In this paper, we present for the first time a complete design and system-level architecture of a low-voltage swing transceiver integrated within a low-power (mW range) IoT end-node processors, and we compare it with existing microcontroller interfaces. The transceiver, implemented in a commercial 65-nm CMOS technology achieves 10.2x higher energy efficiency at 15.7x higher performance than traditional microcontroller peripherals (single lane).",

Internet of Things (IoT) technology has lately been adopted in healthcare systems to collect sensor values for heart disease diagnosis and prediction. Many researchers have focused on the diagnosis of heart disease, yet the accuracy of the diagnosis results is low. To address this issue, an IoT framework is proposed to evaluate heart disease more accurately using a Modified Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MDCNN). The smartwatch and heart monitor device that is attached to the patient monitors the blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG). The MDCNN is utilized for classifying the received sensor data into normal and abnormal. The performance of the system is analyzed by comparing the proposed MDCNN with existing deep learning neural networks and logistic regression. The results demonstrate that the proposed MDCNN based heart disease prediction system performs better than other methods. The proposed method shows that for the maximum number of records, the MDCNN achieves an accuracy of 98.2 which is better than existing classifiers.",

Motivated by this, we define an inconsistent subsequences problem in multivariate time series, and propose an integrity data repair approach to solve inconsistent problems. Our proposed repairing method consists of two parts: (1) we design effective anomaly detection method to discover latent inconsistent subsequences in the IoT time series; and (2) we develop repair algorithms to precisely locate the start and finish time of inconsistent intervals, and provide reliable repairing strategies. A thorough experiment on two real-life datasets verifies the superiority of our method compared to other practical approaches. Experimental results also show that our method captures and repairs inconsistency problems effectively in industrial time series in complex IIoT scenarios.",

In this work, we focus on the adaptation of Honeypots for improving the security of IoTs. Low-interaction honeypots are used so far in the context of IoT. Such honeypots are limited and easily detectable, and thus, there is a need to find ways how to develop high-interaction, reliable, IoT honeypots that will attract skilled attackers. In this work, we propose the SIPHON architecture - a Scalable high-Interaction Honeypot platform for IoT devices. Our architecture leverages IoT devices that are physically at one location and are connected to the Internet through so-called wormholes distributed around the world. The resulting architecture allows exposing few physical devices over a large number of geographically distributed IP addresses. We demonstrate the proposed architecture in a large scale experiment with 39 wormhole instances in 16 cities in 9 countries. Based on this setup, six physical IP cameras, one NVR and one IP printer are presented as 85 real IoT devices on the Internet, attracting a daily traffic of 700MB for a period of two months. A preliminary analysis of the collected traffic indicates that devices in some cities attracted significantly more traffic than others (ranging from 600 000 incoming TCP connections for the most popular destination to less than 50000 for the least popular). We recorded over 400 brute-force login attempts to the web-interface of our devices using a total of 1826 distinct credentials, from which 11 attempts were successful. Moreover, we noted login attempts to Telnet and SSH ports some of which used credentials found in the recently disclosed Mirai malware.",

    "abstract": "Secure signal authentication is arguably one of the most challenging problems in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, due to the large-scale nature of the system and its susceptibility to man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks. In this paper, a novel deep learning method is proposed for dynamic authentication of IoT signals to detect cyber attacks. The proposed learning framework, based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure, enables the IoT devices (IoTDs) to extract a set of stochastic features from their generated signal and dynamically watermark these features into the signal. This method enables the cloud, which collects signals from the IoT devices, to effectively authenticate the reliability of the signals. Moreover, in massive IoT scenarios, since the cloud cannot authenticate all the IoTDs simultaneously due to computational limitations, a game-theoretic framework is proposed to improve the cloud's decision making process by predicting vulnerable IoTDs. The mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE) for this game is derived and the uniqueness of the expected utility at the equilibrium is proven. In the massive IoT system, due to a large set of available actions for the cloud, it is shown that analytically deriving the MSNE is challenging and, thus, a learning algorithm proposed that converges to the MSNE. Moreover, in order to cope with the incomplete information case in which the cloud cannot access the state of the unauthenticated IoTDs, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to dynamically predict the state of unauthenticated IoTDs and allow the cloud to decide on which IoTDs to authenticate. Simulation results show that, with an attack detection delay of under 1 second the messages can be transmitted from IoT devices with an almost 100% reliability.",

    "abstract": "A new development of smart-home systems is to use mobile apps to control IoT devices across a Home Area Network (HAN). Those systems tend to rely on the Wi-Fi router to authenticate other devices; as verified in our study, IoT vendors tend to trust all devices connected to the HAN. This treatment exposes them to the attack from malicious apps, particularly those running on authorized phones, which the router does not have information to control, as confirmed in our measurement study. Mitigating this threat cannot solely rely on IoT manufacturers, which may need to change the hardware on the devices to support encryption, increasing the cost of the device, or software developers who we need to trust to implement security correctly. In this work, we present a new technique to control the communication between the IoT devices and their apps in a unified, backward-compatible way. Our approach, called Hanguard, does not require any changes to the IoT devices themselves, the IoT apps or the OS of the participating phones. Hanguard achieves a fine-grained, per-app protection through bridging the OS-level situation awareness and the router-level per-flow control: each phone runs a non-system userspace Monitor app to identify the party that attempts to access the protected IoT device and inform the router through a control plane of its access decision; the router enforces the decision on the data plane after verifying whether the phone should be allowed to talk to the device. Hanguard uses a role-based access control (RBAC) schema which leverages type enforcement (TE) and multi-category security (MCS) primitives to define highly flexible access control rules. We implemented our design over both Android and iOS (>95% of mobile OS market share) and a popular router. Our study shows that Hanguard is both efficient and effective in practice.",

    "abstract": "Ambient radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting has emerged as a promising solution for powering small devices and sensors in massive Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem due to its ubiquity and cost efficiency. In this paper, we study joint uplink and downlink coverage of cellular-based ambient RF energy harvesting IoT where the cellular network is assumed to be the only source of RF energy. We consider a time division-based approach for power and information transmission where each time-slot is partitioned into three sub-slots: (i) charging sub-slot during which the cellular base stations (BSs) act as RF chargers for the IoT devices, which then use the energy harvested in this sub-slot for information transmission and/or reception during the remaining two sub-slots, (ii) downlink sub-slot during which the IoT device receives information from the associated BS, and (iii) uplink sub-slot during which the IoT device transmits information to the associated BS. For this setup, we characterize the joint coverage probability, which is the joint probability of the events that the typical device harvests sufficient energy in the given time slot and is under both uplink and downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage with respect to its associated BS. This metric significantly generalizes the prior art on energy harvesting communications, which usually focused on downlink or uplink coverage separately. The key technical challenge is in handling the correlation between the amount of energy harvested in the charging sub-slot and the information signal quality (SINR) in the downlink and uplink sub-slots. Dominant BS-based approach is developed to derive tight approximation for this joint coverage probability. Several system design insights including comparison with regularly powered IoT network and throughput-optimal slot partitioning are also provided.",

    "abstract": "Emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) require latency-aware computation for real-time application processing. In IoT environments, connected things generate a huge amount of data, which are generally referred to as big data. Data generated from IoT devices are generally processed in a cloud infrastructure because of the on-demand services and scalability features of the cloud computing paradigm. However, processing IoT application requests on the cloud exclusively is not an efficient solution for some IoT applications, especially time-sensitive ones. To address this issue, Fog computing, which resides in between cloud and IoT devices, was proposed. In general, in the Fog computing environment, IoT devices are connected to Fog devices. These Fog devices are located in close proximity to users and are responsible for intermediate computation and storage. Fog computing research is still in its infancy, and taxonomy-based investigation into the requirements of Fog infrastructure, platform, and applications mapped to current research is still required. This paper starts with an overview of Fog computing in which the definition of Fog computing, research trends, and the technical differences between Fog and cloud are reviewed. Then, we investigate numerous proposed Fog computing architecture and describe the components of these architectures in detail. From this, the role of each component will be defined, which will help in the deployment of Fog computing. Next, a taxonomy of Fog computing is proposed by considering the requirements of the Fog computing paradigm. We also discuss existing research works and gaps in resource allocation and scheduling, fault tolerance, simulation tools, and Fog-based microservices. Finally, by addressing the limitations of current research works, we present some open issues, which will determine the future research direction.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) constitute one of the most promising third-millennium technologies and have a wide range of applications in our surrounding environment. The reason behind the vast adoption of WSNs in various applications is that they have tremendously appealing features, e.g., low production cost, low installation cost, unattended network operation, autonomous and longtime operation. WSNs have started to merge with the Internet of Things (IoT) through the introduction of Internet access capability in sensor nodes and sensing ability in Internet-connected devices. Thereby, the IoT is providing access to huge amount of data, collected by the WSNs, over the Internet. However, owing to the absence of a physical line-of-defense, i.e. there is no dedicated infrastructure such as gateways to watch and observe the flowing information in the network, security of WSNs along with IoT is of a big concern to the scientific community. Besides, recent integration and collaboration of WSNs with IoT will open new challenges and problems in terms of security. Hence, this would be a nightmare for the individuals using these systems as well as the security administrators who are managing those networks. Therefore, a detailed review of security attacks towards WSNs and IoT, along with the techniques for prevention, detection, and mitigation of those attacks are provided in this paper. In this text, attacks are categorized and treated into mainly two parts, most or all types of attacks towards WSNs and IoT are investigated under that umbrella: \"Passive Attacks\" and \"Active Attacks\". Understanding these attacks and their associated defense mechanisms will help to pave a secure path towards the proliferation and public acceptance of IoT technology.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we apply the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique to improve the massive channel access of a wireless IoT network where solar-powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) relay data from IoT devices to remote servers. Specifically, IoT devices contend for accessing the shared wireless channel using an adaptive $p$-persistent slotted Aloha protocol; and the solar-powered UAVs adopt Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to decode multiple received data from IoT devices to improve access efficiency. To enable an energy-sustainable capacity-optimal network, we study the joint problem of dynamic multi-UAV altitude control and multi-cell wireless channel access management of IoT devices as a stochastic control problem with multiple energy constraints. To learn an optimal control policy, we first formulate this problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), and propose an online model-free Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) algorithm based on Lagrangian primal-dual policy optimization to solve the CMDP. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed algorithm learns a cooperative policy among UAVs in which the altitude of UAVs and channel access probability of IoT devices are dynamically and jointly controlled to attain the maximal long-term network capacity while maintaining energy sustainability of UAVs. The proposed algorithm outperforms Deep RL based solutions with reward shaping to account for energy costs, and achieves a temporal average system capacity which is $82.4\\%$ higher than that of a feasible DRL based solution, and only $6.47\\%$ lower compared to that of the energy-constraint-free system.",

    "abstract": "We live in a time when billions of IoT devices are being deployed and increasingly relied upon. This makes ensuring their availability and recoverability in case of a compromise a paramount goal. The large and rapidly growing number of deployed IoT devices make manual recovery impractical, especially if the devices are dispersed over a large area. Thus, there is a need for a reliable and scalable remote recovery mechanism that works even after attackers have taken full control over devices, possibly misusing them or trying to render them useless. To tackle this problem, we present Lazarus, a system that enables the remote recovery of compromised IoT devices. With Lazarus, an IoT administrator can remotely control the code running on IoT devices unconditionally and within a guaranteed time bound. This makes recovery possible even in case of severe corruption of the devices' software stack. We impose only minimal hardware requirements, making Lazarus applicable even for low-end constrained off-the-shelf IoT devices. We isolate Lazarus's minimal recovery trusted computing base from untrusted software both in time and by using a trusted execution environment. The temporal isolation prevents secrets from being leaked through side-channels to untrusted software. Inside the trusted execution environment, we place minimal functionality that constrains untrusted software at runtime. We implement Lazarus on an ARM Cortex-M33-based microcontroller in a full setup with an IoT hub, device provisioning and secure update functionality. Our prototype can recover compromised embedded OSs and bare-metal applications and prevents attackers from bricking devices, for example, through flash wear out. We show this at the example of FreeRTOS, which requires no modifications but only a single additional task. Our evaluation shows negligible runtime performance impact and moderate memory requirements.",

This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies such as RFID tags and readers, near field communication (NFC) devices and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public clouds is presented.

Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.",

In this paper, we argue that only connected is not enough, beyond that, general objects should have the capability to learn, think, and understand both the physical world by themselves. On the other hand, the future IoT will be highly populated by large numbers of heterogeneous networked embedded devices, which are generating massive or big data in an explosive fashion. Although there is a consensus among almost everyone on the great importance of big data analytics in IoT, to date, limited results, especially the mathematical foundations, are obtained. These practical needs impels us to propose a systematic tutorial on the development of effective algorithms for big data analytics in future IoT, which are grouped into four classes: 1) heterogeneous data processing, 2) nonlinear data processing, 3) high-dimensional data processing, and 4) distributed and parallel data processing. We envision that the presented research is offered as a mere baby step in a potentially fruitful research direction. We hope that this article, with interdisciplinary perspectives, will stimulate more interests in research and development of practical and effective algorithms for specific IoT applications, to enable smart resource allocation, automatic network operation, and intelligent service provisioning.",

    "abstract": "Future Internet-of-Things (IoT) is expected to wirelessly connect billions of low-complexity devices. For wireless information transfer (WIT) in IoT, high density of IoT devices and their ad hoc communication result in strong interference which acts as a bottleneck on WIT. Furthermore, battery replacement for the massive number of IoT devices is difficult if not infeasible, making wireless energy transfer (WET) desirable. This motivates: (i) the design of full-duplex WIT to reduce latency and enable efficient spectrum utilization, and (ii) the implementation of passive IoT devices using backscatter antennas that enable WET from one device (reader) to another (tag). However, the resultant increase in the density of simultaneous links exacerbates the interference issue. This issue is addressed in this paper by proposing the design of full-duplex backscatter communication (BackCom) networks, where a novel multiple-access scheme based on time-hopping spread-spectrum (TH-SS) is designed to enable both one-way WET and two-way WIT in coexisting backscatter reader-tag links. Comprehensive performance analysis of BackCom networks is presented in this paper, including forward/backward bit-error rates and WET efficiency and outage probabilities, which accounts for energy harvesting at tags, non-coherent and coherent detection at tags and readers, respectively, and the effects of asynchronous transmissions.",

If successfully extracted, the knowledge buried in the data can significantly improve the quality of life and foster economic growth. However, a critical bottleneck for realising the efficient IoT is the pressure it puts on the existing communication infrastructures, requiring transfer of enormous data volumes. Aiming at addressing this problem, we propose a novel architecture dubbed Condense, which integrates the IoT-communication infrastructure into data analysis. This is achieved via the generic concept of network function computation: Instead of merely transferring data from the IoT sources to the cloud, the communication infrastructure should actively participate in the data analysis by carefully designed en-route processing. We define the Condense architecture, its basic layers, and the interactions among its constituent modules. Further, from the implementation side, we describe how Condense can be integrated into the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Machine Type Communications (MTC) architecture, as well as the prospects of making it a practically viable technology in a short time frame, relying on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN). Finally, from the theoretical side, we survey the relevant literature on computing \"atomic\" functions in both analog and digital domains, as well as on function decomposition over networks, highlighting challenges, insights, and future directions for exploiting these techniques within practical 3GPP MTC architecture.",

What is needed in these settings is the timely analysis of these large datasets to produce accurate insights on the correctness of user reports. Existing data mining and other artificial intelligence methods are the most popular to gain hidden insights from IoT data, albeit with many challenges. In this paper, we first model the cyber trustworthiness of MCS reports in the presence of intelligent and colluding adversaries. We then rigorously assess, using real IoT datasets, the effectiveness and accuracy of well-known data mining algorithms when employed towards IoT security and privacy. By taking into account the spatio-temporal changes of the underlying phenomena, we demonstrate how concept drifts can masquerade the existence of attackers and their impact on the accuracy of both the clustering and classification processes.

As such, the Internet of Things (IoT), which can monitor and collect a large amount of data on different contexts of a building and feed the data to the processor of the BMS, provides a new opportunity to integrate intelligence into the BMS to monitor and manage the energy consumption of the building in a cost-effective manner. Although an extensive literature is available on IoT based BMS and applications of signal processing techniques for some aspects of building energy management separately, detailed study on their integration to address the overall BMS is quite limited. As such, the proposed paper will address this gap by providing an overview of an IoT based BMS leveraging signal processing and machine learning techniques. It is demonstrated how to extract high-level building occupancy information through simple and low-cost IoT sensors and studied the impact of human activities on energy usage of a building, which can be exploited to design energy conservation measures to reduce the building's energy consumption.",

Among LPWANs, Long Range (LoRa) WAN has been the most promising; an upcoming IoT protocol, already adopted by big mobile operators like KPN and TTN. With LoRaWANs, IoT-devices transmit data to their corresponding gateways over many kilometers in a single hop and with 1% duty-cycle. However, in a LoRa network, any device claims the channel for data-transmission without performing channel-sensing or synchronization with other devices. This increases humongously the number of collisions of information-packets when the number of IoT-devices that are connected per gateway increases. To improve the utilization of the channel, we propose the application of persistent-Carrier Sense Multiple Access (p-CSMA) protocols on the MAC layer of LoRaWANs. In this manuscript, we report on the initial design of a p-CSMA component for the simulation of LoRa networks in ns3. In particular, the classes adding p-CSMA functionality to the IoT-devices are presented. Additionally, the dependencies and relations between these classes and an existing LoRaWAN module on which they apply are detailed. Further, we evaluate this new p-CSMA LoRaWAN module in terms of Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) by simulating LoRa networks. The current report is the first step in the creation of a holistic p-CSMA module, directed to support network-researchers and connoisseurs in simulating all aspects of LoRa networks in ns3.",

Simulation environments that allow analytical modeling are a poor substitute for evaluating software platforms or application workloads in realistic computing environments. Here, we propose VIoLET, a virtual environment for defining and launching large-scale IoT deployments within cloud VMs. It offers a declarative model to specify container-based compute resources that match the performance of the native edge, fog and cloud devices using Docker. These can be inter-connected by complex topologies on which private/public networks, and bandwidth and latency rules are enforced. Users can configure synthetic sensors for data generation on these devices as well. We validate VIoLET for deployments with > 400 devices and > 1500 device-cores, and show that the virtual IoT environment closely matches the expected compute and network performance at modest costs. This fills an important gap between IoT simulators and real deployments.",

    "abstract": "The idea of an open data market envisions the creation of a data trading model to facilitate exchange of data between different parties in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. The data collected by IoT products and solutions are expected to be traded in these markets. Data owners will collect data using IoT products and solutions. Data consumers who are interested will negotiate with the data owners to get access to such data. Data captured by IoT products will allow data consumers to further understand the preferences and behaviours of data owners and to generate additional business value using different techniques ranging from waste reduction to personalized service offerings. In open data markets, data consumers will be able to give back part of the additional value generated to the data owners. However, privacy becomes a significant issue when data that can be used to derive extremely personal information is being traded. This paper discusses why privacy matters in the IoT domain in general and especially in open data markets and surveys existing privacy-preserving strategies and design techniques that can be used to facilitate end to end privacy for open data markets. We also highlight some of the major research challenges that need to be address in order to make the vision of open data markets a reality through ensuring the privacy of stakeholders.",

The Random Access CHannel (RACH) procedure is the first step of connection establishment between IoT devices and Base Stations (BSs) in the cellular-based mIoT network, where modelling the interactions between static properties of physical layer network and dynamic properties of queue evolving in each IoT device are challenging. To tackle this, we provide a novel traffic-aware spatio-temporal model to analyze RACH in cellular-based mIoT networks, where the physical layer network is modelled and analyzed based on stochastic geometry in the spatial domain, and the queue evolution is analyzed based on probability theory in the time domain. For performance evaluation, we derive the exact expressions for the preamble transmission success probabilities of a randomly chosen IoT device with different RACH schemes in each time slot, which offer insights into effectiveness of each RACH scheme. Our derived analytical results are verified by the realistic simulations capturing the evolution of packets in each IoT device. This mathematical model and analytical framework can be applied to evaluate the performance of other types of RACH schemes in the cellular-based networks by simply integrating its preamble transmission principle.",

    "abstract": "Mission critical data dissemination in massive Internet of things (IoT) networks imposes constraints on the message transfer delay between devices. Due to low power and communication range of IoT devices, data is foreseen to be relayed over multiple device-to-device (D2D) links before reaching the destination. The coexistence of a massive number of IoT devices poses a challenge in maximizing the successful transmission capacity of the overall network alongside reducing the multi-hop transmission delay in order to support mission critical applications. There is a delicate interplay between the carrier sensing threshold of the contention based medium access protocol and the choice of packet forwarding strategy selected at each hop by the devices. The fundamental problem in optimizing the performance of such networks is to balance the tradeoff between conflicting performance objectives such as the spatial frequency reuse, transmission quality, and packet progress towards the destination. In this paper, we use a stochastic geometry approach to quantify the performance of multi-hop massive IoT networks in terms of the spatial frequency reuse and the transmission quality under different packet forwarding schemes. We also develop a comprehensive performance metric that can be used to optimize the system to achieve the best performance. The results can be used to select the best forwarding scheme and tune the carrier sensing threshold to optimize the performance of the network according to the delay constraints and transmission quality requirements.",

The heterogeneity of the networks, devices, and services introduces serious vulnerabilities to security attacks, especially distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which exploit massive IoT devices to exhaust both network and victim resources. As such, this study proposes MECshield, a localized DDoS prevention framework leveraging MEC power to deploy multiple smart filters at the edge of relevant attack-source/destination networks. The cooperation among the smart filters is supervised by a central controller. The central controller localizes each smart filter by feeding appropriate training parameters into its self-organizing map (SOM) component, based on the attacking behavior. The performance of the MECshield framework is verified using three typical IoT traffic scenarios. The numerical results reveal that MECshield outperforms existing solutions.",

BC has the potential to overcome security and privacy challenges of Internet of Things (IoT). However, BC is computationally expensive, has limited scalability and incurs significant bandwidth overheads and delays which are not suited to the IoT context. We propose a tiered Lightweight Scalable BC (LSB) that is optimized for IoT requirements. We explore LSB in a smart home setting as a representative example for broader IoT applications. Low resource devices in a smart home benefit from a centralized manager that establishes shared keys for communication and processes all incoming and outgoing requests. LSB achieves decentralization by forming an overlay network where high resource devices jointly manage a public BC that ensures end-to-end privacy and security. The overlay is organized as distinct clusters to reduce overheads and the cluster heads are responsible for managing the public BC. LSB incorporates several optimizations which include algorithms for lightweight consensus, distributed trust and throughput management. Qualitative arguments demonstrate that LSB is resilient to several security attacks. Extensive simulations show that LSB decreases packet overhead and delay and increases BC scalability compared to relevant baselines.",

    "abstract": "Radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) is a promising technology to charge unattended Internet of Things (IoT) low-power devices remotely. To enable this, in future IoT system, besides the traditional data access points (DAPs) for collecting data, energy access points (EAPs) should be deployed to charge IoT devices to maintain their sustainable operations. Practically, the DAPs and EAPs may be operated by different operators, and the DAPs thus need to provide effective incentives to motivate the surrounding EAPs to charge their associated IoT devices. Different from existing incentive schemes, we consider a practical scenario with asymmetric information, where the DAP is not aware of the channel conditions and energy costs of the EAPs. We first extend the existing Stackelberg game-based approach with complete information to the asymmetric information scenario, where the expected utility of the DAP is defined and maximized. To deal with asymmetric information more efficiently, we then develop a contract theory-based framework, where the optimal contract is derived to maximize the DAP's expected utility as well as the social welfare. Simulations show that information asymmetry leads to severe performance degradation for the Stackelberg game-based framework, while the proposed contract theory-based approach using asymmetric information outperforms the Stackelberg game-based method with complete information. This reveals that the performance of the considered system depends largely on the market structure (i.e., whether the EAPs are allowed to optimize their received power at the IoT devices with full freedom or not) than on the information availability (i.e., the complete or asymmetric information).",

Pioneering implementations have proven it is feasible to inter-network very constrained devices, but had to rely on peculiar cross-layered designs and offer a minimalistic set of features. In the long run, however, professional use and massive deployment of IoT devices require full-featured, cleanly composed, and flexible network stacks. This paper introduces the networking architecture that turns RIOT into a powerful IoT system, to enable low-power wireless scenarios. RIOT networking offers (i) a modular architecture with generic interfaces for plugging in drivers, protocols, or entire stacks, (ii) support for multiple heterogeneous interfaces and stacks that can concurrently operate, and (iii) GNRC, its cleanly layered, recursively composed default network stack. We contribute an in-depth analysis of the communication performance and resource efficiency of RIOT, both on a micro-benchmarking level as well as by comparing IoT communication across different platforms. Our findings show that, though it is based on significantly different design trade-offs, the networking subsystem of RIOT achieves a performance equivalent to that of Contiki and TinyOS, the two operating systems which pioneered IoT software platforms.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of Internet of things (IoT) devices and abundance of sensor data has created an increase in real-time data processing such as recognition of speech, image, and video. While currently such processes are offloaded to the computationally powerful cloud system, a localized and distributed approach is desirable because (i) it preserves the privacy of users and (ii) it omits the dependency on cloud services. However, IoT networks are usually composed of resource-constrained devices, and a single device is not powerful enough to process real-time data. To overcome this challenge, we examine data and model parallelism for such devices in the context of deep neural networks. We propose Musical Chair to enable efficient, localized, and dynamic real-time recognition by harvesting the aggregated computational power from the resource-constrained devices in the same IoT network as input sensors. Musical chair adapts to the availability of computing devices at runtime and adjusts to the inherit dynamics of IoT networks. To demonstrate Musical Chair, on a network of Raspberry PIs (up to 12) each connected to a camera, we implement a state-of-the-art action recognition model for videos and two recognition models for images. Compared to the Tegra TX2, an embedded low-power platform with a six-core CPU and a GPU, our distributed action recognition system achieves not only similar energy consumption but also twice the performance of the TX2. Furthermore, in image recognition, Musical Chair achieves similar performance and saves dynamic energy.",

We note several recurring themes. First, users' desires for convenience and connectedness dictate their privacy-related behaviors for dealing with external entities, such as device manufacturers, Internet Service Providers, governments, and advertisers. Second, user opinions about external entities collecting smart home data depend on perceived benefit from these entities. Third, users trust IoT device manufacturers to protect their privacy but do not verify that these protections are in place. Fourth, users are unaware of privacy risks from inference algorithms operating on data from non-audio/visual devices.

A generic scenario for IoT connectivity involves a massive number of machine-type connections. But in a typical application, only a small (unknown) subset of devices are active at any given instant, thus one of the key challenges for providing massive IoT connectivity is to detect the active devices first and then to decode their data with low latency. This article outlines several key signal processing techniques that are applicable to the problem of massive IoT access, focusing primarily on advanced compressed sensing technique and its application for efficient detection of the active devices. We show that massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is especially well-suited for massive IoT connectivity in the sense that the device detection error can be driven to zero asymptotically in the limit as the number of antennas at the base station goes to infinity by using the multiple-measurement vector (MMV) compressed sensing techniques. The paper also provides a perspective on several related important techniques for massive access, such as embedding of short messages onto the device activity detection process and the coded random access.",

Traditionally, the authentication problem is solved by means of a cryptographic protocol. However, the computational complexity of cryptographic protocols and/or scalability problems related to key management, render almost all cryptography based authentication protocols impractical for IoT. The problem of device identification is, on the other hand, sadly neglected. We believe that device fingerprinting can be used to solve both these problems effectively. In this work, we present a methodology to perform device behavioral fingerprinting that can be employed to undertake device type identification. A device behavior is approximated using features extracted from the network traffic of the device. These features are used to train a machine learning model that can be used to detect similar device types. We validate our approach using five-fold cross validation; we report a identification rate of 86-99% and a mean accuracy of 99%, across all our experiments. Our approach is successful even when a device uses encrypted communication. Furthermore, we show preliminary results for fingerprinting device categories, i.e., identifying different device types having similar functionality.",

We derive the interplay amongst density of the access points, communication bandwidth, volume of traffic from heterogeneous sources, and quality of service (QoS) in communications. The presented analytical framework comprises modeling of interference from heterogeneous sources with correlated deployment locations and time-frequency asynchronous radio-resource usage patterns. The derived expressions represent the operation regions and rates in which, energy and cost resources of devices and the access network, respectively, could be traded to achieve a given level of QoS in communications. For example, our expressions indicate the expected increase in QoS by increasing number of transmitted replicas, transmit power, density of the access points, and communication bandwidth. Our results further shed light on scalability of such networks and figure out the bounds up to which, scaling resources can compensate the increase in traffic volume and QoS demand. Finally, we present an energy-optimized operation control policy for IoT devices. The simulation results confirm tightness of the derived analytical expressions, and indicate usefulness of them in planning and operation control of IoT networks.",

However, keeping a local copy of the blockchain ledger is infeasible for low-power and memory-constrained devices. For this reason, they are equipped with lightweight software implementations that only download the useful data structures, e.g. state of accounts, from the blockchain network, when they are updated. In this paper, we consider and analyze a novel scheme, implemented by the nodes of the blockchain network, which aggregates the blockchain data in periodic updates and further reduces the communication cost of the connected IoT devices. We show that the aggregation period should be selected based on the channel quality, the offered rate, and the statistics of updates of the useful data structures. The results, obtained for the Ethereum protocol, illustrate the benefits of the aggregation scheme in terms of a reduced duty cycle of the device, particularly for low signal-to-noise ratios, and the overall reduction of the amount of information transmitted in downlink (e.g., from the wireless base station to the IoT device). A potential application of the proposed scheme is to let the IoT device request more information than actually needed, hence increasing its privacy, while keeping the communication cost constant. In conclusion, our work is the first to provide rigorous guidelines for the design of lightweight blockchain protocols with wireless connectivity.",

In this work we study and improve the amount of time a Linux-based IoT device is powered on to accomplish its tasks. We analyze the processes of system boot up and shutdown on two platforms, the Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless, and enhance duty-cycling performance by identifying and disabling time-consuming or unnecessary units initialized in the userspace. We also study whether SD card speed and SD card capacity utilization affect boot up duration and energy consumption. In addition, we propose 'Pallex', a parallel execution framework built on top of the 'systemd init' system to run a user application concurrently with userspace initialization. We validate the performance impact of Pallex when applied to various IoT application scenarios: (i) capturing an image, (ii) capturing and encrypting an image, (iii) capturing and classifying an image using the the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and (iv) capturing images and sending them to a cloud server. Our results show that system lifetime is increased by 18.3%, 16.8%, 13.9% and 30.2%, for these application scenarios, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Smart lighting is an underlying concept that links three main aspects: solid-state lighting (SSL) technologies, advanced control and universal communication interfaces following global standards. However, this conceptualization is constantly evolving to comply with the guidelines of the next generation of devices that work in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Modern smart lighting systems are based on light emitting diode (LED) technology and involve advanced drivers that have features such as dynamic spectral light reproduction and advanced sensing capabilities. The ultimate feature is of additional advanced services serving as the hub for optical communications that allows coexistence with traditional Wi-Fi gateways in indoor environments. In this context, lighting systems are evolving to support different wireless communications interfaces compatible with the IoT ecosystem. Market tendencies of SSL systems predict the accelerated expansion of connected IoT lighting control systems in different markets from smart homes and industrial environments. These systems offer advanced features never seen before such as advanced spectral control of the light source and also, the inclusion of several communication interfaces. These are mainly wired, radiofrequencies (RF) and optical wireless communications (OWC) interfaces for advanced services such as sensing and visible light communications (VLC). In this paper we present how to design and realize IoT-based smart lighting systems for different applications using different IoT-centric lighting architectures. Finally, different standards and aspects related to interoperability and web services are explained taking into account commercial smart lighting platforms.",

    "abstract": "The success of blockchain as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies has opened up possibilities for its use in other application domains as well. The main advantages of blockchain for its potential use in other domains are its inherent security mechanisms and immunity to different attacks. A blockchain relies on a consensus method for agreeing on any new data. Most of the consensus methods which are currently used for the blockchain of different cryptocurrencies require high computational power and thus are not apt for resource-constrained systems. In this article, we discuss and survey the various blockchain based consensus methods that are applicable to resource constrained IoT devices and networks. A typical IoT network consists of several devices which have limited computational and communications capabilities. Most often, these devices cannot perform intensive computations and are starved for bandwidth. Therefore, we discuss the possible measures that can be taken to reduce the computational power and convergence time for the underlying consensus methods. We also talk about some of the alternatives to the public blockchain like private blockchain and tangle, along with their potential adoption for IoT networks. Furthermore, we review the existing consensus methods that have been implemented and explore the possibility of utilizing them to realize a blockchain based IoT network. Some of the open research challenges are also put forward.",

Consequently, the amount of data generated by devices at the edge of the network will also grow. While cloud computing has been an established and effective way of acquiring computation and storage as a service to many applications, it may not be suitable to handle the myriad of data from IoT devices and fulfill largely heterogeneous application requirements. Fog computing has been developed to lie between IoT and the cloud, providing a hierarchy of computing power that can collect, aggregate, and process data from/to IoT devices. Combining fog and cloud may reduce data transfers and communication bottlenecks to the cloud and also contribute to reduced latencies, as fog computing resources exist closer to the edge. This paper examines this IoT-Fog-Cloud ecosystem and provides a literature review from different facets of it: how it can be organized, how management is being addressed, and how applications can benefit from it. Lastly, we present challenging issues yet to be addressed in IoT-Fog-Cloud infrastructures.",

Users can now access efficient and convenient smart services in smart-city, green-IoT and heterogeneous networks. AI has been applied in various areas, including the intelligent household, advanced health-care, automatic driving and emotional interactions. This paper focuses on current wireless-communication technologies, including cellular-communication technologies (4G, 5G), low-power wide-area (LPWA) technologies with an unlicensed spectrum (LoRa, SigFox), and other LPWA technologies supported by 3GPP working with an authorized spectrum (EC-GSM, LTE-M, NB-IoT). We put forward a cognitive low-power wide-area-network (Cognitive-LPWAN) architecture to safeguard stable and efficient communications in a heterogeneous IoT. To ensure that the user can employ the AI efficiently and conveniently, we realize a variety of LPWA technologies to safeguard the network layer. In addition, to balance the demand for heterogeneous IoT devices with the communication delay and energy consumption, we put forward the AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method, starting from the perspective of traffic control. The AI algorithm provides the smart control of wireless-communication technology, intelligent applications and services for the choice of different wireless-communication technologies. As an example, we consider the AIWAC emotion interaction system, build the Cognitive-LPWAN and test the proposed AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to help solve a wide range of issues that relate to our wellbeing within application domains that include smart cities, healthcare monitoring, and environmental monitoring. IoT is bringing new wireless sensor use cases by taking advantage of the computing power and flexibility provided by Edge and Cloud Computing. However, the software and hardware resources used within such applications must perform correctly and optimally. Especially in applications where a failure of resources can be critical. Service Level Agreements (SLA) where the performance requirements of such applications are defined, need to be specified in a standard way that reflects the end-to-end nature of IoT application domains, accounting for the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics within every layer including the Edge, Network Gateways, and Cloud. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model that captures the key entities of an SLA and their relationships, as a prior step for end-to-end SLA specification and composition. Service level objective (SLO) terms are also considered to express the QoS constraints. Moreover, we propose a new SLA grammar which considers workflow activities and the multi-layered nature of IoT applications. Accordingly, we develop a tool for SLA specification and composition that can be used as a template to generate SLAs in a machine-readable format. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed specification language through a literature survey that includes an SLA language comparison analysis, and via reflecting the user satisfaction results of a usability study.",

For IoT applications, these protocols must be lightweight, since IoT devices are usually resource constrained. Unfortunately, the existing transport and security protocols -- namely TCP/TLS and UDP/DTLS -- fall short in terms of connection overhead, latency, and connection migration when used in IoT applications. In this paper, after studying the root causes of these shortcomings, we show how utilizing QUIC in IoT scenarios results in a higher performance. Based on these observations, and given the popularity of MQTT as an IoT application layer protocol, we integrate MQTT with QUIC. By presenting the main APIs and functions developed, we explain how connection establishment and message exchange functionalities work. We evaluate the performance of MQTTw/QUIC versus MQTTw/TCP using wired, wireless, and long-distance testbeds. Our results show that MQTTw/QUIC reduces connection overhead in terms of the number of packets exchanged with the broker by up to 56%. In addition, by eliminating half-open connections, MQTTw/QUIC reduces processor and memory usage by up to 83% and 50%, respectively. Furthermore, by removing the head-of-line blocking problem, delivery latency is reduced by up to 55%. We also show that the throughput drops experienced by MQTTw/QUIC when a connection migration happens is considerably lower than that of MQTTw/TCP.",

Detecting flaws that lead to such states, requires a holistic view of installed apps, component devices, their configurations, and more importantly, how they interact. In this paper, we design IoTSan, a novel practical system that uses model checking as a building block to reveal \"interaction-level\" flaws by identifying events that can lead the system to unsafe states. In building IoTSan, we design novel techniques tailored to IoT systems, to alleviate the state explosion associated with model checking. IoTSan also automatically translates IoT apps into a format amenable to model checking. Finally, to understand the root cause of a detected vulnerability, we design an attribution mechanism to identify problematic and potentially malicious apps. We evaluate IoTSan on the Samsung SmartThings platform. From 76 manually configured systems, IoTSan detects 147 vulnerabilities. We also evaluate IoTSan with malicious SmartThings apps from a previous effort. IoTSan detects the potential safety violations and also effectively attributes these apps as malicious.",

From the algorithmic perspective, key innovations target online approaches adaptive to different degrees of nonstationarity in IoT dynamics, and their scalable model-free implementation under limited feedback that motivates blind or bandit approaches.

A massive growth and a pervasive presence of these IoT objects is expected in our everyday life. About 20 billion of IoT devices are forecasted to be installed in the next two years. PLC is a compelling technology that could become essential for certain IoT applications. For example, sensor nodes and actuators used in the Smart Buildings domain can be connected through PLC. In this case, the PLC network will work as a backbone for the in-building communication. PLC systems, in this domain, will help to solve or reduce the overcrowded-spectrum problem, exploiting the existing cable infrastructure. Narrow band (NB) PLC is probably the most suitable type of PLC technology for IoT applications. The main reasons are: simple hardware, good coverage, appropriate bit-rate and low cost. Nevertheless, to guarantee reliable connectivity further analysis and improvements should be done. There are such as signal propagation discontinuities, high channel attenuation and noise. Despite the fact that PLC noise is a well-known problem, it still poses several challenges for this technology. This paper aims at adding some new consideration on this topic. This paper describes new results on MC NB noise. The MC noise is measured between the Live-Protective Earth (L-PE) and between Neutral-Protective Earth (N-PE) pairs (L-PE-N configuration), to exploit the symmetries of the channel. The analysis in this paper considers the whole PLC NB frequency spectrum that ranges from 3 kHz to 500 kHz. It considers the noise observed at the two output ports of a given outlet in an in-building network with three conductors.",

We start by summarizing the concept of AoI and its variants with emphasis on the differences between AoI and other well-known performance metrics in the literature, such as throughput and delay. Building on this, we explore freshness-aware IoT design for a network in which IoT devices sense potentially different physical processes and are supposed to frequently update the status of these processes at a destination node (such as a cellular base station). Inspired by the recent interest, we also assume that these IoT devices are powered by wireless energy transfer by the destination node. For this setting, we investigate the optimal sampling policy that jointly optimizes wireless energy transfer and scheduling of update packet transmissions from IoT devices with the goal of minimizing long-term weighted sum-AoI. Using this, we characterize the achievable AoI region. We also compare this AoI-optimal policy with the one that maximizes average throughput (throughput-optimal policy), and demonstrate the impact of system state on their structures. Several promising directions for future research are also presented.",

A configuration specifies the amount of radio resource allocated to each group of devices for random access and for data transmission. Assuming no knowledge of the traffic statistics, there exists an important challenge in \"how to determine the configuration that maximizes the long-term average number of served IoT devices at each Transmission Time Interval (TTI) in an online fashion\". Given the complexity of searching for optimal configuration, we first develop real-time configuration selection based on the tabular Q-learning (tabular-Q), the Linear Approximation based Q-learning (LA-Q), and the Deep Neural Network based Q-learning (DQN) in the single-parameter single-group scenario. Our results show that the proposed reinforcement learning based approaches considerably outperform the conventional heuristic approaches based on load estimation (LE-URC) in terms of the number of served IoT devices. This result also indicates that LA-Q and DQN can be good alternatives for tabular-Q to achieve almost the same performance with much less training time. We further advance LA-Q and DQN via Actions Aggregation (AA-LA-Q and AA-DQN) and via Cooperative Multi-Agent learning (CMA-DQN) for the multi-parameter multi-group scenario, thereby solve the problem that Q-learning agents do not converge in high-dimensional configurations. In this scenario, the superiority of the proposed Q-learning approaches over the conventional LE-URC approach significantly improves with the increase of configuration dimensions, and the CMA-DQN approach outperforms the other approaches in both throughput and training efficiency.",

On the other hand, designing a new custom-designed CNN for each new IoT application is impractical, due to the inherent difficulty in developing competitive models and time-to-market pressure. To address this problem, we investigate the question of: \"Can one utilize an existing optimized CNN model to automatically build a competitive CNN for an IoT application whose objects of interest are a fraction of categories that the original CNN was designed to classify, such that the resource requirement is proportionally scaled down?\" We use the term resource scalability to refer to this concept, and develop a methodology for automated synthesis of resource scalable CNNs from an existing optimized baseline CNN. The synthesized CNN has sufficient learning capacity for handling the given IoT application requirements, and yields competitive accuracy. The proposed approach is fast, and unlike the presently common practice of CNN design, does not require iterative rounds of training trial and error.",

This paper finds that analyzing companion apps to these devices for clues to security vulnerabilities can be an effective strategy. Compared to device hardware and firmware, these apps are easy to download and analyze. A key finding of this study is that the communication between an IoT device and its app is often not properly encrypted and authenticated and these issues enable the construction of exploits to remotely control the devices. To confirm the vulnerabilities found, we created exploits against five popular IoT devices from Amazon by using a combination of static and dynamic analyses. We also did a larger study, finding that analyzing 96 popular IoT devices only required analyzing 32 companion apps. Among the conservative findings, 50% of the apps corresponding to 38% of the devices did not use proper encryption techniques to secure device to companion app communication.

    "abstract": "Collecting data from massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices is a challenging task, since communication circuits are power-demanding while energy supply at IoT devices is limited. To overcome this challenge, backscatter communication emerges as a promising solution as it eliminates radio frequency components in IoT devices. Unfortunately, the transmission range of backscatter communication is short. To facilitate backscatter communication, this work proposes to integrate unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with backscatter data collection. With such a scheme, the UGV could improve the communication quality by approaching various IoT devices. However, moving also costs energy consumption and a fundamental question is: what is the right balance between spending energy on moving versus on communication? To answer this question, this paper studies energy minimization under a joint graph mobility and backscatter communication model. With the joint model, the mobility management and power allocation problem unfortunately involves nonlinear coupling between discrete variables brought by mobility and continuous variables brought by communication. Despite the optimization challenges, an algorithm that theoretically achieves the minimum energy consumption is derived, and it leads to automatic trade-off between spending energy on moving versus on communication in the UGV backscatter system. Simulation results show that if the noise power is small (e.g., -100 dBm), the UGV should collect the data with small movements. However, if the noise power is increased to a larger value (e.g., -60 dBm), the UGV should spend more motion energy to get closer to IoT users.",

    "abstract": "With an enormous range of applications, Internet of Things (IoT) has magnetized industries and academicians from everywhere. IoT facilitates operations through ubiquitous connectivity by providing Internet access to all the devices with computing capabilities. With the evolution of wireless infrastructure, the focus from simple IoT has been shifted to smart, connected and mobile IoT (M-IoT) devices and platforms, which can enable low-complexity, low-cost and efficient computing through sensors, machines, and even crowdsourcing. All these devices can be grouped under a common term of M-IoT. Even though the positive impact on applications has been tremendous, security, privacy and trust are still the major concerns for such networks and an insufficient enforcement of these requirements introduces non-negligible threats to M-IoT devices and platforms. Thus, it is important to understand the range of solutions which are available for providing a secure, privacy-compliant, and trustworthy mechanism for M-IoT. There is no direct survey available, which focuses on security, privacy, trust, secure protocols, physical layer security and handover protections in M-IoT. This paper covers such requisites and presents comparisons of state-the-art solutions for IoT which are applicable to security, privacy, and trust in smart and connected M-IoT networks. Apart from these, various challenges, applications, advantages, technologies, standards, open issues, and roadmap for security, privacy and trust are also discussed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "To reap the benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is imperative to secure the system against cyber attacks in order to enable mission critical and real-time applications. To this end, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been widely used to detect anomalies caused by a cyber attacker in IoT systems. However, due to the large-scale nature of the IoT, an IDS must operate in a distributed manner with minimum dependence on a central controller. Moreover, in many scenarios such as health and financial applications, the datasets are private and IoTDs may not intend to share such data. To this end, in this paper, a distributed generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to provide a fully distributed IDS for the IoT so as to detect anomalous behavior without reliance on any centralized controller. In this architecture, every IoTD can monitor its own data as well as neighbor IoTDs to detect internal and external attacks. In addition, the proposed distributed IDS does not require sharing the datasets between the IoTDs, thus, it can be implemented in IoTs that preserve the privacy of user data such as health monitoring systems or financial applications. It is shown analytically that the proposed distributed GAN has higher accuracy of detecting intrusion compared to a standalone IDS that has access to only a single IoTD dataset. Simulation results show that, the proposed distributed GAN-based IDS has up to 20% higher accuracy, 25% higher precision, and 60% lower false positive rate compared to a standalone GAN-based IDS.",

    "abstract": "Drone cell (DC) is an emerging technique to offer flexible and cost-effective wireless connections to collect Internet-of-things (IoT) data in uncovered areas of terrestrial networks. The flying trajectory of DC significantly impacts the data collection performance. However, designing the trajectory is a challenging issue due to the complicated 3D mobility of DC, unique DC-to-ground (D2G) channel features, limited DC-to-BS (D2B) backhaul link quality, etc. In this paper, we propose a 3D DC trajectory design for the DC-assisted IoT data collection where multiple DCs periodically fly over IoT devices and relay the IoT data to the base stations (BSs). The trajectory design is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem to minimize the average user-to-DC (U2D) pathloss, considering the state-of-the-art practical D2G channel model. We decouple the MINLP problem into multiple quasi-convex or integer linear programming (ILP) sub-problems, which optimizes the user association, user scheduling, horizontal trajectories and DC flying altitudes of DCs, respectively. Then, a 3D multi-DC trajectory design algorithm is developed to solve the MINLP problem, in which the sub-problems are optimized iteratively through the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Compared with the static DC deployment, the proposed trajectory design can lower the average U2D pathloss by 10-15 dB, and reduce the standard deviation of U2D pathloss by 56%, which indicates the improvements in both link quality and user fairness.",

    "abstract": "With the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of security incidents due to insecure and misconfigured IoT devices is increasing. Especially on the consumer market, manufacturers focus on new features and early releases at the expense of a comprehensive security strategy. Hence, experts have started calling for regulation of the IoT consumer market, while policymakers are seeking for suitable regulatory approaches. We investigate how manufacturers can be incentivized to increase sustainable security efforts for IoT products. We propose mandatory security update labels that inform consumers during buying decisions about the willingness of the manufacturer to provide security updates in the future. Mandatory means that the labels explicitly state when security updates are not guaranteed. We conducted a user study with more than 1,400 participants to assess the importance of security update labels for the consumer choice by means of a conjoint analysis. The results show that the availability of security updates (until which date the updates are guaranteed) accounts for 8% to 35% impact on overall consumers' choice, depending on the perceived security risk of the product category. For products with a high perceived security risk, this availability is twice as important as other high-ranked product attributes. Moreover, provisioning time for security updates (how quickly the product will be patched after a vulnerability is discovered) additionally accounts for 7% to 25% impact on consumers' choices. The proposed labels are intuitively understood by consumers, do not require product assessments by third parties before release, and have a potential to incentivize manufacturers to provide sustainable security support.",

    "abstract": "Machine Intelligence (MI) technologies have revolutionized the design and applications of computational intelligence systems, by introducing remarkable scientific and technological enhancements across domains. MI can improve Internet of Things (IoT) in several ways, such as optimizing the management of large volumes of data or improving automation and transmission in large-scale IoT deployments. When considering MI in the IoT context, MI services deployment must account for the latency demands and network bandwidth requirements. To this extent, moving the intelligence towards the IoT end-device aims to address such requirements and introduces the notion of Distributed MI (D-MI) also in the IoT context. However, current D-MI deployments are limited by the lack of MI interoperability. Currently, the intelligence is tightly bound to the application that exploits it, limiting the provisioning of that specific intelligence service to additional applications. The objective of this article is to propose a novel approach to cope with such constraints. It focuses on decoupling the intelligence from the application by revising the traditional device's stack and introducing an intelligence layer that provides services to the overlying application layer. This paradigm aims to provide final users with more control and accessibility of intelligence services by boosting providers' incentives to develop solutions that could theoretically reach any device. Based on the definition of this emerging paradigm, we explore several aspects related to the intelligence distribution and its impact in the whole MI ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Mobile devices have shown to be very useful during and post disaster. If the communication infrastructure breaks down, however, they become almost useless as most services rely on Internet connectivity. Building post-disaster networks based purely on smartphones remains a challenging task, and, as of today, no practical solutions exist. The rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) offers the possibility to improve this situation. With an increase in smart spaces such as smart homes and smart offices, we move towards digital cities that are deeply penetrated by IoT technology. Many IoT devices are battery powered and can aid in mediating an emergency network. In scenarios where the electrical grid is still operational, yet communication infrastructure failed, non-battery powered IoT devices can similarly help to relief congestion or build a backup network in case of cyber attacks. With the recent release of the Bluetooth Mesh standard, a common interface between mobile devices and the IoT has become available. The key idea behind this standard is to allow existing and new devices to build large-scale multi-hop sensor networks. By enabling hundreds of devices to communicate with each other, Bluetooth Mesh (BT MESH) becomes a practical technical solution for enabling communication post disaster. In this paper, we propose a novel emergency network concept that utilises the parts of digital cities that remains operational in case of disaster, thus mediating large-scale post-disaster device-to-device communication. Since the Bluetooth Mesh standard is backwards compatible to Bluetooth 4.0, most of todays mobile devices can join such a network. No special hardware or software modifications are necessary, especially no jail-breaking of the smartphones.",

Yet, data from smart home deployments are hard to come by, and existing empirical studies of smart home devices typically involve only a small number of devices in lab settings. To contribute to data-driven smart home research, we crowdsource the largest known dataset of labeled network traffic from smart home devices from within real-world home networks. To do so, we developed and released IoT Inspector, an open-source tool that allows users to observe the traffic from smart home devices on their own home networks. Since April 2019, 4,322 users have installed IoT Inspector, allowing us to collect labeled network traffic from 44,956 smart home devices across 13 categories and 53 vendors. We demonstrate how this data enables new research into smart homes through two case studies focused on security and privacy. First, we find that many device vendors use outdated TLS versions and advertise weak ciphers. Second, we discover about 350 distinct third-party advertiser and tracking domains on smart TVs. We also highlight other research areas, such as network management and healthcare, that can take advantage of IoT Inspector's dataset. To facilitate future reproducible research in smart homes, we will release the IoT Inspector data to the public.",

    "abstract": "To promote the benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart communities and smart cities, a real-time data marketplace middleware platform, called the Intelligent IoT Integrator (I3), has been recently proposed. While facilitating the easy exchanges of real-time IoT data streams between device owners and third-party applications through the marketplace, I3 is presently a monolithic, centralized platform for a single community. Although the service oriented architecture (SOA) has been widely adopted in the IoT and cyber-physical systems (CPS), it is difficult for a monolithic architecture to provide scalable, inter-operable and extensible services for large numbers of distributed IoT devices and different application vendors. Traditional security solutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be a performance bottleneck or susceptible to a single point of failure. Inspired by containerized microservices and blockchain technology, this paper proposed a BLockchain-ENabled Secure Microservices for Decentralized Data Marketplaces (BlendSM-DDM). Within a permissioned blockchain network, a microservices based security mechanism is introduced to secure data exchange and payment among participants in the marketplace. BlendSM-DDM is able to offer a decentralized, scalable and auditable data exchanges for the data marketplace.",

However, due to the power-intensive and a low-throughput consensus mechanism in existing blockchain, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are still challenges in integrating blockchain technology into resource-constrained IoT platforms. In this paper, Microchain, based on a hybrid Proof-of-Credit (PoC)-Voting-based Chain Finality (VCF) consensus protocol, is proposed to provide a secure, scalable and lightweight distributed ledger for IoT systems. By using a bias-resistant randomness protocol and a cryptographic sortition algorithm, a random subset of nodes are selected as a final committee to perform the consensus protocol. The hybrid consensus mechanism relies on PoC, a pure Proof of stake (PoS) protocol, to determine whether or not a participant is qualified to propose a block, given a fair initial distribution of the credit assignment. The voting-based chain finality protocol is responsible for finalizing a history of blocks by resolving conflicting checkpoint and selecting a unique chain. A proof-of-conception prototype is implemented and tested on a physical network environment. The experimental results verify that the Micorchain is able to offer a partially decentralized, scalable and lightweight distributed ledger protocol for IoT applications.",

Mobile cloud computing and mobile edge computing (MEC) are emerging technologies that can meet the aforementioned requirements using offloading algorithms. In this paper, we analyze the effect of platform-dependent native applications on computational offloading in edge networks and propose a lightweight process migration-based computational offloading framework. The proposed framework does not require application binaries at edge servers and thus seamlessly migrates native applications. The proposed framework is evaluated using an experimental testbed. Numerical results reveal that the proposed framework saves almost 44% of the execution time and 84% of the energy consumption.

    "abstract": "Major benefits of wireless sensor nodes of IoT like low cost and easy deployment are advocating their usage in variety of applications. Some of them are health monitoring, agriculture, environmental and habitant monitoring, and water monitoring. These nodes are autonomous in nature. It follows that they like to operate in a dynamic and adaptive network environment. So, the communication mechanism between IoT nodes must be robust and adaptive with respect to the environmental change. Unfortunately, the traditional networking architecture supports limited and fixed network computations. These limitations inhibit flexible and robust IoT nodes communication. In addition, the energy consumption in communication nodes is high due to limited processing. To address these issues, this paper gives rebirth to the active system. The proposed active network framework brings a novel integration of the active system with recent technologies (software-defined networking and network function virtualization). As a result of integration, the active system runs as a network function virtualization under the control of software-defined networking. In our view, the amalgam of recent technologies with the active system will promote a robust and flexible IoT nodes communication along with reduced energy consumption. Moreover, various design benefits such as security, flexibility, usability, cost, and performance will be added to the system. Additionally, the proposed framework is open and generalized. It can be extended to other networks such as mobile, satellite, and vehicular networks.",

However, great care must be paid to the CPS' complexity, the impact of emerging IoT (Internet of Things) protocols on the CPS infrastructure as well as the impact of information dissemination by these protocols on the safety of these infrastructures. This paper addresses the issue of CPS safety by proposing and evaluating the performance of a CPS management framework and the analysis of the dynamics of the underlining IoT network in the cyber-space. The main contributions of this paper are in threefold. Firstly, a new CPS framework is proposed; that: 1) builds around a layered architecture to compartmentalise the CPS functionalities into different modules for efficiency and scalability and 2) uses an inner feedback loop for the efficient management of CPS infrastructure. Secondly, building upon this framework, a novel diffusion model that uses the epidemic (interference) sets to produce accurate diffusion patterns across the CPS IoT subsystem is proposed. Finally, the proposed diffusion model is numerically analysed to show how it can be used to achieve efficient CPS surveillance in order to trigger reconfiguration to re-optimise the CPS when it is under stress. in IoT settings. The numerical analysis of the diffusion model shows that interference propagates in pairwise disjoint sets, with IoT nodes migrating from \"susceptible\" to \"attacked\" statuses and finally reaching the \"removed\" state at a predictable time. Deployment considerations on some of the current social and public networks are also onsidered",

Then, we correlate the RACH request of an IoT device with its queue status and analyze the evolution of the queue status. Based on the analysis result, we derive the closed-form expression of the random access (RA) success probability of the device. Besides, considering the agreement on converging different services onto a shared infrastructure, we investigate the RAN slicing for mIoT and bursty ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) service multiplexing. Specifically, we formulate the RAN slicing problem as an optimization one to maximize the total RA success probabilities of all IoT devices and provide URLLC services for URLLC devices in an energy-efficient way. A slice resource optimization (SRO) algorithm exploiting relaxation and approximation with provable tightness and error bound is then proposed to mitigate the optimization problem.",

Many of these applications administer data collection on the edge and offer data storage and analytics capabilities in the cloud. This raises the following problems: (i) the processing stages in IoT applications need to have separate implementations for both the edge and the cloud, (ii) the placement of computation is inflexible with separate software stacks, as the optimal deployment decisions need to be made at runtime, and (iii) unified fault tolerance is essential in case of intermittent long-distance network connectivity problems, malicious harming of edge devices, or harsh environments. This paper proposes a novel fault-tolerant architecture CEFIoT for IoT applications by adopting state-of-the-art cloud technologies and deploying them also for edge computing. We solve the data fault tolerance issue by exploiting the Apache Kafka publish/subscribe platform as the unified high-performance data replication solution offering a common software stack for both the edge and the cloud. We also deploy Kubernetes for fault-tolerant management and the advanced functionality allowing on-the-fly automatic reconfiguration of the processing pipeline to handle both hardware and network connectivity based failures.",

In this article, we introduce a new multi-operator network sharing framework that supports the coexistence of IoT and high-speed cellular services. Our framework is based on the radio access network (RAN) sharing architecture recently introduced by 3GPP as a promising solution for operators to improve their resource utilization and reduce the system roll-out cost. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework using the real base station location data in the city of Dublin collected from two major operators in Ireland. Numerical results show that our proposed framework can almost double the total number of IoT devices that can be supported and coexist with other cellular services compared with the case without network sharing.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things comes along with new challenges for experimenting, testing, and operating decentralized socio-technical systems at large-scale. In such systems, autonomous agents interact locally with their users, and remotely with other agents to make intelligent collective choices. Via these interactions they self-regulate the consumption and production of distributed resources. While such complex systems are often deployed and operated using centralized computing infrastructures, the socio-technical nature of these decentralized systems requires new value-sensitive design paradigms; empowering trust, transparency, and alignment with citizens' social values, such as privacy preservation, autonomy, and fairness among citizens' choices. Currently, instruments and tools to study such systems and guide the prototyping process from simulation to live deployment are missing, or not practical in this distributed socio-technical context. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel testbed architecture for decentralized socio-technical systems running on IoT. This new architecture is designed for a seamless reusability of (i) application-independent decentralized services by an IoT application, and (ii) different IoT applications by the same decentralized service. This dual self-integration promises IoT applications that are simpler to prototype, and can interoperate with decentralized services during runtime to self-integrate more complex functionality. Such integration provides stronger validation of IoT applications, and improves resource utilization. Pressure and crash tests during continuous operations of several weeks, with more than 80K network joining and leaving of agents, 2.4M parameter changes, and 100M communicated messages, confirm the robustness and practicality of the testbed architecture.",

Herein, we analyze Selection Combining (SC) and Switch and Stay Combining (SSC) diversity schemes as plausible solutions for enabling ultra-reliable low-latency downlink communications to low-cost IoT devices. We demonstrate the necessity of considering the time spent in auxiliary procedures, which has not been traditionally taken into account, while we show its impact on the reliability performance. We show there is an optimum number of receive antennas, which suggests that under certain conditions it might be required to turn off some of them, specially under the SC operation. We highlight the superiority of SSC with respect to SC as long the associated Signal-to-Noise Ratio threshold is properly selected. We propose using a fixed threshold relying only on long-term channel fading statistics, which leads to near-optimum results.",

Establishing a network infrastructure that is energy efficient, wireless, and still covers a wide area is a larger challenge in this regime. LoRa is a low complexity long range radio technology, which tries to meet these challenges.With LoRaWAN a network model for widespread deployment has been established, which enjoys open public LoRaWAN dissemination such as with the infrastructure of TheThingsNetwork. In this paper, we report about our experiences with developing and deploying LoRa-based smart city applications as part of the MONICA project in Hamburg. Our contributions are twofold. First, we describe the design and implementation of end-to-end IoT applications based on the friendly IoT operating system RIOT. Second, we report on measurements and evaluations of our large field trials during several public events in the city of Hamburg.

However, these systems are likely low-cost resource-constrained embedded systems, equipped with compact memory space, whereby the ability to store the full information state of continuous signals is limited. Hence, in this paper, we develop solutions of efficient timely processing embedded systems for online classification and tracking of continuous signals with compact memory space. Particularly, we focus on the application of smart plugs that are capable of timely classification of appliance types and tracking of appliance behavior in a standalone manner. We implemented a smart plug prototype using low-cost Arduino platform with small amount of memory space to demonstrate the following timely processing operations: (1) learning and classifying the patterns associated with the continuous power consumption signals, and (2) tracking the occurrences of signal patterns using small local memory space. Furthermore, our system designs are also sufficiently generic for timely monitoring and tracking applications in other resource-constrained IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes and investigates an overlay spectrum sharing system in conjunction with the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to enable communications for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Considered is a cooperative cognitive radio network, where two IoT devices (IoDs) exchange their information and also provide relay assistance to a pair of primary users (PUs). Different from most existing works, in this paper, both IoDs can harvest energy from the radio-frequency (RF) signals received from the PUs. By utilizing the harvested energy, they provide relay cooperation to PUs and realize their own communications. For harvesting energy, a time-switching (TS) based approach is adopted at both IoDs. With the proposed scheme, one round of bidirectional information exchange for both primary and IoT systems is performed in four phases, i.e., one energy harvesting (EH) phase and three information processing (IP) phases. Both IoDs rely on the decode-and-forward operation to facilitate relaying, whereas the PUs employ selection combining (SC) technique. For investigating the performance of the considered network, this paper first provides exact expressions of user outage probability (OP) for the primary and IoT systems under Nakagami-m fading. Then, by utilizing the expressions of user OP, the system throughput and energy efficiency are quantified together with the average end-to-end transmission time. Numerical and simulation results are provided to give useful insights into the system behavior and to highlight the impact of various system/channel parameters.",

    "abstract": "Advances in deep neural networks (DNN) greatly bolster real-time detection of anomalous IoT data. However, IoT devices can hardly afford complex DNN models, and offloading anomaly detection tasks to the cloud incurs long delay. In this paper, we propose and build a demo for an adaptive anomaly detection approach for distributed hierarchical edge computing (HEC) systems to solve this problem, for both univariate and multivariate IoT data. First, we construct multiple anomaly detection DNN models with increasing complexity, and associate each model with a layer in HEC from bottom to top. Then, we design an adaptive scheme to select one of these models on the fly, based on the contextual information extracted from each input data. The model selection is formulated as a contextual bandit problem characterized by a single-step Markov decision process, and is solved using a reinforcement learning policy network. We build an HEC testbed, implement our proposed approach, and evaluate it using real IoT datasets. The demo shows that our proposed approach significantly reduces detection delay (e.g., by 71.4% for univariate dataset) without sacrificing accuracy, as compared to offloading detection tasks to the cloud. We also compare it with other baseline schemes and demonstrate that it achieves the best accuracy-delay tradeoff. Our demo is also available online: https://rebrand.ly/91a71",

The solution that has received a lot of attention in both industry and academia is the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) specification. It gives the possibility to the IoT device manufacturers to describe communications needed by each device to work properly. MUD implementation is challenging not only due to the diversity of IoT devices and manufacturer/operator/regulators but also due to the incremental integration of MUD-based flow control in the already existing Internet infrastructure. To provide a better understanding of these challenges, in this work, we explore and investigate the prototypes of three implementations proposed by different research teams and organisations, useful for the community to understand which are the various features implemented by the existing technologies. By considering that there exist some behaviours which can be only defined by local policy, we propose a MUD capable network integrating our User Policy Server(UPS). The UPS provides network administrators and endusers an opportunity to interact with MUD components through a user-friendly interface. Hence, we present a comprehensive survey of the challenges.",

We show how to use Cell-Free Massive MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output) to provide a scalable and energy efficient IoT system. We employ optimal linear estimation with random pilots to acquire CSI (channel state information) for MIMO precoding and decoding. In the uplink, we employ optimal linear decoder and utilize RM (random matrix) theory to obtain two accurate SINR (signal-to-interference plus noise ratio) approximations involving only large-scale fading coefficients. We derive several max-min type power control algorithms based on both exact SINR expression and RM approximations. Next, we consider the power control problem for downlink (DL) transmission. To avoid solving a time-consuming quasi-concave problem that requires repeat tests for the feasibility of a SOCP (second-order cone programming) problem, we develop a neural network (NN) aided power control algorithm that results in 30 times reduction in computation time. This power control algorithm leads to scalable Cell-Free Massive MIMO networks in which the amount of computations conducted by each AP does not depend on the number of network APs. Both UL and DL power control algorithms allow visibly improve the system spectral efficiency (SE) and, more importantly, lead to multi-fold improvements in Energy Efficiency (EE), which is crucial for IoT networks.",

A physical thing can be created by this inventive perception to signify itself in the digital world. Regarding the physical things that are related to the internet, it is worth noting that considering numerous theories and upcoming predictions, they mostly require protected structures, moreover, they are at risk of several attacks. IoTs are endowed with particular routing disobedience called sinkhole attack owing to their distributed features. In these attacks, a malicious node broadcasts illusive information regarding the routings to impose itself as a route towards specific nodes for the neighboring nodes and thus, attract data traffic. RPL (IP-V6 routing protocol for efficient and low-energy networks) is a standard routing protocol which is mainly employed in sensor networks and IoT. This protocol is called SoS-RPL consisting of two key sections of the sinkhole detection. In the first section rating and ranking the nodes in the RPL is carried out based on distance measurements. The second section is in charge of discovering the misbehavior sources within the IoT network through, the Average Packet Transmission RREQ (APT-RREQ). Here, the technique is assessed through wide simulations performed within the NS-3 environment. Based on the results of the simulation, it is indicated that the IoT network behavior metrics are enhanced based on the detection rate, false-negative rate, false-positive rate, packet delivery rate, maximum throughput, and packet loss rate.",

By modeling the locations of the IoT devices as a bipolar Poisson Point Process (PPP) and that of the BSs as another independent PPP, we characterize the performance of the D2D links and status update links in terms of network throughput and Age-of-Information (AoI), respectively. We consider a maximum power constraint and distance-dependent fractional power control for all status update transmissions. Hence, the locations of the IoT devices allowed to send status updates are constrained to lie within the Johnson-Mehl cells. For this set-up, the average network throughput is obtained by deriving the mean success probability of the D2D links, whereas the spatial moments of the temporal mean AoI are obtained by deriving the moments of the temporal means of both success and scheduling probabilities of the status update links.",

This paper presents Hermes, an application-level protocol for the data-plane that can operate over generalized deduplication, as well as over classic deduplication. Hermes significantly reduces the data transmission traffic while effectively decreasing the energy footprint, a relevant matter to consider in the context of IoT deployments.

    "abstract": "With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), IoT intelligence becomes emerging technology. \"Curse of Dimensionality\" is the barrier of data fusion in edge devices for the success of IoT intelligence. A Linguistic Attribute Hierarchy (LAH), embedded with Linguistic Decision Trees (LDTs), can represent a new attribute deep learning. In contrast to the conventional deep learning, an LAH could overcome the shortcoming of missing interpretation by providing transparent information propagation through the rules, produced by LDTs in the LAH. Similar to the conventional deep learning, the computing complexity of optimising LAHs blocks the applications of LAHs. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach to constructing an LAH, embedded with LDTs for decision making or classification by utilising the distance correlations between attributes and between attributes and the goal variable. The set of attributes is divided to some attribute clusters, and then they are heuristically organised to form a linguistic attribute hierarchy. The proposed approach was validated with some benchmark decision making or classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository. The experimental results show that the proposed self-organisation algorithm can construct an effective and efficient linguistic attribute hierarchy. Such a self-organised linguistic attribute hierarchy embedded with LDTs can not only efficiently tackle \"curse of dimensionality\" in a single LDT for data fusion with massive attributes, but also achieve better or comparable performance on decision making or classification, compared to the single LDT for the problem to be solved. The self-organisation algorithm is much efficient than the Genetic Algorithm in Wrapper for the optimisation of LAHs. This makes it feasible to embed the self-organisation algorithm in edge devices for IoT intelligence.",

That notwithstanding, the phenomenon of virtual sensors that are supported by IoT technologies like Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), RFID, WIFI, Bluetooth, ZigBee, IEEE 802.15.4, etc., emulates physical sensors, and enables more efficient resource management through the dynamic allocation of virtual sensor resources. A distinctive example of this has been the proposition of the Dynamic Intelligent Virtual Sensors (DIVS). This DIVS concept is a novel proposition that allows sensing to be done by the use of logical instances through the use of labeled data. This allows for making accurate predictions during data fusion. However, a potential security attack on DIVS may end up providing false labels during the User Feedback Process (UFP), which may interfere with the accuracy of DIVS. This paper investigates the threat landscape in DIVS when employed in IoT ecosystems, in order to identify the extent to which the severity of these threats may hinder accurate prediction of DIVS in IoT, based on labeled data.",

We examine how end-users interact with IoT products and how those products convey information back to the users, particularly 'what is going on' with regards to their data. We focus on understanding what the breadth of IoT, privacy, and ubiquitous computing literature tells us about how individuals with average technical expertise can be notified about the privacy-related information of the spaces they inhabit in an easily understandable way. In this survey, we present a review of the various methods available to notify the end-users while taking into consideration the factors that should be involved in the notification alerts within the physical domain. We identify five main factors: (1) data type, (2) data usage, (3) data storage, (4) data retention period, and (5) notification method. The survey also includes literature discussing individuals' reactions and their potentials to provide feedback about their privacy choices as a response to the received notification.

This is due to (a) the increased dependency on automated device, and (b) the inadequacy of general purpose Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to be deployed for special purpose networks usage. Numerous lightweight protocols are being proposed for IoT devices communication usage. One of the distinguishable IoT machine-to-machine communication protocols is Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. However, as per the authors best knowledge, there are no available IDS datasets that include MQTT benign or attack instances and thus, no IDS experimental results available. In this paper, the effectiveness of six Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect MQTT-based attacks is evaluated. Three abstraction levels of features are assessed, namely, packet-based, unidirectional flow, and bidirectional flow features. An MQTT simulated dataset is generated and used for the training and evaluation processes. The dataset is released with an open access licence to help the research community further analyse the accompanied challenges. The experimental results demonstrated the adequacy of the proposed ML models to suit MQTT-based networks IDS requirements. Moreover, the results emphasise on the importance of using flow-based features to discriminate MQTT-based attacks from benign traffic, while packet-based features are sufficient for traditional networking attacks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a machine learning process for clustering large-scale social Internet-of-things (SIoT) devices into several groups of related devices sharing strong relations. To this end, we generate undirected weighted graphs based on the historical dataset of IoT devices and their social relations. Using the adjacency matrices of these graphs and the IoT devices' features, we embed the graphs' nodes using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to obtain numerical vector representations of the IoT devices. The vector representation does not only reflect the characteristics of the device but also its relations with its peers. The obtained node embeddings are then fed to a conventional unsupervised learning algorithm to determine the clusters accordingly. We showcase the obtained IoT groups using two well-known clustering algorithms, specifically the K-means and the density-based algorithm for discovering clusters (DBSCAN). Finally, we compare the performances of the proposed GNN-based clustering approach in terms of coverage and modularity to those of the deterministic Louvain community detection algorithm applied solely on the graphs created from the different relations. It is shown that the framework achieves promising preliminary results in clustering large-scale IoT systems.",

    "abstract": "After decades of research, the Internet of Things (IoT) is finally permeating real-life and helps improve the efficiency of infrastructures and processes as well as our health. As a massive number of IoT devices are deployed, they naturally incur great operational costs to ensure intended operations. To effectively handle such intended operations in massive IoT networks, automatic detection of malfunctioning, namely anomaly detection, becomes a critical but challenging task. In this paper, motivated by a real-world experimental IoT deployment, we introduce four types of wireless network anomalies that are identified at the link layer. We study the performance of threshold- and machine learning (ML)-based classifiers to automatically detect these anomalies. We examine the relative performance of three supervised and three unsupervised ML techniques on both non-encoded and encoded (autoencoder) feature representations. Our results demonstrate that; i) selected supervised approaches are able to detect anomalies with F1 scores of above 0.98, while unsupervised ones are also capable of detecting the said anomalies with F1 scores of, on average, 0.90, and ii) OC-SVM outperforms all the other unsupervised ML approaches reaching at F1 scores of 0.99 for SuddenD, 0.95 for SuddenR, 0.93 for InstaD and 0.95 for SlowD.",

    "abstract": "Many Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios require communication to and data acquisition from multiple devices with similar functionalities. For such scenarios, group communication in the form of multicasting and broadcasting has proven to be effective. Group Key Management (GKM) involves the handling, revocation, updation and distribution of cryptographic keys to members of various groups. Classical GKM schemes perform inefficiently in dynamic IoT environments, which are those wherein nodes frequently leave or join a network or migrate from one group to another over time. Recently, the `GroupIt' scheme has been proposed for GKM in dynamic IoT environments. However, this scheme has several limitations such as vulnerability to collusion attacks, the use of computationally expensive asymmetric encryption and threats to the backward secrecy of the system. In this paper, we present a highly efficient and secure GKM protocol for dynamic IoT settings, which maintains forward and backward secrecy at all times. Our proposed protocol uses only symmetric encryption, and is completely resistant to collusion attacks. Also, our protocol is highly flexible and can handle several new scenarios in which device or user dynamics may take place, e.g., allowing a device group to join or leave the network or creation or dissolution of a user group, which are not handled by schemes proposed in prior literature. We evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol via extensive mathematical analysis and numerical computations, and show that it outperforms the GroupIt scheme in terms of the communication and computation costs incurred by users and devices.",

    "abstract": "With the continuous growth of mobile data and the unprecedented demand for computing power, resource-constrained edge devices cannot effectively meet the requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and Deep Neural Network (DNN) computing. As a distributed computing paradigm, edge offloading that migrates complex tasks from IoT devices to edge-cloud servers can break through the resource limitation of IoT devices, reduce the computing burden and improve the efficiency of task processing. However, the problem of optimal offloading decision-making is NP-hard, traditional optimization methods are difficult to achieve results efficiently. Besides, there are still some shortcomings in existing deep learning methods, e.g., the slow learning speed and the failure of the original network parameters when the environment changes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Deep Meta Reinforcement Learning-based offloading (DMRO) algorithm, which combines multiple parallel DNNs with Q-learning to make fine-grained offloading decisions. By aggregating the perceptive ability of deep learning, the decision-making ability of reinforcement learning, and the rapid environment learning ability of meta-learning, it is possible to quickly and flexibly obtain the optimal offloading strategy from the IoT environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves obvious improvement over the Deep Q-Learning algorithm and has strong portability in making real-time offloading decisions even in time-varying IoT environments.",

Recent works have explored machine learning techniques for fingerprinting (or classifying) IoT devices, with promising results. However, existing works have assumed that the features used for building the machine learning models are readily available or can be easily extracted from the network traffic; in other words, they do not consider the costs associated with feature extraction. In this work, we take a more realistic approach, and argue that feature extraction has a cost, and the costs are different for different features. We also take a step forward from the current practice of considering the misclassification loss as a binary value, and make a case for different losses based on the misclassification performance. Thereby, and more importantly, we introduce the notion of risk for IoT device classification. We define and formulate the problem of cost-aware IoT device classification. This being a combinatorial optimization problem, we develop a novel algorithm to solve it in a fast and effective way using the Cross-Entropy (CE) based stochastic optimization technique. Using traffic of real devices, we demonstrate the capability of the CE based algorithm in selecting features with minimal risk of misclassification while keeping the cost for feature extraction within a specified limit.",

A smart home is one of the applications for the Internet of Things. In a smart home, household appliances could be monitored and controlled remotely. This raises a demand for reliable security solutions for IoT systems. Authorization and authentication are challenging IoT security operations that need to be considered. For instance, unauthorized access, such as cyber-attacks, to a smart home system could cause danger by controlling sensors and actuators, opening the doors for a thief. This paper applies an extra layer of security of multi-factor authentication to act as a prevention method for mitigating unauthorized access. One of those factors is face recognition, as it has recently become popular due to its non-invasive biometric techniques, which is easy to use with cameras attached to most trending computers and smartphones. In this paper, the gaps in existing IoT smart home systems have been analyzed, and we have suggested improvements for overcoming them by including necessary system modules and enhancing user registration and log-in authentication. We propose software architecture for implementing such a system. To the best of our knowledge, the existing IoT smart home management research does not support face recognition and liveness detection within the authentication operation of their suggested software architectures.",

To provide reliable connections with extended coverage, a repetition transmission scheme and up to three Coverage Enhancement (CE) groups are introduced into NB-IoT during both Random Access CHannel (RACH) procedure and data transmission procedure, where each CE group is configured with different repetition values and transmission resources. To characterize the RACH performance of the NB-IoT network with three CE groups, this paper develops a novel traffic-aware spatio-temporal model to analyze the RACH success probability, where both the preamble transmission outage and the collision events of each CE group jointly determine the traffic evolution and the RACH success probability. Based on this analytical model, we derive the analytical expression for the RACH success probability of a randomly chosen IoT device in each CE group over multiple time slots with different RACH schemes, including baseline, back-off (BO), access class barring (ACB), and hybrid ACB and BO schemes (ACB&BO). Our results have shown that the RACH success probabilities of the devices in three CE groups outperform that of a single CE group network but not for all the groups, which is affected by the choice of the categorizing parameters.This mathematical model and analytical framework can be applied to evaluate the performance of multiple group users of other networks with spatial separations.",

Along with the growth in the development and implementation of these IoT devices, their simple and rapid deployment, initial configuration and out-of-the-box operational provisioning are becoming prominent challenges to be circumvented. Considering a large number of heterogeneous devices to be deployed within next generation IoT networks, the amount of time needed for manual provisioning of these IoT devices can significantly delay the deployment and manual provisioning may introduce human-induced failures and errors. By incorporating zero-touch provisioning (ZTP), multiple heterogeneous devices can be provisioned with less effort and without human intervention. In this paper, we propose software-enabled access point (Soft-AP)- and Bluetooth-based ZTP solutions relying only on a single mediator device and evaluate their performances using LOG-A-TEC testbed against manual provisioning in terms of the time required for provisioning (time-to-provision, TTP). We demonstrate that on average, Soft-AP- and Bluetooth-based ZTP solutions outperform manual provisioning with about 154% and 313% when compared to the expert provisioning, and with about 434% and 880% when compared to the non-expert provisioning in terms of TTP performances, respectively.",

A systematic literature review was conducted. The types of vulnerabilities and attacks that can affect the wireless technologies that stand the IoT ecosystem and SDR radio platforms were compared. On the IoT system model layer, perception layer was identified as the most vulnerable. Most attacks at this level occur due to limitations in hardware, physical exposure of devices, and heterogeneity of technologies. Future cybersecurity systems based on SDR radios have notable advantages due to their flexibility to adapt to new communication technologies and their potential for the development of advanced tools.

In this context, development of supporting software forms the core part of the IoT infrastructure. A Middleware sits in between the IoT devices and interacts between them to exchange data among the components of the automated architecture. The Middleware services include hand shaking, data transfer and security among its core set of functionalities. It also includes cross-cutting functional services such as authentication, logging and caching. A software that can run these Middleware services requires a careful choice of a good software modelling technique. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a software development methodology that can be used to independently encapsulate the core and cross-cutting functionalities of the Middleware services of the IoT infrastructure. In this paper, an attempt has been made using a simulation environment to independently model the two orthogonal functionalities of the Middleware with the focus to improve its modularity. Further, a quantitative measurement of the core design property of cohesion has been done to infer on the improvement in the reusability of the modules encapsulated in the Middleware of IoT. Based on the measurement, it was found that the modularity and reusability of functionalities in the Middleware software has improved in the AspectJ version compared to its equivalent Java version.",

However, given the presence of massively distributed and private datasets, it is challenging to use classical centralized learning algorithms in the IoT. To overcome this challenge, federated learning can be a promising solution that enables on-device machine learning without the need to migrate the private end-user data to a central cloud. In federated learning, only learning model updates are transferred between end-devices and the aggregation server. Although federated learning can offer better privacy preservation than centralized machine learning, it has still privacy concerns. In this paper, first, we present the recent advances of federated learning towards enabling federated learning-powered IoT applications. A set of metrics such as sparsification, robustness, quantization, scalability, security, and privacy, is delineated in order to rigorously evaluate the recent advances. Second, we devise a taxonomy for federated learning over IoT networks. Third, we propose two IoT use cases of dispersed federated learning that can offer better privacy preservation than federated learning.

Manufacturers announce updates by deploying a smart contract (SC), which in turn will issue cryptocurrency payments to any distributor who provides an unforgeable proof-of-delivery. The latter is provided by IoT devices authorizing the SC to issue payment to a distributor when the required conditions are met. These conditions include the requirement for a distributor to generate a zero-knowledge proof, generated with a novel proving system called zk-SNARKs. Compared with related work, CrowdPatching protocol offers three main advantages. First, the number of distributors can scale indefinitely by enabling the addition of new distributors at any time after the initial distribution by manufacturers (i.e., redistribution among the distributor network). The latter is not possible in existing protocols and is not account for. Secondly, we leverage the recent common integration of gateway or Hub in IoT deployments in our protocol to make CrowdPatching feasible even for the more constraint IoT devices. Thirdly, the trustworthiness of distributors is considered in our protocol, rewarding the honest distributors' engagements.

In this context, various threats have been presented, including black-box attacks, where a malicious participant can accurately recover an arbitrary input fed into his device. In this paper, we introduce a methodology aiming to secure the sensitive data through re-thinking the distribution strategy, without adding any computation overhead. First, we examine the characteristics of the model structure that make it susceptible to privacy threats. We found that the more we divide the model feature maps into a high number of devices, the better we hide proprieties of the original image. We formulate such a methodology, namely DistPrivacy, as an optimization problem, where we establish a trade-off between the latency of co-inference, the privacy level of the data, and the limited-resources of IoT participants. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we introduce an online heuristic that supports heterogeneous IoT devices as well as multiple DNNs and datasets, making the pervasive system a general-purpose platform for privacy-aware and low decision-latency applications.",

However, the development of secure IoT solutions is getting a long way lagged behind, making us exposed to common unauthorized accesses that may bring malicious attacks and unprecedented danger to our daily life. Overprivilege attack, a widely reported phenomenon in IoT that accesses unauthorized or excessive resources, is notoriously hard to prevent, trace and mitigate. To tackle this challenge, we propose Tokoin-Based Access Control (TBAC), an accountable access control model enabled by blockchain and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technologies, to offer fine-graininess, strong auditability, and access procedure control for IoT. TBAC materializes the virtual access power into a definite-amount and secure cryptographic coin termed \"tokoin\" (token+coin), and manages it using atomic and accountable state-transition functions in a blockchain. We also realize access procedure control by mandating every tokoin a fine-grained access policy defining who is allowed to do what at when in where by how. The tokoin is peer-to-peer transferable, and can be modified only by the resource owner when necessary. We fully implement TBAC with well-studied cryptographic primitives and blockchain platforms and present a readily available APP for regular users. We also present a case study to demonstrate how TBAC is employed to enable autonomous in-home cargo delivery while guaranteeing the access policy compliance and home owner's physical security by regulating the physical behaviors of the deliveryman.",

Java is the most common platform for embedded applications such as IoT, Wireless Sensors Networks (WSN), Near Field Communications (NFC) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The object programming languages such as Java, SWIFT, PHP and C++ use garbage collection after any object run which creates security loophole for attacks such as Next Memory Address Occupation (NMAO), memory replay, Learning Tasks Behaviors (LTB). The security risk increases in IoT when attacks exceeds the target device to the surrounding connected devices. Inappropriate or wrong operations causes energy loss and increased costs.

The proposed method prevents directed attack by encrypting the object Garbage Collection at run time.

LocKedge is implemented in two manners: centralized and federated learning manners in order to verify the performance of the architecture from different perspectives. The performance of our proposed mechanism is compared with that of other machine learning and deep learning methods using the most updated BoT IoT data set. The results show that LocKedge outperforms other algorithms such as NN, CNN, RNN, KNN, SVM, KNN, RF and Decision Tree in terms of accuracy and NN in terms of complexity.",

    "abstract": "With diverse IoT workloads, placing compute and analytics close to where data is collected is becoming increasingly important. We seek to understand what is the performance and the cost implication of running analytics on IoT data at the various available platforms. These workloads can be compute-light, such as outlier detection on sensor data, or compute-intensive, such as object detection from video feeds obtained from drones. In our paper, JANUS, we profile the performance/$ and the compute versus communication cost for a compute-light IoT workload and a compute-intensive IoT workload. In addition, we also look at the pros and cons of some of the proprietary deep-learning object detection packages, such as Amazon Rekognition, Google Vision, and Azure Cognitive Services, to contrast with open-source and tunable solutions, such as Faster R-CNN (FRCNN). We find that AWS IoT Greengrass delivers at least 2X lower latency and 1.25X lower cost compared to all other cloud platforms for the compute-light outlier detection workload. For the compute-intensive streaming video analytics task, an opensource solution to object detection running on cloud VMs saves on dollar costs compared to proprietary solutions provided by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, but loses out on latency (up to 6X). If it runs on a low-powered edge device, the latency is up to 49X lower.",

In this paper, NOMA is applied to improve the random access efficiency in high-density spatially-distributed multi-cell wireless IoT networks, where IoT devices contend for accessing the shared wireless channel using an adaptive p-persistent slotted Aloha protocol. To enable a capacity-optimal network, a novel formulation of random channel access with NOMA is proposed, in which the transmission probability of each IoT device is tuned to maximize the geometric mean of users' expected capacity. It is shown that the network optimization objective is high dimensional and mathematically intractable, yet it admits favourable mathematical properties that enable the design of efficient learning-based algorithmic solutions. To this end, two algorithms, i.e., a centralized model-based algorithm and a scalable distributed model-free algorithm, are proposed to optimally tune the transmission probabilities of IoT devices to attain the maximum capacity. The convergence of the proposed algorithms to the optimal solution is further established based on convex optimization and game-theoretic analysis.

However, these lightweight nodes usually do not have enough computing power to complete the consensus or other computing-required tasks. Edge computing network gives a platform to provide computing power to IoT devices. A fundamental problem is how to allocate limited edge servers to IoT devices in a highly untrustworthy environment. In a fair competition environment, the allocation mechanism should be online, truthful, and privacy safe. To address these three challenges, we propose an online multi-item double auction (MIDA) mechanism, where IoT devices are buyers and edge servers are sellers. In order to achieve the truthfulness, the participants' private information is at risk of being exposed by inference attack, which may lead to malicious manipulation of the market by adversaries. Then, we improve our MIDA mechanism based on differential privacy to protect sensitive information from being leaked. It interferes with the auction results slightly but guarantees privacy protection with high confidence. Besides, we upgrade our privacy-preserving MIDA mechanism such that adapting to more complex and realistic scenarios. In the end, the effectiveness and correctness of algorithms are evaluated and verified by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.",

Cloud computing offers services at the infrastructure level that can scale to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are applications such as health monitoring and emergency response that require low latency, and delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to the application can seriously impact their performances. To overcome this limitation, Fog computing paradigm has been proposed, where cloud services are extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and network congestion. To realize the full potential of Fog and IoT paradigms for real-time analytics, several challenges need to be addressed. The first and most critical problem is designing resource management techniques that determine which modules of analytics applications are pushed to each edge device to minimize the latency and maximize the throughput. To this end, we need a evaluation platform that enables the quantification of performance of resource management policies on an IoT or Fog computing infrastructure in a repeatable manner. In this paper we propose a simulator, called iFogSim, to model IoT and Fog environments and measure the impact of resource management techniques in terms of latency, network congestion, energy consumption, and cost. We describe two case studies to demonstrate modeling of an IoT environment and comparison of resource management policies. Moreover, scalability of the simulation toolkit in terms of RAM consumption and execution time is verified under different circumstances.",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Internet of Things has led to many security issues. Recently, there have been malware attacks on IoT devices, the most prominent one being that of Mirai. IoT devices such as IP cameras, DVRs and routers were compromised by the Mirai malware and later large-scale DDoS attacks were propagated using those infected devices (bots) in October 2016. In this research, we develop a network-based algorithm which can be used to detect IoT bots infected by Mirai or similar malware in large-scale networks (e.g. ISP network). The algorithm particularly targets bots scanning the network for vulnerable devices since the typical scanning phase for botnets lasts for months and the bots can be detected much before they are involved in an actual attack. We analyze the unique signatures of the Mirai malware to identify its presence in an IoT device. The prospective deployment of our bot detection solution is discussed next along with the countermeasures which can be taken post detection. Further, to optimize the usage of computational resources, we use a two-dimensional (2D) packet sampling approach, wherein we sample the packets transmitted by IoT devices both across time and across the devices. Leveraging the Mirai signatures identified and the 2D packet sampling approach, a bot detection algorithm is proposed. Subsequently, we use testbed measurements and simulations to study the relationship between bot detection delays and the sampling frequencies for device packets. Finally, we derive insights from the obtained results and use them to design our proposed bot detection algorithm.",

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges in IoT is providing communication support to an increasing number of connected devices. In recent years, narrowband radio technology has emerged to address this situation: Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), which is now part of 5G. Supporting massive connectivity becomes particularly demanding in extreme coverage scenarios such as underground or deep inside buildings sites. We propose a novel strategy for these situations focused on optimizing NB-IoT shared channels through the selection of link parameters: modulation and coding scheme, as well as the number of repetitions. These parameters are established by the base station (BS) for each block transmitted until reaching a target block error rate (BLER_t ). A wrong selection of these magnitudes leads to radio resource waste and a decrease in the number of possible concurrent connections. Specifically, our strategy is based on a look-up table (LUT) scheme which is used for rapidly delivering the optimal link parameters given a target QoS. To validate our proposal, we compare with alternative strategies using an open source NB-IoT uplink simulator. The experiments are based on transmitting blocks of 256 bits using an AWGN channel over the NPUSCH. Results show that, especially under extreme conditions, only a few options for link parameters are available, favoring robustness against measurement uncertainties. Our strategy minimizes resource usage in all scenarios of acknowledged mode and remarkably reduces losses in the unacknowledged mode, presenting also substantial gains in performance. We expect to influence future BS software design and implementation, favoring connection support under extreme environments.",

    "abstract": "Emerging Internet of Thing (IoT) platforms provide a convenient solution for integrating heterogeneous IoT devices and deploying home automation applications. However, serious privacy threats arise as device data now flow out to the IoT platforms, which may be subject to various attacks. We observe two privacy-unfriendly practices in emerging home automation systems: first, the majority of data flowed to the platform are superfluous in the sense that they do not trigger any home automation; second, home owners currently have nearly zero control over their data. We present PFirewall, a customizable data-flow control system to enhance user privacy. PFirewall analyzes the automation apps to extract their semantics, which are automatically transformed into data-minimization policies; these policies only send minimized data flows to the platform for app execution, such that the ability of attackers to infer user privacy is significantly impaired. In addition, PFirewall provides capabilities and interfaces for users to define and enforce customizable policies based on individual privacy preferences. PFirewall adopts an elegant man-in-the-middle design, transparently executing data minimization and user-defined policies to process raw data flows and mediating the processed data between IoT devices and the platform (via the hub), without requiring modifications of the platform or IoT devices. We implement PFirewall to work with two popular platforms: SmartThings and openHAB, and set up two real-world testbeds to evaluate its performance. The evaluation results show that PFirewall is very effective: it reduces IoT data sent to the platform by 97% and enforces user defined policies successfully.",

    "abstract": "A new scalable ISP level system architecture to secure and protect all IoT devices in a large number of homes is presented. The system is based on whitelisting, as in the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) framework, implemented as a VNF. Unlike common MUD suggestions that place the whitelist application at the home/enterprise network, our approach is to place the enforcement upstream at the provider network, combining an NFV (Network Function Virtualization) with router/switching filtering capabilities, e.g., ACLs. The VNF monitors many home networks simultaneously, and therefore, is a highly-scalable managed service solution that provides both the end customers and the ISP with excellent visibility and security of the IoT devices at the customer premises. The system includes a mechanism to distinguish between flows of different devices at the ISP level despite the fact that most home networks (and their IoT devices) are behind a NAT and all the flows from the same home come out with the same source IP address. Moreover, the NFV system needs to receive only the first packet of each connection at the VNF, and rules space is proportional to the number of unique types of IoT devices rather than the number of IoT devices. The monitoring part of the solution is off the critical path and can also uniquely protect from incoming DDoS attacks. To cope with internal traffic, that is not visible outside the customer premise and often consists of P2P communication, we suggest a hybrid approach, where we deploy a lightweight component at the CPE, whose sole purpose is to monitor P2P communication. As current MUD solution does not provide a secure solution to P2P communication, we also extend the MUD protocol to deal also with peer-to-peer communicating devices. A PoC with a large national level ISP proves that our technology works as expected.",

We conduct an expert elicitation study by following a three-round Delphi process with 22 privacy and security experts to identify the factors that experts believed are important for consumers when comparing the privacy and security of IoT devices to inform their purchase decisions. Based on how critical experts believed each factor is in conveying risk to consumers, we distributed these factors across two layers---a primary layer to display on the product package itself or prominently on a website, and a secondary layer available online through a web link or a QR code. We report on the experts' rationale and arguments used to support their choice of factors. Moreover, to study how consumers would perceive the privacy and security information specified by experts, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with 15 participants, who had purchased at least one IoT device (smart home device or wearable). Based on the results of our expert elicitation and consumer studies, we propose a prototype privacy and security label to help consumers make more informed IoT-related purchase decisions.",

Consequently, trustworthy data act as fuel for applications that rely on the data generated by these things, for critical decision-making processes, data debugging, risk assessment, forensic analysis, and performance tuning. Currently, secure and reliable data communication in IoT is based on public-key cryptosystems such as Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC). Nevertheless, reliance on the security of de-facto cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by the impending quantum computers. Therefore, the transition from classical primitives to quantum-safe primitives is indispensable to ensure the overall security of data en route. In this paper, we investigate applications of one of the post-quantum signatures called Hash-Based Signature (HBS) schemes for the security of IoT devices in the quantum era. We give a succinct overview of the evolution of HBS schemes with emphasis on their construction parameters and associated strengths and weaknesses. Then, we outline the striking features of HBS schemes and their significance for the IoT security in the quantum era. We investigate the optimal selection of HBS in the IoT networks with respect to their performance-constrained requirements, resource-constrained nature, and design optimization objectives. In addition to ongoing standardization efforts, we also highlight current and future research and deployment challenges along with possible solutions.

    "abstract": "Several Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications provide location-based services, wherein it is critical to obtain accurate position estimates by aggregating information from individual sensors. In the recently proposed narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) standard, which trades off bandwidth to gain wide coverage, the location estimation is compounded by the low sampling rate receivers and limited-capacity links. We address both of these NB-IoT drawbacks in the framework of passive sensing devices that receive signals from the target-of-interest. We consider the limiting case where each node receiver employs one-bit analog-to-digital-converters and propose a novel low-complexity nodal delay estimation method using constrained-weighted least squares minimization. To support the low-capacity links to the fusion center (FC), the range estimates obtained at individual sensors are then converted to one-bit data. At the FC, we propose target localization with the aggregated one-bit range vector using both optimal and sub-optimal techniques. The computationally expensive former approach is based on Lasserre's method for multivariate polynomial optimization while the latter employs our less complex iterative joint range-target location estimation (ANTARES) algorithm. Our overall one-bit framework not only complements the low NB-IoT bandwidth but also supports the design goal of inexpensive NB-IoT location sensing. Numerical experiments demonstrate feasibility of the proposed one-bit approach with a $0.6$% increase in the normalized localization error for the small set of $20$-$60$ nodes over the full-precision case. When the number of nodes is sufficiently large ($>80$), the one-bit methods yield the same performance as the full precision.",

    "abstract": "Existing wireless communication systems have been mainly designed to provide substantial gain in terms of data rates. However, 5G and Beyond will depart from this scheme, with the objective not only to provide services with higher data rates. One of the main goals is to support massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in the IoT applications. Supporting massive uplink (UP) communications for devices with sporadic traffic pattern and short-packet size, as it is in many mMTC use cases, is a challenging task, particularly when the control signaling is not negligible in size compared to the payload. Also, channel estimation is challenging for sporadic and short-packet transmission due to the limited number of employed pilots. In this paper, a new UP multiple access (MA) scheme is proposed for mMTC, which can support a large number of uncoordinated IoT devices with short-packet and sporadic traffic. The proposed UP MA scheme removes the overheads associated with the device identifier as well as pilots related to channel estimation. An alternative mechanism for device identification is proposed, where a unique spreading code is dedicated to each IoT device. This unique code is simultaneously used for the spreading purpose and device identification. Two IoT device identification algorithms which employ sparse signal reconstruction methods are proposed to determine the active IoT devices prior to data detection. Specifically, the BIC model order selection method is employed to develop an IoT device identification algorithm for unknown and time-varying probability of device activity. Our proposed MA scheme benefits from a non-coherent multiuser detection algorithm based on machine learning to enable data detection without a priori knowledge on channel state information. The effectiveness of the proposed MA scheme for known and unknown probability of activity is supported by simulation results.",

To lay the groundwork and start the conversation about disruptive changes that Bitcoin technology could bring to S2aaS concepts and IOT in general, we identify and discuss the core characteristics that could drive those changes. We present a conceptual example and describe the basic process of exchanging data for cash using Bitcoin.",

In this paper, we propose a new online checkpointing policy that judiciously determines when to checkpoint so as to minimize application time to completion while guaranteeing security. Compared to state-of-the-art checkpointing schemes that do not account for the overheads of encrypted checkpoints we improve execution time up to 1.4x.",

    "abstract": "Numerous energy harvesting wireless devices that will serve as building blocks for the Internet of Things (IoT) are currently under development. However, there is still only limited understanding of the properties of various energy sources and their impact on energy harvesting adaptive algorithms. Hence, we focus on characterizing the kinetic (motion) energy that can be harvested by a wireless node with an IoT form factor and on developing energy allocation algorithms for such nodes. In this paper, we describe methods for estimating harvested energy from acceleration traces. To characterize the energy availability associated with specific human activities (e.g., relaxing, walking, cycling), we analyze a motion dataset with over 40 participants. Based on acceleration measurements that we collected for over 200 hours, we study energy generation processes associated with day-long human routines. We also briefly summarize our experiments with moving objects. We develop energy allocation algorithms that take into account practical IoT node design considerations, and evaluate the algorithms using the collected measurements. Our observations provide insights into the design of motion energy harvesters, IoT nodes, and energy harvesting adaptive algorithms.",

Currently, such Internet-connected objects or `things' outnumber both people and computers connected to the Internet and their population is expected to grow to 50 billion in the next 5 to 10 years. To be able to develop IoT applications, such `things' must become dynamically integrated into emerging information networks supported by architecturally scalable and economically feasible Internet service delivery models, such as cloud computing. Achieving such integration through discovery and configuration of `things' is a challenging task. Towards this end, we propose a Context-Aware Dynamic Discovery of {Things} (CADDOT) model. We have developed a tool SmartLink, that is capable of discovering sensors deployed in a particular location despite their heterogeneity. SmartLink helps to establish the direct communication between sensor hardware and cloud-based IoT middleware platforms. We address the challenge of heterogeneity using a plug in architecture. Our prototype tool is developed on an Android platform. Further, we employ the Global Sensor Network (GSN) as the IoT middleware for the proof of concept validation. The significance of the proposed solution is validated using a test-bed that comprises 52 Arduino-based Libelium sensors.",

Following such an event, the availability of minimal communication services is however crucial to allow efficient and coordinated disaster response, to enable timely public information, or to provide individuals in need with a default mechanism to post emergency messages. The Internet of Things consists in the massive deployment of heterogeneous devices, most of which battery-powered, and interconnected via wireless network interfaces. Typical IoT communication architectures enables such IoT devices to not only connect to the communication backbone (i.e. the Internet) using an infrastructure-based wireless network paradigm, but also to communicate with one another autonomously, without the help of any infrastructure, using a spontaneous wireless network paradigm. In this paper, we argue that the vast deployment of IoT-enabled devices could bring benefits in terms of data network resilience in face of disaster. Leveraging their spontaneous wireless networking capabilities, IoT devices could enable minimal communication services (e.g. emergency micro-message delivery) while the conventional communication infrastructure is out of service. We identify the main challenges that must be addressed in order to realize this potential in practice. These challenges concern various technical aspects, including physical connectivity requirements, network protocol stack enhancements, data traffic prioritization schemes, as well as social and political aspects.",

Buildings as important parts of the smart grids, their energy efficiency is vital for the environment and global sustainability. Using a LEED-gold-certificated green office building, we built a unique IoT experimental testbed for our energy efficiency and building intelligence research. We first monitor and collect one-year-long building energy usage data and then systematically evaluate and analyze them. The results show that due to the centralized and static building controls, the actual running of green buildings may not be energy efficient even though they may be \"green\" by design. Inspired by \"energy proportional computing\" in modern computers, we propose a IoT framework with smart location-based automated and networked energy control, which uses smartphone platform and cloud computing technologies to enable multi-scale energy proportionality including building-, user-, and organizational-level energy proportionality. We further build a proof-of-concept IoT network and control system prototype and carried out real-world experiments which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

This dissertation is requirements- and development-focused Design Science research for distributed technology-sustained pervasive applications, incorporating knowledge from the domains of Distributed Computing, Mixed Reality, Context-Aware Computing, Geographical Information Systems and IoT. Computer video games have existed for decades, with a reusable game engine to drive them. If pervasive games can be understood as computer games interfacing with the physical world, can computer game engines be used to stage pervasive games? Considering the use of non-standard input devices in pervasive games and the rise of IoT, how will this affect the architectures supporting the broader set of pervasive applications? The use of a game engine can be found in some existing pervasive game projects, but general research into how the domain of pervasive games overlaps with that of video games is lacking. When an engine is used, a discussion of, what type of engine is most suitable and what properties are being fulfilled by the engine, is often not part of the discourse. This dissertation uses multiple iterations of the method framework for Design Science for the design and development of three software system architectures.

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the main component of IoT which collect data from the environment and transmit the data to the sink nodes. For long service time and low maintenance cost, WSNs require adaptive and robust designs to address many issues, e.g., data collection, topology formation, packet forwarding, resource and power optimization, coverage optimization, efficient task allocation, and security. For these issues, sensors have to make optimal decisions from current capabilities and available strategies to achieve desirable goals. This paper reviews numerous applications of the economic and pricing models, known as intelligent rational decision-making methods, to develop adaptive algorithms and protocols for WSNs. Besides, we survey a variety of pricing strategies in providing incentives for phone users in crowdsensing applications to contribute their sensing data. Furthermore, we consider the use of some pricing models in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication. Finally, we highlight some important open research issues as well as future research directions of applying economic and pricing models to IoT.",

    "abstract": "The human activity recognition in the IoT environment plays the central role in the ambient assisted living, where the human activities can be represented as a concatenated event stream generated from various smart objects. From the concatenated event stream, each activity should be distinguished separately for the human activity recognition to provide services that users may need. In this regard, accurately segmenting the entire stream at the precise boundary of each activity is indispensable high priority task to realize the activity recognition. Multiple human activities in an IoT environment generate varying event stream patterns, and the unpredictability of these patterns makes them include redundant or missing events. In dealing with this complex segmentation problem, we figured out that the dynamic and confusing patterns cause major problems due to: inclusive event stream, redundant events, and shared events. To address these problems, we exploited the contextual relationships associated with the activity status about either ongoing or terminated/started. To discover the intrinsic relationships between the events in a stream, we utilized the LSTM model by rendering it for the activity segmentation. Then, the inferred boundaries were revised by our validation algorithm for a bit shifted boundaries. Our experiments show the surprising result of high accuracy above 95%, on our own testbed with various smart objects. This is superior to the prior works that even do not assume the environment with multi-user activities, where their accuracies are slightly above 80% in their test environment. It proves that our work is feasible enough to be applied in the IoT environment.",

Altogether, 113 Brazilian individuals answered a survey about such dimensions. Although their perceptions seem to be dependent on the context, there are recurrent patterns. Our results suggest that IoT users can be classified into unconcerned, fundamentalists and pragmatists. Most of them exhibit a pragmatist profile and believe in privacy as a right guaranteed by law. One of the most privacy concerning aspect is the exchange of personal information to third parties. Individuals' perceived risk is negatively correlated with their perceived utility in the features of the system. We discuss practical implications of these results and suggest heuristics to cope with privacy concerns when designing IoT systems.",

    "abstract": "To fully empower sensor networks with cognitive Internet of Things (IoT) technology, efficient medium access control protocols that enable the coexistence of cognitive sensor networks with current wireless infrastructure are as essential as the cognitive power in data fusion and processing due to shared wireless spectrum. Cognitive radio (CR) is introduced to increase spectrum efficiency and support such an endeavor, which thereby becomes a promising building block toward facilitating cognitive IoT. In this paper, primary users (PUs) refer to devices in existing wireless infrastructure, and secondary users (SUs) refer to cognitive sensors. For interference control between PUs and SUs, SUs adopt dynamic spectrum access and power adjustment to ensure sufficient operation of PUs, which inevitably leads to increasing latency and poses new challenges on the reliability of IoT communications. To guarantee operations of primary systems while simultaneously optimizing system performance in cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs), this paper proposes interference-aware flooding schemes exploiting global timeout and vaccine recovery schemes to control the heavy buffer occupancy induced by packet replications. The information delivery dynamics of SUs under the proposed interference-aware recovery-assisted flooding schemes is analyzed via epidemic models and stochastic geometry from a macroscopic view of the entire system. The simulation results show that our model can efficiently capture the complicated data delivery dynamics in CRAHNs in terms of end-to-end transmission reliability and buffer occupancy. This paper sheds new light on analysis of recovery-assisted flooding schemes in CRAHNs and provides performance evaluation of cognitive IoT services built upon CRAHNs.",

    "abstract": "Spectrum reservation is emerging as one of the potential solutions to cater for the communication needs of massive number of wireless Internet of Things (IoT) devices with reliability constraints particularly in mission-critical scenarios. In most mission-critical systems, the true utility of a reservation may not be completely known ahead of time as the unforseen events might not be completely predictable. In this paper, we present a dynamic contract approach where an advance payment is made at the time of reservation based on partial information about spectrum reservation utility. Once the complete information is obtained, a rebate on the payment is made if the reservation is released. In this paper, we present a contract theoretic approach to design an incentivized mechanism that coerces the applications to reveal their true application type resulting in greater profitability of the IoT network operator. The operator offers a menu of contracts with advanced payments and rebate to the IoT applications without having knowledge about the types of applications. The decision of the applications in selecting a contract leads to a revelation of their true type to the operator which allows it to generate higher profits than a traditional spectrum auction mechanism. Under some assumptions on distribution of the utility of the applications, closed form solutions for the optimal dynamic spectrum reservation contract are provided and the sensitivity against system parameters is analyzed.",

For such settings, the traditional form of data analytics over the entire dataset would be prohibitively limiting and expensive for supporting real-time stream analytics. In this work, we make a case for approximate computing for data analytics in IoT settings. Approximate computing aims for efficient execution of workflows where an approximate output is sufficient instead of the exact output. The idea behind approximate computing is to compute over a representative sample instead of the entire input dataset. Thus, approximate computing - based on the chosen sample size - can make a systematic trade-off between the output accuracy and computation efficiency. This motivated the design of APPROXIOT - a data analytics system for approximate computing in IoT. To realize this idea, we designed an online hierarchical stratified reservoir sampling algorithm that uses edge computing resources to produce approximate output with rigorous error bounds. To showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm, we implemented APPROXIOT based on Apache Kafka and evaluated its effectiveness using a set of microbenchmarks and real-world case studies. Our results show that APPROXIOT achieves a speedup 1.3X-9.9X with varying sampling fraction of 80% to 10% compared to simple random sampling.",

These counterfeit hardware issues counterfeit hardware that have driven the need for more secure chip authentication. High entropy random numbers from physical sources are a critical component in authentication and encryption processes within secure systems [6]. Secure encryption is dependent on sources of truly random numbers for generating keys, and there is a need for an on chip random number generator to achieve adequate security. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) adopts a large number of these hardware-based security and prevention solutions in order to securely exchange data in resource efficient manner. In this work, we have developed several methodologies of hardware-based random functions in order to address the issues and enhance the security and trust of ICs: a novel DRAM-based intrinsic Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) [13] for system level security and authentication along with analysis of the impact of various environmental conditions, particularly silicon aging; a DRAM remanence based True Random Number Generation (TRNG) to produce random sequences with a very low overhead; a DRAM TRNG model using its startup value behavior for creating random bit streams; an efficient power supply noise based TRNG model for generating an infinite number of random bits which has been evaluated as a cost effective technique; architectures and hardware security solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT) environment.

However, large scale data management tasks still require significant amounts of resources that can be expensive regardless of whether they are purchased or rented (e.g. pay-as-you-go infrastructure). Further, not everyone is interested in such large scale data collection and analysis.

Therefore, a timely need exists for a cloud-integrated mobile crowd sensing platform that is capable of capturing sensors data, on-demand, based on conditions enforced by the data consumers.

The key aspect of the WoT to succeed is the relatively, easy-to-build ecosystems nature inherited from the web and the capacity for building end-to-end solutions. At the WoT connecting physical devices such as sensors, RFID tags or any devices that can send data through the Internet using the Web is almost automatic. The WoT shared data can be used to build smarter solutions that offer business services in the form of IoT applications. In this chapter, we review the main WoT challenges, with particular interest on highlighting those that rely on combining heterogeneous IoT data for the design of smarter services and applications and that benefit from data interoperability. Semantic web technologies help for overcoming with such challenges by addressing, among other ones the following objectives: 1) semantically annotating and unifying heterogeneous data, 2) enriching semantic WoT datasets with external knowledge graphs, and 3) providing an analysis of data by means of reasoning mechanisms to infer meaningful information. To overcome the challenge of building interoperable semantics-based IoT applications, the Machine-to-Machine Measurement (M3) semantic engine has been designed to semantically annotate WoT data, build the logic of smarter services and deduce meaningful knowledge by linking it to the external knowledge graphs available on the web. M3 assists application and business developers in designing interoperable Semantic Web of Things applications. Contributions in the context of European semantic-based WoT projects are discussed and a particular use case within FIESTA-IoT project is presented.",

We demonstrate the efficacy of the scheme and the performance advantage over existing schemes through simulations. %Next we study the application of network coding in the distributed cloud storage. Next we introduce the optimal storage allocation problem in the network coding based distributed cloud storage, which aims at searching for the most reliable allocation that distributes the $n$ data components into $N$ data centers, given the failure probability $p$ of each data center.

    "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of distributed resource allocation is studied for an Internet of Things (IoT) system, composed of a heterogeneous group of nodes compromising both machine-type devices (MTDs) and human-type devices (HTDs). The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game between the heterogeneous IoT devices that seek to find the optimal time allocation so as to meet their quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in terms of energy, rate and latency. Since the strategy space of each device is dependent on the actions of the other devices, the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) solution is first characterized, and the conditions for uniqueness of the GNE are derived. Then, to explicitly capture the heterogeneity of the devices, in terms of resource constraints and QoS needs, a novel and more realistic game-theoretic approach, based on the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy (CH) theory, is proposed. This approach is then shown to enable the IoT devices to reach a CH equilibrium (CHE) concept that takes into account the various levels of rationality corresponding to the heterogeneous computational capabilities and the information accessible for each one of the MTDs and HTDs. Simulation results show that the proposed CHE solution keeps the percentage of devices with satisfied QoS constraints above 96% for IoT networks containing up to 10,000 devices without considerably degrading the overall system performance.",

    "abstract": "RPL, an IPv6 routing protocol for Low power Lossy Networks (LLNs), is considered to be the de facto routing standard for the Internet of Things (IoT). However, more and more experimental results demonstrate that RPL performs poorly when it comes to throughput and adaptability to network dynamics. This significantly limits the application of RPL in many practical IoT scenarios, such as an LLN with high-speed sensor data streams and mobile sensing devices. To address this issue, we develop BRPL, an extension of RPL, providing a practical approach that allows users to smoothly combine any RPL Object Function (OF) with backpressure routing. BRPL uses two novel algorithms, QuickTheta and QuickBeta, to support time-varying data traffic loads and node mobility respectively. We implement BRPL on Contiki OS, an open-source operating system for the Internet of Things. We conduct an extensive evaluation using both real-world experiments based on the FIT IoT-LAB testbed and large-scale simulations using Cooja over 18 virtual servers on the Cloud. The evaluation results demonstrate that BRPL not only is fully backward compatible with RPL (i.e. devices running RPL and BRPL can work together seamlessly), but also significantly improves network throughput and adaptability to changes in network topologies and data traffic loads. The observed packet loss reduction in mobile networks is, at a minimum, 60% and up to 1000% can be seen in extreme cases.",

Hybrid simulation is a methodology that combines multiple modalities of modeling/simulation. Complex scenarios are decomposed into simpler ones, each one being simulated through a specific simulation strategy. All these simulation building blocks are then synchronized and coordinated. This simulation methodology is an ideal one to represent IoT setups, which are usually very demanding, due to the heterogeneity of possible scenarios arising from the massive deployment of an enormous amount of sensors and devices. We present a use case concerned with the distributed simulation of smart territories, a novel view of decentralized geographical spaces that, thanks to the use of IoT, builds ICT services to manage resources in a way that is sustainable and not harmful to the environment. Three different simulation models are combined together, namely, an adaptive agent-based parallel and distributed simulator, an OMNeT++ based discrete event simulator and a script-language simulator based on MATLAB.

    "abstract": "We consider time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation of a first arrival-path for a device working in narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) systems. Due to a limited 180 KHz bandwidth used in NB-IoT, the time-domain auto-correlation function (ACF) of transmitted NB positioning reference signal (NPRS) has a wide main lobe. Without considering that, the performance of ToA estimation can be degraded for two reasons. Firstly, under multiple-path channel environments, the NPRS corresponding to different received paths are superimposed on each other, and so are the cross-correlations corresponding to them. Secondly, the measured peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) used for detecting the presence of NPRS is inaccurate. Therefore, in this paper we propose a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) based method to jointly estimate the number of channel taps, the channel coefficients and the corresponding delays in NB-IoT systems, with considering the imperfect ACF of NPRS. Such a proposed method only uses the time-domain cross-correlations between the received signal and the transmitted NPRS, and has a low complexity. We show through simulations that, the ToA estimation of the proposed method performs close to the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for a single-path channel, and significantly outperforms a traditional ToA estimator that uses signal-to-noise (SNR) or power thresholds based estimation.",

Health aficionados and citizens are increasingly using IoT technologies to track their sleep, food intake, activity, vital body signals, and other physiological observations. This is complemented by IoT systems that continuously collect health-related data from the environment and inside the living quarters. Together, these have created an opportunity for a new generation of healthcare solutions. However, interpreting data to understand an individual's health is challenging. It is usually necessary to look at that individual's clinical record and behavioral information, as well as social and environmental information affecting that individual. Interpreting how well a patient is doing also requires looking at his adherence to respective health objectives, application of relevant clinical knowledge and the desired outcomes. We resort to the vision of Augmented Personalized Healthcare (APH) to exploit the extensive variety of relevant data and medical knowledge using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to extend and enhance human health to presents various stages of augmented health management strategies: self-monitoring, self-appraisal, self-management, intervention, and disease progress tracking and prediction. kHealth technology, a specific incarnation of APH, and its application to Asthma and other diseases are used to provide illustrations and discuss alternatives for technology-assisted health management.

    "abstract": "Wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs), where multiple energy-limited devices first harvest energy in the downlink and then transmit information in the uplink, have been envisioned as a promising solution for the future Internet-of-Things (IoT). Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been proposed to improve the system spectral efficiency (SE) of the fifth-generation (5G) networks by allowing concurrent transmissions of multiple users in the same spectrum. As such, NOMA has been recently considered for the uplink of WPCNs based IoT networks with a massive number of devices. However, simultaneous transmissions in NOMA may also incur more transmit energy consumption as well as circuit energy consumption in practice which is critical for energy constrained IoT devices. As a result, compared to orthogonal multiple access schemes such as time-division multiple access (TDMA), whether the SE can be improved and/or the total energy consumption can be reduced with NOMA in such a scenario still remains unknown. To answer this question, we first derive the optimal time allocations for maximizing the SE of a TDMA-based WPCN (T-WPCN) and a NOMA-based WPCN (N-WPCN), respectively. Subsequently, we analyze the total energy consumption as well as the maximum SE achieved by these two networks. Surprisingly, it is found that N-WPCN not only consumes more energy, but also is less spectral efficient than T-WPCN. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and unveil the fundamental performance bottleneck, i.e., \"worst user bottleneck problem\", in multiuser NOMA systems.",

Due to the large size and high cost of commercial energy measurement platforms, alternative solutions have been proposed by the research community. However, the three main shortcomings of existing tools are complexity, limited measurement range, and low accuracy. Specifically, these tools are not suitable for the energy measurement of new IoT devices such as those supporting the 802.11 technology. In this paper we propose EMPIOT, an accurate, low-cost, easy to build, and flexible power measurement platform. We present the hardware and software components of this platform and study the effect of various design parameters on accuracy and overhead. In particular, we analyze the effects of driver, bus speed, input voltage, and buffering mechanism on sampling rate, measurement accuracy and processing demand. These extensive experimental studies enable us to configure the system in order to achieve its highest performance. We also propose a novel calibration technique and report the calibration parameters under various settings. Using five different IoT devices performing four types of workloads, we evaluate the performance of EMPIOT against the ground truth obtained from a high-accuracy industrial-grade power measurement tool. Our results show that, for very low-power devices that utilize 802.15.4 wireless standard, the measurement error is less than 3.5%. In addition, for 802.11-based devices that generate short and high power spikes, the error is less than 2.5%.",

One such vulnerability is the zero-day threat that may lead to zero-day attacks which are detrimental to an enterprise as well as the network security. In this article, a study is presented on the zero-day threats for IoT networks and a context graph-based framework is presented to provide a strategy for mitigating these attacks. The proposed approach uses a distributed diagnosis system for classifying the context at the central service provider as well as at the local user site. Once a potential zero-day attack is identified, a critical data sharing protocol is used to transmit alert messages and reestablish the trust between the network entities and the IoT devices. The results show that the distributed approach is capable of mitigating the zero-day threats efficiently with 33% and 21% improvements in terms of cost of operation and communication overheads, respectively, in comparison with the centralized diagnosis system.",

By leveraging the underutilized radio spectrum, the cognitive radio (CR) technology is considered as a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. In parallel with the development of CR techniques, Wireless Energy Harvesting (WEH) is considered as one of the emerging technologies to eliminate the need of recharging or replacing the batteries for IoT and CR networks. To this end, we propose to utilize WEH for CR networks in which the CR devices are not only capable of sensing the available radio frequencies in a collaborative manner but also harvesting the wireless energy transferred by an Access Point (AP). More importantly, we design an optimization framework that captures a fundamental tradeoff between energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) of the network. In particular, we formulate a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem that maximizes EE while taking into consideration of users' buffer occupancy, data rate fairness, energy causality constraints and interference constraints. We further prove that the proposed optimization framework is an NP-Hard problem. Thus, we propose a low complex heuristic algorithm, called INSTANT, to solve the resource allocation and energy harvesting optimization problem. The proposed algorithm is shown to be capable of achieving near optimal solution with high accuracy while having polynomial complexity. The efficiency of our proposal is validated through well designed simulations.",

While the scale of these applications is enormous, device capabilities, particularly in terms of battery life and energy efficiency are limited. Despite research being done to ameliorate these shortcomings, wireless IoT networks still cannot guarantee satisfactory network lifetimes and prolonged sensing coverage. Moreover, proposed schemes in literature are convoluted and cannot be easily implemented in real-world scenarios. This necessitates the development of a simple yet energy efficient routing scheme for wireless IoT sensor networks. This paper models the energy constraint problem of devices in IoT applications as an optimization problem. To conserve the energy of device nodes, the routing protocol first aggregates devices into clusters based on a number of different features such as distance from base station, data/message length and data sensed from the environment in the current epoch. Then, a cluster head is elected for each cluster and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is generated with all the cluster heads as nodes. Edges represent communication intent from transmitter to receiver and the edge weights are computed using a formulated equation. The minimum cost path to the base station is computed to allow for efficient real-time routing. Sleep scheduling is also optionally used to further boost network energy efficiency. The proposed routing protocol has been simulated and outperforms existing routing protocols in terms of metrics such as number of active nodes, energy dynamics and network coverage.",

With estimations of billions of sensors and devices to be connected in the coming years, the IoT has been advocated as having a great potential to impact the way we live, but also how we work. However, the connectivity aspect in itself only accounts for the underlying M2M infrastructure. In order to properly support engineering IoT systems and applications, it is key to orchestrate heterogeneous 'things' in a seamless, adaptive and dynamic manner, such that the system can exhibit a goal-directed behaviour and take appropriate actions. Yet, this form of interaction between things needs to take a user-centric approach and by no means elude the users' requirements. To this end, contextualisation is an important feature of the system, allowing it to infer user activities and prompt the user with relevant information and interactions even in the absence of intentional commands. In this work we propose a role-based model for emergent configurations of connected systems as a means to model, manage, and reason about IoT systems including the user's interaction with them. We put a special focus on integrating the user perspective in order to guide the emergent configurations such that systems goals are aligned with the users' intentions.

There are two main approaches to handle the surge in the uplink (UL) traffic the IoT is expected to generate, namely, Scheduled UL (SC-UL) and random access uplink (RA-UL) transmissions. SC-UL is perceived as a viable tool to control Quality-of-Service (QoS) levels while entailing some overhead in the scheduling request prior to any UL transmission. On the other hand, RA-UL is a simple single-phase transmission strategy. While this obviously eliminates scheduling overheads, very little is known about how scalable RA-UL is. At this critical junction, there is a dire need to analyze the scalability of these two paradigms. To that end, this paper develops a spatiotemporal mathematical framework to analyze and assess the performance of SC-UL and RA-UL. The developed paradigm jointly utilizes stochastic geometry and queueing theory. Based on such a framework, we show that the answer to the \"scheduling vs. random access paradox\" actually depends on the operational scenario. Particularly, RA-UL scheme offers low access delays but suffers from limited scalability, i.e., cannot support a large number of IoT devices. On the other hand, SC-UL transmission is better suited for higher device intensities and traffic rates.",

Recent advances advocate the use of an antenna array to extract fine-grained physical-layer signatures to mitigate these active attacks. However, it adds burdens in terms of energy consumption and hardware cost that IoT devices cannot afford. To overcome this predicament, we present ShieldScatter, a lightweight system that attaches battery-free backscatter tags to single-antenna devices to shield the system from active attacks. The key insight of ShieldScatter is to intentionally create multi-path propagation signatures with the careful deployment of backscatter tags. These signatures can be used to construct a sensitive profile to identify the location of the signals' arrival, and thus detect the threat. We prototype ShieldScatter with USRPs and ambient backscatter tags to evaluate our system in various environments. The experimental results show that even when the attacker is located only 15 cm away from the legitimate device, ShieldScatter with merely three backscatter tags can mitigate 97% of spoofing attack attempts while at the same time trigger false alarms on just 7% of legitimate traffic.",

Specifically, we define an energy consumption (EC) model that captures the energy cost---of transceiver circuitry, power amplifier, packet error statistics, packet overhead, etc.---in delivering a useful data bit. We derive the EC models for an ideal and two realistic non-linear power amplifier models. To incorporate packet error statistics, we develop a simple, in the form of elementary functions, and accurate closed-form packet error rate (PER) approximation in Rayleigh block-fading. Using the EC models, we derive energy-optimal yet reliability and hardware compliant conditions for limiting unconstrained optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and payload size. Together with these conditions, we develop a semi-analytic algorithm for resource-constrained IoT devices to jointly optimize parameters on physical (modulation size, SNR) and MAC (payload size and the number of retransmissions) layers in relation to link distance. Our results show that despite reliability constraints, the common notion---higher $M$-ary QAM modulations are energy optimal for short-range communication---prevails, and can provide up to 180% lifetime extension as compared to often employed OQPSK modulation in IoT devices. However, the reliability constraints reduce both their range and the energy efficiency, while non-ideal traditional PA reduces the range further by 50%, and diminishes the energy gains unless a better PA is employed.",

Given the high cost associated with a vast deployment of totally trusted information sources, the IoT-enabled monitoring services also subsist on citizen engagement and on (possibly untrusted) users' sensing apparatus for data collection. However, trust management becomes a key factor in the success of such services because they might be misled by malicious users through altered or fake sensor data. In this paper, we consider a monitoring service, and propose a hybrid entity/data trust computation scheme which relies on Bayesian learning to score the users (as data reporters), and on Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) for data fusion and for the computation of the trustworthiness of the data itself. In order to provide resiliency against behavioral changes, the probability masses used in DST are dynamically updated using the freshly estimated user scores as well as the contextual properties associated with the reported data. We conduct simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of our scheme. Compared to prior work, the results demonstrate superior performance in terms of accuracy and resilience against malicious behavior.",

    "abstract": "The growing pervasiveness of Internet of Things (IoT) expands the attack surface by connecting more and more attractive attack targets, i.e. embedded devices, to the Internet. One key component in securing these devices is software integrity checking, which typically attained with Remote Attestation (RA). RA is realized as an interactive protocol, whereby a trusted party, verifier, verifies the software integrity of a potentially compromised remote device, prover. In the vast majority of IoT applications, smart devices operate in swarms, thus triggering the need for efficient swarm attestation schemes. In this paper, we present WISE, the first intelligent swarm attestation protocol that aims to minimize the communication overhead while preserving an adequate level of security. WISE depends on a resource-efficient smart broadcast authentication scheme where devices are organized in fine-grained multi-clusters, and whenever needed, the most likely compromised devices are attested. The candidate devices are selected intelligently taking into account the attestation history and the diverse characteristics (and constraints) of each device in the swarm. We show that WISE is very suitable for resource-constrained embedded devices, highly efficient and scalable in heterogenous IoT networks, and offers an adjustable level of security.",

Due to the on-demand services and scalability features of cloud computing, Big Data application processing is done in the cloud infrastructure. Managing Big Data applications exclusively in the cloud is not an efficient solution for latency-sensitive applications related to smart transportation systems, healthcare solutions, emergency response systems and content delivery applications. Thus, the Fog computing paradigm that allows applications to perform computing operations in-between the cloud and the end devices has emerged. In Fog architecture, IoT devices and sensors are connected to the Fog devices which are located in close proximity to the users and it is also responsible for intermediate computation and storage. Most computations will be done on the edge by eliminating full dependencies on the cloud resources. In this chapter, we investigate and survey Fog computing architectures which have been proposed over the past few years. Moreover, we study the requirements of IoT applications and platforms, and the limitations faced by cloud systems when executing IoT applications. Finally, we review current research works that particularly focus on Big Data application execution on Fog and address several open challenges as well as future research directions.",

The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a new algorithm for following mobile monitored targets/individuals in the context of an IoT system, especially a dynamic one as the aforementioned.

Complete geometrical, numerical, simulation, and convergence analyses of the proposed technique are thoroughly presented, along with a detailed simulation-based evaluation that reveals the higher following accuracy of Hot-Cold compared to the popular concept of trilateration-based tracking.

Although there are a number of real-world frameworks attempt to support such integration, they have many limitations from various perspectives including platform independence, security, resource management and multi-application assistance. To address these limitations, we propose a simplified but effective framework, named FogBus for facilitating end-to-end IoT-Fog(Edge)-Cloud integration. FogBus offers a platform independent interface to IoT applications and computing instances for execution and interaction. It not only assists developers in building applications but also helps users in running multiple applications at a time and service providers to manage their resources. In addition, FogBus applies Blockchain, authentication and encryption techniques to secure operations on sensitive data. Because of its lightweight and cross platform software systems, it is easy to deploy, scalable and cost e_cient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by creating a computing environment with it that integrates finger pulse oximeter as IoT devices with Smartphone-based gateway and Raspberry Pi-based Fog nodes for Sleep Apnea analysis. We also run several experiments on this computing environment varying FogBus settings. The experimental results show that different FogBus settings can improve latency, energy, network and CPU usage of the computing infrastructure.",

However, the limited memory and computation power of low-end IoT devices prevent the direct usage of conventional identification systems. RF fingerprinting is a promising technique to identify low-end IoT devices since it only requires the RF signals that most IoT devices can produce for communication. However, most existing RF fingerprinting systems are data-dependent and/or not robust to impacts from wireless channels. To address the above problems, we propose to exploit the mathematical expression of the physical-layer process, regarded as a function $\\mathbf{\\mathcal{F}(\\cdot)}$, for device identification. $\\mathbf{\\mathcal{F}(\\cdot)}$ is not directly derivable, so we further propose a model to learn it and employ this function model as the device fingerprint in our system, namely $\\mathcal{F}$ID. Our proposed function model characterizes the unique physical-layer process of a device that is independent of the transmitted data, and hence, our system $\\mathcal{F}$ID is data-independent and thus resilient against signal replay attacks. Modeling and further separating channel effects from the function model makes $\\mathcal{F}$ID channel-robust. We evaluate $\\mathcal{F}$ID on thousands of random signal packets from $33$ different devices in different environments and scenarios, and the overall identification accuracy is over $99\\%$.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) interconnects multiple physical devices in large-scale networks. When the 'things' coordinate decisions and act collectively on shared information, feedback is introduced between them. Multiple feedback loops are thus closed over a shared, general-purpose network. Traditional feedback control is unsuitable for design of IoT control because it relies on high-rate periodic communication and is ignorant of the shared network resource. Therefore, recent event-based estimation methods are applied herein for resource-aware IoT control allowing agents to decide online whether communication with other agents is needed, or not. While this can reduce network traffic significantly, a severe limitation of typical event-based approaches is the need for instantaneous triggering decisions that leave no time to reallocate freed resources (e.g., communication slots), which hence remain unused. To address this problem, novel predictive and self triggering protocols are proposed herein. From a unified Bayesian decision framework, two schemes are developed: self triggers that predict, at the current triggering instant, the next one; and predictive triggers that check at every time step, whether communication will be needed at a given prediction horizon. The suitability of these triggers for feedback control is demonstrated in hardware experiments on a cart-pole, and scalability is discussed with a multi-vehicle simulation.",

    "abstract": "Wireless connectivity for the Internet of Things (IoT) requires combining low latency and high reliability with power and cost constraints. On top of that, diverse applications and end-to-end services with very different performance requirements should ideally share the same network infrastructure. Software defined networks (SDN) were defined to allow this coexistence, but they have seen very limited adoption in IoT systems due to the inherent resource constrained nature of the wireless devices. Additionally, the low-power nature of IoT communication standards does not usually allow for physically separated control and data channels, which is a basic requirement for real-time network slicing. In this work, we propose a SDN implementation for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which has become the de-facto technology for IoT applications. The proposed BLE mesh structure is able to use different protocols for different services, ensuring a clear separation between control and data channels while still being sent over the wireless medium. A proof-of-concept for the proposed SDN implementation is given in a real BLE mesh testbed, where measurements show how the system is able to automatically detect and recover from network congestion by identifying the nodes responsible of such situation and reconfiguring their parameters over the air.",

A large volume of data steadily come out of a large number of sensors in the monitoring system. Thus, we need to consider how to store and manage these data. Existing time series databases (TSDBs) can be used for monitoring data storage, but they do not have good models for describing the data streams stored in the database. In this paper, we develop a semantic model for the specification of the monitoring data streams (time series data) in terms of which sensor generated the data stream, which metric of which entity the sensor is monitoring, what is the relation of the entity to other entities in the system, which measurement unit is used for the data stream, etc. We have also developed a tool suite, SE-TSDB, that can run on top of existing TSDBs to help establish semantic specifications for data streams and enable semantic-based data retrievals. With our semantic model for monitoring data and our SE-TSDB tool suite, users can retrieve non-existing data streams that can be automatically derived from the semantics. Users can also retrieve data streams without knowing where they are. Semantic based retrieval is especially important in a large-scale integrated IoT-Edge-Cloud system, because of its sheer quantity of data, its huge number of computing and IoT devices that may store the data, and the dynamics in data migration and evolution. With better data semantics, data streams can be more effectively tracked and flexibly retrieved to help with timely data analysis and control decision making anywhere and anytime.",

Digital signatures offer scalable authentication with non-repudiation and public verifiability, which are necessary for auditing and dispute resolution in such IoT applications. However, digital signatures have been shown to be highly costly for low-end IoT devices, especially when embedded devices (e.g., medical implants) must operate without a battery replacement for a long time. We propose an Energy-aware Signature for Embedded Medical devices (ESEM) that achieves near-optimal signer efficiency. ESEM signature generation does not require any costly operations (e.g., elliptic curve (EC) scalar multiplication/addition), but only a small constant-number of pseudo-random function calls, additions, and a single modular multiplication. ESEM has the smallest signature size among its EC-based counterparts with an identical private key size. We achieve this by eliminating the use of the ephemeral public key (i.e, commitment) in Schnorr-type signatures from the signing via a distributed construction at the verifier without interaction with the signer while permitting a constant-size public key. We proved that ESEM is secure (in random oracle model), and fully implemented it on an 8-bit AVR microcontroller that is commonly used in medical devices. Our experiments showed that ESEM achieves 8.4x higher energy efficiency over its closest counterpart while offering a smaller signature and code size. Hence, ESEM can be suitable for deployment on resource limited embedded devices in IoT. We open-sourced our software for public testing and wide-adoption.",

The goal is to design a resource allocation algorithm that jointly maximizes the network lifetime and the performance of the data analytics tasks subject to energy constraints. This joint maximization problem is challenging with coupled resource constraints that induce non-convexity. We first show that the problem can be mapped to an equivalent convex problem, and then propose an online algorithm that provably solves the problem and does not require any a priori knowledge of the time-varying wireless link capacities and data analytics arrival process statistics. The algorithm's optimality properties are derived using an analysis which, to the best of our knowledge, proves for the first time the convergence of the dual subgradient method with time-varying sets. Our simulations seeded by real IoT device energy measurements, show that the network connectivity plays a crucial role in network lifetime maximization, that the algorithm can obtain both maximum network lifetime and maximum data analytics performance in addition to maximizing the joint objective, and that the algorithm increases the network lifetime by approximately 50% compared to an algorithm that minimizes the total energy consumption.",

Existing approaches typically separate the DNN model development step from its deployment on IoT devices, resulting in suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we first introduce a few interesting but counterintuitive observations about such a separate design approach, and empirically show why it may lead to suboptimal designs. Motivated by these observations, we then propose a novel and practical bi-directional co-design approach: a bottom-up DNN model design strategy together with a top-down flow for DNN accelerator design. It enables a joint optimization of both DNN models and their deployment configurations on IoT devices as represented as FPGAs.

    "abstract": "With the increasing connectivity enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), security becomes a critical concern, and the users should invest to secure their IoT applications. Due to the massive devices in the IoT network, users cannot be aware of the security policies taken by all its connected neighbors. Instead, a user makes security decisions based on the cyber risks he perceives by observing a selected number of nodes. To this end, we propose a model which incorporates the limited attention or bounded rationality nature of players in the IoT. Specifically, each individual builds a sparse cognitive network of nodes to respond to. Based on this simplified cognitive network representation, each user then determines his security management policy by minimizing his own real-world security cost. The bounded rational decision-makings of players and their cognitive network formations are interdependent and thus should be addressed in a holistic manner. We establish a games-in-games framework and propose a Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) solution concept to characterize the decisions of agents, and quantify their risk of bounded perception due to the limited attention. In addition, we design a proximal-based iterative algorithm to compute the GNE. With case studies of smart communities, the designed algorithm can successfully identify the critical users whose decisions need to be taken into account by the other users during the security management.",

    "abstract": "The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the development of many complex and critical systems such as smart emergency management systems. IoT-enabled applications typically depend on a communication network for transmitting large volumes of data in unpredictable and changing environments. These networks are prone to congestion when there is a burst in demand, e.g., as an emergency situation is unfolding, and therefore rely on configurable software-defined networks (SDN). In this paper, we propose a dynamic adaptive SDN configuration approach for IoT systems. The approach enables resolving congestion in real time while minimizing network utilization, data transmission delays and adaptation costs. Our approach builds on existing work in dynamic adaptive search-based software engineering (SBSE) to reconfigure an SDN while simultaneously ensuring multiple quality of service criteria. We evaluate our approach on an industrial national emergency management system, which is aimed at detecting disasters and emergencies, and facilitating recovery and rescue operations by providing first responders with a reliable communication infrastructure. Our results indicate that (1) our approach is able to efficiently and effectively adapt an SDN to dynamically resolve congestion, and (2) compared to two baseline data forwarding algorithms that are static and non-adaptive, our approach increases data transmission rate by a factor of at least 3 and decreases data loss by at least 70%.",

However, porting JS applications to the large variety of IoT devices, specifically on System-on-a-Chip (SoCs) devices (\\eg~Arduino Uno, Particle \\photon), is challenging because these devices are constrained in terms of memory and storage capacity. Running JS applications adds an overhead of resources to deploy a code interpreter on the devices. Also, running JS applications may not be possible ``as is'' on some device missing some hardware/software capabilities. To address this problem, we propose \\momit~a multiobjective optimization approach to miniaturize JS applications to run on IoT constrained devices. To validate \\momit, we miniaturize a JS interpreter to execute a testbed comprised of 23 applications and measure their performances before and after applying the miniaturization process. We implement \\momit~using three different search algorithms and found that it can reduce code size, memory usage, and CPU time by median values of 31\\%, 56\\%, and 36\\% respectively.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a cross-layer framework for optimizing user association, packet offloading rates, and bandwidth allocation for Mission-Critical Internet-of-Things (MC-IoT) services with short packets in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems, where enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) services with long packets are considered as background services. To reduce communication delay, the 5th generation new radio is adopted in radio access networks. To avoid long queueing delay for short packets from MC-IoT, Processor-Sharing (PS) servers are deployed at MEC systems, where the service rate of the server is equally allocated to all the packets in the buffer. We derive the distribution of latency experienced by short packets in closed-form, and minimize the overall packet loss probability subject to the end-to-end delay requirement. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose an algorithm that converges to a near optimal solution when the throughput of eMBB services is much higher than MC-IoT services, and extend it into more general scenarios. Furthermore, we derive the optimal solutions in two asymptotic cases: communication or computing is the bottleneck of reliability. Simulation and numerical results validate our analysis and show that the PS server outperforms first-come-first-serve servers.",

    "abstract": "Security provisioning has become the most important design consideration for large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems due to their critical roles to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogenous devices, machines and industry processes. Conventional authentication and authorization schemes are insufficient in dealing the emerging IoT security challenges due to their reliance on both static digital mechanisms and computational complexity for improving security level. Furthermore, the isolated security designs for different layers and link segments while ignoring the overall protection lead to cascaded security risks as well as growing communication latency and overhead. In this article, we envision new artificial intelligence (AI) enabled security provisioning approaches to overcome these issues while achieving fast authentication and progressive authorization. To be more specific, a lightweight intelligent authentication approach is developed by exploring machine learning at the gateway to identify the access time slots or frequencies of resource-constraint devices. Then we propose a holistic authentication and authorization approach, where online machine learning and trust management are adopted for analyzing the complex dynamic environment and achieving adaptive access control. These new AI enabled approaches establish the connections between transceivers quickly and enhance security progressively, so that communication latency can be reduced and security risks are well-controlled in large-scale IoT. Finally, we outline several areas for AI-enabled security provisioning for future researches.",

    "abstract": "The internet of things (IoT) is transforming major industries including but not limited to healthcare, agriculture, finance, energy, and transportation. IoT platforms are continually improving with innovations such as the amalgamation of software-defined networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) in the edge-cloud interplay. Deep learning (DL) is becoming popular due to its remarkable accuracy when trained with a massive amount of data, such as generated by IoT. However, DL algorithms tend to leak privacy when trained on highly sensitive crowd-sourced data such as medical data. Existing privacy-preserving DL algorithms rely on the traditional server-centric approaches requiring high processing powers. We propose a new local differentially private (LDP) algorithm named LATENT that redesigns the training process. LATENT enables a data owner to add a randomization layer before data leave the data owners' devices and reach a potentially untrusted machine learning service. This feature is achieved by splitting the architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN) into three layers: (1) convolutional module, (2) randomization module, and (3) fully connected module. Hence, the randomization module can operate as an NFV privacy preservation service in an SDN-controlled NFV, making LATENT more practical for IoT-driven cloud-based environments compared to existing approaches. The randomization module employs a newly proposed LDP protocol named utility enhancing randomization, which allows LATENT to maintain high utility compared to existing LDP protocols. Our experimental evaluation of LATENT on convolutional deep neural networks demonstrates excellent accuracy (e.g. 91%- 96%) with high model quality even under low privacy budgets (e.g. $\\varepsilon=0.5$).",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm that allows to set large networks of small and independent devices. To ensure their integrity, practitioners employ so-called Remote Attestation (RA) schemes. Classic RA schemes require a central and powerful entity, called Verifier, that has mainly two duties: (i) it manages the entire process of attestation, and (ii) it contains all the proofs for validating the devices' integrity. However, having a central Verifier makes the network dependent upon an external entity and introduces a single point of failure for security. In this work, we propose SAFE^d: the first RA schema that allows a pair of IoT devices to validate their integrity without relying on an external Verifier. Our approach overcomes previous limitations by spreading the proofs among multiple IoT devices and using novel cryptographic mechanisms to ensure secure communications. Moreover, the entire IoT network can collaboratively isolate tampered devices and recover missing proofs in case of anomalies. We evaluate our schema through an implementation for Raspberry Pi platform and a network simulation. The results show that SAFE^d can detect infected devices and recover up to 99.9% of proofs in case of faults or attacks. Moreover, we managed to protect up to 10K devices with a logarithmic overhead on the network and on the devices' memory.",

To this purpose, the paper presents the WoT Store, a complete software platform enabling the discovery and management of W3C Things, the monitoring of its properties and events, and the invoking of actions, all within the same dashboard. In addition, the platform leverages on the semantic description of each Thing with the goal of easing and automatizing the installation and execution of WoT applications, e.g. defining the behaviour of a Thing or implementing mash-up operations from multiple Things. We sketch the main features, the architecture and the prototypal implementation of the WoT Store.

To provide users with context-aware services and lighten the transmission burden, the raw data usually needs to be preprocessed before being transmitted to the destination. However, the effect of computing on the overall information freshness is not well understood. In this work, we first develop an analytical framework to investigate the information freshness, in terms of peak age of information (PAoI), of a computing enabled IoT system with multiple sensors. Specifically, we model the procedure of computing and transmission as a tandem queue, and derive the analytical expressions of the average PAoI for different sensors. Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a min-max optimization problem to minimize the maximum average PAoI of different sensors. We further design a derivative-free algorithm to find the optimal updating frequency, with which the complexity for checking the convexity of the formulated problem or obtaining the derivatives of the object function can be largely reduced. The accuracy of our analysis and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are verified with extensive simulation results.",

The DS18B20 and INA219 sensors investigated and analyzed the dependence of FTP multimedia data transmission speed on wireless Wi-Fi network on the temperature of the switch processor, temperature. The environment and the current and voltage consumed by the switch. Advantages of sensors with GPIO interface over analog meters for this experiment are revealed. Much of the work is devoted to the development of automation of results from GPIO interfaces, which helped eliminate human error and get more accurate metrics. Measurement automation was developed using Python 3.7 programming language. Using the INA219 library we were able to obtain current and voltage indicators from the ina219 board. To get temperature indicators sufficiently built into Python libraries to read temperature files in Raspbian. The article focuses on the synchronicity of measurement results records for more accurate analysis. Therefore, an FTP client was developed that measures the download speed of the file from the FTP server and records the results simultaneously with temperature, current and voltage measurements. To this end, attention is drawn to the multithreading in Python programming language and the transmission of commands using TCP sockets in that language. As a result, the dependence of the measured factors was calculated using the Pearson correlation formula. These measurement factors affect the autonomy and energy consumption, which is very important for IoT devices, and therefore, among the devices tested, recommendations were made regarding their choice when used depending on the conditions.",

With this in mind, we have developed a solution for managing user profiles based on privacy and evolution. For that, we define the criteria and characteristics for each environment. The contribution of the work also applies to the evolution of the UbiPri Middleware, with a module implemented and tested according to the rules of environments so that they can modify the user's profile over time according to their frequency in the environment. The modified profile can be raised, reduced and blocked. This implementation has been validated using scripts that perform probabilistic simulation and user authentication. From the rules assigned to the environments, it was possible to perceive the high adaptability of the implementation, and it can be easily adjusted to any IoT environment that wants to treat the authentication and privacy of environments and users. The results obtained were satisfactory and could be useful for both the evolution of the UbiPri Middleware and other related works.",

On the merits of low power consumption, portability, and non-intrusiveness, there are no suitable IoT solutions that can provide information comparable to the conventional Electrocardiography (ECG). In this paper, we propose an IoT device utilizing a spintronic ultra-sensitive sensor that measures the magnetic fields produced by cardio-vascular electrical activity, i.e. Magentocardiography (MCG). After that, we treat the low-frequency noise generated by the sensors, which is also a challenge for most other sensors dealing with low-frequency bio-magnetic signals. Instead of relying on generic signal processing techniques such as averaging or filtering, we employ deep-learning training on bio-magnetic signals. Using an existing dataset of ECG records, MCG labels are synthetically constructed. A unique deep learning structure composed of combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is trained using the labeled data moving through a striding window, which is able to smartly capture and eliminate the noise features. Simulation results are reported to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method that demonstrates encouraging performance.",

    "abstract": "Many IoT use cases involve constrained battery-powered devices offering services in a RESTful manner to their communication partners. Such services may involve, e.g., costly computations or actuator/sensor usage, which may have significant influence on the power consumption of the service Providers. Remote attackers may excessively use those services in order to exhaust the Providers' batteries, which is a form of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Previous work proposed solutions based on lightweight symmetric authentication. These solutions scale poorly due to requiring pre-shared keys and do not provide protection against compromised service Requesters. In contrast, we consider more powerful attackers even capable of compromising legit Requesters. We propose a method that combines attacker detection and throttling, conducted by a third trusted Backend, with a lightweight authentication protocol. For attacker detection and throttling, we propose a novel approach using rate limitation algorithms. In addition, we propose and formally verify two authentication protocols suitable for different, widely used IoT network topologies. Our protocols ensure service availability for benign Requesters even if Providers are under a battery exhaustion attack. The protocols do neither require pre-shared keys between Requesters and Providers, nor the usage of asymmetric cryptography and public key infrastructures on the Provider. This makes our protocols suitable for a variety of IoT deployments involving constrained devices and constrained networks. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method through a simulation and a proof of concept implementation.",

This paper presents a repeated game model to enhance clustered WSNs-based IoT security and DT against the selective forwarding (SF) attack. Besides, the model is capable of detecting the hardware (HW) failure of the cluster members (CMs) and conserve the power consumption due to packet retransmission. The model relies on TDMA protocol to facilitate the detection process and to avoid collision between the delivered packets at the cluster head (CH). The proposed model aims to keep packets transmitting, isotropic or non-isotropic transmission, from the CMs to the CH for maximizing the DT and aims to distinguish between the malicious CM and the one suffering from HW failure. Accordingly, it can manage the consequently lost power due to the malicious attack effect or HW malfunction. Simulation results indicate the proposed mechanism improved performance with TDMA over six different environments against the SF attack that achieves the Pareto optimal DT as compared to a non-cooperative defense mechanism.",

However, this information cannot be entrusted to any one device, since the failure of that device or an attack on it will jeopardize the security of the entire network. Even if the information is divided among devices, there is still the danger that an attacker can compromise a group of devices and expose the sensitive information. In this work, we design and implement a secure and robust scheme to enable the distribution of sensitive information in IoT networks. The proposed approach has two important properties: (1) it uses Threshold Secret Sharing (TSS) to split the information into pieces distributed among all devices in the system - and so the information can only be retrieved collaboratively by groups of devices; and (2) it ensures the privacy and integrity of the information, even when attackers hijack a large number of devices and use them in concert - specifically, all the compromised devices can be identified, the confidentiality of information is kept, and authenticity of the secret can be guaranteed.",

Age of information (AoI) is a time-evolving metric that accounts for the packet inter-arrival and waiting times to assess the freshness of information. In the foreseen large-scale IoT networks, mutual interference imposes a delicate relation between traffic generation patterns and transmission delays. To this end, we provide a spatiotemporal framework that captures the peak AoI (PAoI) for large scale IoT uplink network under time-triggered (TT) and event triggered (ET) traffic. Tools from stochastic geometry and queueing theory are utilized to account for the macroscopic and microscopic network scales. Simulations are conducted to validate the proposed mathematical framework and assess the effect of traffic load on PAoI. The results unveil a counter-intuitive superiority of the ET traffic over the TT in terms of PAoI, which is due to the involved temporal interference correlations. Insights regarding the network stability frontiers and the location-dependent performance are presented.

    "abstract": "The consumer Internet of Things (IoT) space has experienced a significant rise in popularity in the recent years. From smart speakers, to baby monitors, and smart kettles and TVs, these devices are increasingly found in households around the world while users may be unaware of the risks associated with owning these devices. Previous work showed that these devices can threaten individuals' privacy and security by exposing information online to a large number of service providers and third party analytics services. Our analysis shows that many of these Internet connections (and the information they expose) are neither critical, nor even essential to the operation of these devices. However, automatically separating out critical from non-critical network traffic for an IoT device is nontrivial, and requires expert analysis based on manual experimentation in a controlled setting. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to automatically classify network traffic destinations as either critical (essential for devices to function properly) or not, hence allowing the home gateway to act as a selective firewall to block undesired, non-critical destinations. Our initial results demonstrate that some IoT devices contact destinations that are not critical to their operation, and there is no impact on device functionality if these destinations are blocked. We take the first steps towards designing and evaluating IoTrimmer, a framework for automated testing and analysis of various destinations contacted by devices, and selectively blocking the ones that do not impact device functionality.",

    "abstract": "The freshness of status information is of great importance for time-critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications. A metric measuring status freshness is the age-of-information (AoI), which captures the time elapsed from the status being generated at the source node (e.g., a sensor) to the latest status update.However, in intelligent IoT applications such as video surveillance, the status information is revealed after some computation intensive and time-consuming data processing operations, which would affect the status freshness. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, age-of-processing (AoP), to quantify such status freshness, which captures the time elapsed of the newest received processed status data since it is generated. Compared with AoI, AoP further takes the data processing time into account. Since an IoT device has limited computation and energy resource, the device can choose to offload the data processing to the nearby edge server under constrained status sampling frequency.We aim to minimize the average AoP in a long-term process by jointly optimizing the status sampling frequency and processing offloading policy. We formulate this online problem as an infinite-horizon constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with average reward criterion. We then transform the CMDP problem into an unconstrained Markov decision process (MDP) by leveraging a Lagrangian method, and propose a Lagrangian transformation framework for the original CMDP problem. Furthermore, we integrate the framework with perturbation based refinement for achieving the optimal policy of the CMDP problem. Extensive numerical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks, with an average AoP reduction up to 30%.",

    "abstract": "More and more emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications involve status updates, where various IoT devices monitor certain physical processes and report their latest statuses to the relevant information fusion nodes. A new performance measure, termed the age of information (AoI), has recently been proposed to quantify the information freshness in time-critical IoT applications. Due to a large number of devices in future IoT networks, the decentralized channel access protocols (e.g. random access) are preferable thanks to their low network overhead. Built on the AoI concept, some recent efforts have developed several AoI-oriented ALOHA-like random access protocols for boosting the network-wide information freshness. However, all relevant works focused on theoretical designs and analysis. The development and implementation of a working prototype to evaluate and further improve these random access protocols in practice have been largely overlooked. Motivated as such, we build a software-defined radio (SDR) prototype for testing and comparing the performance of recently proposed AoI-oriented random access protocols. To this end, we implement a time-slotted wireless system by devising a simple yet effective over-the-air time synchronization scheme, in which beacons that serve as reference timing packets are broadcast by an access point from time to time. For a complete working prototype, we also design the frame structures of various packets exchanged within the system. Finally, we design a set of experiments, implement them on our prototype and test the considered algorithms in an office environment.",

The 3D mobility of UAVs can be exploited to improve node localization in IoT networks for, e.g., search and rescue or goods localization and tracking. One of the widespread IoT communication technologies is Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), which allows achieving long communication distances with low power. In this work, we present a drone-aided localization system for LoRa networks in which a UAV is used to improve the estimation of a node's location initially provided by the network. We characterize the relevant parameters of the communication system and use them to develop and test a search algorithm in a realistic simulated scenario. We then move to the full implementation of a real system in which a drone is seamlessly integrated into Swisscom's LoRa network. The drone coordinates with the network with a two-way exchange of information which results in an accurate and fully autonomous localization system. The results obtained in our field tests show a ten-fold improvement in localization precision with respect to the estimation provided by the fixed network. Up to our knowledge, this is the first time a UAV is successfully integrated in a LoRa network to improve its localization accuracy.",

Typically, in SMCS, a task requester aims to recruit a subset of IoT devices and commission them to travel to the task location. However, because of the exponential increase of IoT networks and their diversified devices (e.g., multiple brands, different communication channels, etc.), recruiting the appropriate devices/workers is becoming a challenging task. To this end, in this paper, we develop a recruitment process for SMCS platforms using automated SIoT service discovery to select trustworthy workers satisfying the requester requirements. The method we purpose includes mainly two stages: 1) a worker filtering stage, aiming at reducing the workers' search space to a subset of potential trustworthy candidates using the Louvain community detection algorithm (CD) applied to SIoT relation graphs. Next, 2) a selection process stage that uses an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to determine the final set of selected devices/workers. The ILP maximizes a worker efficiency metric incorporating the skills/specs level, recruitment cost, and trustworthiness level of the recruited IoT devices. Selected experiments analyze the performance of the proposed CD-ILP algorithm using a real-world dataset and show its superiority in providing an effective recruitment strategy compared to an existing stochastic algorithm.",

    "abstract": "IoT devices have been adopted widely in the last decade which enabled collection of various data from different environments. The collected data is crucial in certain applications where IoT devices generate data for critical infrastructure or systems whose failure may result in catastrophic results. Specifically, for such critical applications, data storage poses challenges since the data may be compromised during the storage and the integrity might be violated without being noticed. In such cases, integrity and data provenance are required in order to be able to detect the source of any incident and prove it in legal cases if there is a dispute with the involved parties. To address these issues, blockchain provides excellent opportunities since it can protect the integrity of the data thanks to its distributed structure. However, it comes with certain costs as storing huge amount of data in a public blockchain will come with significant transaction fees. In this paper, we propose a highly cost effective and reliable digital forensics framework by exploiting multiple inexpensive blockchain networks as a temporary storage before the data is committed to Ethereum. To reduce Ethereum costs,we utilize Merkle trees which hierarchically stores hashes of the collected event data from IoT devices. We evaluated the approach on popular blockchains such as EOS, Stellar, and Ethereum by presenting a cost and security analysis. The results indicate that we can achieve significant cost savings without compromising the integrity of the data.",

    "abstract": "The wide acceptance of Internet of Things (IoT) for both household and industrial applications is accompanied by several security concerns. A major security concern is their probable abuse by adversaries towards their malicious intent. Understanding and analyzing IoT malicious behaviors is crucial, especially with their rapid growth and adoption in wide-range of applications. However, recent studies have shown that machine learning-based approaches are susceptible to adversarial attacks by adding junk codes to the binaries, for example, with an intention to fool those machine learning or deep learning-based detection systems. Realizing the importance of addressing this challenge, this study proposes a malware detection system that is robust to adversarial attacks. To do so, examine the performance of the state-of-the-art methods against adversarial IoT software crafted using the graph embedding and augmentation techniques. In particular, we study the robustness of such methods against two black-box adversarial methods, GEA and SGEA, to generate Adversarial Examples (AEs) with reduced overhead, and keeping their practicality intact. Our comprehensive experimentation with GEA-based AEs show the relation between misclassification and the graph size of the injected sample. Upon optimization and with small perturbation, by use of SGEA, all the IoT malware samples are misclassified as benign. This highlights the vulnerability of current detection systems under adversarial settings. With the landscape of possible adversarial attacks, we then propose DL-FHMC, a fine-grained hierarchical learning approach for malware detection and classification, that is robust to AEs with a capability to detect 88.52% of the malicious AEs.",

The IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) associated with smart city, healthcare, Industry 4.0 and Agtech handle a huge volume of data and require data processing services from different types of applications in real-time. The Cloud-centric execution of IoT applications barely meets such requirements as the Cloud datacentres reside at a multi-hop distance from the IoT devices. \\textit{Fog computing}, an extension of Cloud at the edge network, can execute these applications closer to data sources. Thus, Fog computing can improve application service delivery time and resist network congestion. However, the Fog nodes are highly distributed, heterogeneous and most of them are constrained in resources and spatial sharing. Therefore, efficient management of applications is necessary to fully exploit the capabilities of Fog nodes. In this work, we investigate the existing application management strategies in Fog computing and review them in terms of architecture, placement and maintenance. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy and highlight the research gaps in Fog-based application management. We also discuss a perspective model and provide future research directions for further improvement of application management in Fog computing.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of low cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices demands new encryption mechanisms over their wireless communication channel. Traditional public key cryptography (PKC) demands high computational power and is not suitable for low power IoT devices, making them vulnerable to more powerful eavesdroppers. Recent advances in physical layer security (PLS) exploits common wireless channel statistics to generate symmetrical keys, but require accurate channel estimation and a high communication signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As most embedded and underground IoT devices operate in low communication SNR regimes, they cannot reliably use either PKC nor PLS encryption. Many IoT devices monitor underground networked assets such as water, oil, gas, and electrical networks. Here, we propose to exploit the monitored physical dynamics data to act as a basis for encrypting the digital information. Graph Layer Security (GLS) is proposed for the first time here, as a way to encode networked physical assets' information via their graph signal processing properties. Our approach is premised on the exploitation of networked correlation in nonlinear physical dynamics for encryption and decryption. We achieve this using Koopman operator linearisation and Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) sparsification. The resulting GLS encryption scheme, like PLS, do not require the exchange of keys or a public key, and is not reliant on wireless channel properties. Using real world examples, we demonstrate remarkably secure wireless communication encryption. We believe the technology has widespread applicability in secure health monitoring for Digital Twins in challenging radio environments and conclude our seminal paper with a discussion on future development challenges.",

Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF), utilizing the unique device-based information, can be a promising solution for IoT. However, traditional RFFs have become obsolete because of low reliability and reduced user capability. Our proposed solution, Metasurface RF-Fingerprinting Injection (MeRFFI), is to inject a carefully-designed radio frequency fingerprint into the wireless physical layer that can increase the security of a stationary IoT device with minimal overhead. The injection of fingerprint is implemented using a low cost metasurface developed and fabricated in our lab, which is designed to make small but detectable perturbations in the specific frequency band in which the IoT devices are communicating. We have conducted comprehensive system evaluations including distance, orientation, multiple channels where the feasibility, effectiveness, and reliability of these fingerprints are validated.

Edge servers can recruit many mobile devices to contribute computing power together to mining and share the reward of mining with these recruited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose an incentivizing mechanism based on edge computing for mobile blockchain. We design a two-stage Stackelberg Game to jointly optimize the reward of edge servers and recruited mobile devices. The edge server as the leader sets the expected fee for the recruited mobile devices in Stage I. The mobile device as a follower provides its computing power to mine according to the expected fee in Stage. It proves that this game can obtain a uniqueness Nash Equilibrium solution under the same or different expected fee. In the simulation experiment, we obtain a result curve of the profit for the edge server with the different ratio between the computing power from the edge server and mobile devices.

Unfortunately, the main energy efficiency mechanisms of 802.11, namely PSM and APSD, fall short when used in IoT applications. PSM increases latency and intensifies channel access contention after each beacon instance, and APSD does not inform stations about when they need to wake up to receive their downlink packets. In this paper, we present a new mechanism---edge-assisted predictive sleep scheduling (EAPS)---to adjust the sleep duration of stations while they expect downlink packets. We first implement a Linux-based access point that enables us to collect parameters affecting communication latency. Using this access point, we build a testbed that, in addition to offering traffic pattern customization, replicates the characteristics of real-world environments. We then use multiple machine learning algorithms to predict downlink packet delivery. Our empirical evaluations confirm that when using EAPS the energy consumption of IoT stations is as low as PSM, whereas the delay of packet delivery is close to the case where the station is always awake.",

Fog nodes of varying response rates are available to the cloud service provider (CSP) and it is faced with a challenge of forwarding the sequentially received IoT data to one of the fog nodes for processing. Since the arrival times and nature of requests is random, it is important to optimally classify the requests in real-time and allocate available virtual machine instances (VMIs) at the fog nodes to provide a high QoE to the users and consequently generate higher revenues for the CSP. In this paper, we use a pricing policy based on the QoE of the applications as a result of the allocation and obtain an optimal dynamic allocation rule based on the statistical information of the computational requests.

A public request is made for witness statements on the data of a target IoT that is transmitted on its local network, and subsequently, devices (in close vicinity of the target IoT) offer witnessing service. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We develop a system architecture based on blockchain and smart contract that enables authorities to dynamically avail a verification service for data of a subject device from a distributed set of witnesses which are willing to provide (in a privacy-preserving manner) their local wireless measurement in exchange of monetary return; (2) We then develop a method to optimally select witnesses in such a way that the verification error is minimized subject to monetary cost constraints; (3) Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of our scheme using real Wi-Fi session traces collected from a five-storeyed building with more than thirty access points, representative of a hospital.

    "abstract": "Small, low-cost IoT devices are typically equipped with only a single, low-quality antenna, significantly limiting communication range and link quality. In particular, these antennas are typically linearly polarized and therefore susceptible to polarization mismatch, which can easily cause 10-15 dBm of link loss on communication to and from such devices. In this work, we highlight this under-appreciated issue and propose the augmentation of IoT deployment environments with programmable, RF-sensitive surfaces made of metamaterials. Our smart meta-surface mitigates polarization mismatch by rotating the polarization of signals that pass through or reflect off the surface. We integrate our metasurface into an IoT network as LAMA, a Low-power Lattice of Actuated Metasurface Antennas, designed for the pervasively used 2.4 GHz ISM band. We optimize LAMA's metasurface design for both low transmission loss and low cost, to facilitate deployment at scale. We then build an end-to-end system that actuates the metasurface structure to optimize for link performance in real time. Our experimental prototype-based evaluation demonstrates gains in link power of up to 15 dBm, and wireless capacity improvements of 100 and 180 Kbit/s/Hz in through-surface and surface-reflective scenarios, respectively, attributable to the polarization rotation properties of LAMA'S metasurface.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart applications is spurring the adoption of machine learning as a key technology enabler. To overcome the privacy and overhead challenges of centralized machine learning, there has been a significant recent interest in the concept of federated learning. Federated learning offers on-device, privacy-preserving machine learning without the need to transfer end-devices data to a third party location. However, federated learning still has privacy concerns due to sensitive information inferring capability of the aggregation server using end-devices local learning models. Furthermore, the federated learning process might fail due to a failure in the aggregation server (e.g., due to a malicious attack or physical defect). Other than privacy and robustness issues, federated learning over IoT networks requires a significant amount of communication resources for training. To cope with these issues, we propose a novel concept of dispersed federated learning (DFL) that is based on the true decentralization. We opine that DFL will serve as a practical implementation of federated learning for various IoT-based smart applications such as smart industries and intelligent transportation systems. First, the fundamentals of the DFL are presented. Second, a taxonomy is devised with a qualitative analysis of various DFL schemes. Third, a DFL framework for IoT networks is proposed with a matching theory-based solution. Finally, an outlook on future research directions is presented.",

The paper aims to describe the new testbed architecture used to collect Linux datasets from audit traces of hard disk, memory and process. The architecture was designed in three distributed layers of edge, fog, and cloud. The edge layer comprises IoT and network systems, the fog layer includes virtual machines and gateways, and the cloud layer includes data analytics and visualization tools connected with the other two layers. The layers were programmatically controlled using Software-Defined Network (SDN) and Network-Function Virtualization (NFV) using the VMware NSX and vCloud NFV platform. The Linux ToN IoT datasets would be used to train and validate various new federated and distributed AI-enabled security solutions such as intrusion detection, threat intelligence, privacy preservation and digital forensics. Various Data analytical and machine learning methods are employed to determine the fidelity of the datasets in terms of examining feature engineering, statistics of legitimate and security events, and reliability of security events.

Especially in Internet of Things (IoT) services, UAV equipped with communication equipments is widely adopted as a mobile base station (BS) for data collection from IoT devices on the ground. In this paper, we consider an air-ground network in which the UAV flies straightly to collect information from the IoT devices in a 2-D plane based on the CSMA/CA protocol. Due to UAV's continuous mobility, the communication durations of devices in different locations with UAV are not only time-limited, but also vary from each other. To analyze the throughput performance of uplink multiple access control (MAC) protocol, we propose a new analysis model to deal with the communications heterogeneity in the network. Firstly, we divide the devices in the coverage into different clusters according to their communication durations. Then, a quitting probability indicating the probability that a device quits the UAV's coverage at each time slot is clarified. A modified three-dimensional Markov chain model adopting the quitting probability and cluster division is developed for the performance analysis. Besides, we also propose a modified CSMA/CA protocol which fully considers the heterogeneity of the access time and adaptively allocates the time resource among the devices in different clusters. Finally, the effects of retry limit, initial contention window size, the density of the devices, UAVs speed and coverage area are discussed in the simulation section.",

However, the actual use of EIoT over significant timescales has not been empirically analyzed. In other words, the reality remains unexplored. Furthermore, despite the variety of EIoT verticals, the use of IoT across vertical industries has not been compared. This paper uses a two-year EIoT dataset from a major Finnish mobile network operator to investigate device use across industries, cellular traffic patterns, and mobility patterns. We present a variety of novel findings: EIoT traffic volume per device has increased three-fold over the last two years, the share of LTE-enabled devices has remained low at around 2% and that 30% of EIoT devices are still 2G only, and there are order of magnitude differences between different industries' EIoT traffic and mobility. We also show that daily traffic can be clustered into only three patterns, differing mainly in the presence and timing of a peak hour. Beyond these descriptive results, modeling and forecasting is conducted for both traffic and mobility. We forecast the total daily EIoT traffic through a temporal regression model and achieve an error of about 15% over medium-term (30 to 180 day) horizons. We also model device mobility through a Markov mixture model and quantify the upper bound of predictability for device mobility.",

Network data features has a great impact on the performances of ML-based NIDSs. However, evaluating ML models often are not reliable, as each ML-enabled NIDS is trained and validated using different data features that may do not contain security events. Therefore, a common ground feature set from multiple datasets is required to evaluate an ML model's detection accuracy and its ability to generalise across datasets. This paper presents NetFlow features from four benchmark NIDS datasets known as UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, ToN-IoT, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 using their publicly available packet capture files. In a real-world scenario, NetFlow features are relatively easier to extract from network traffic compared to the complex features used in the original datasets, as they are usually extracted from packet headers. The generated Netflow datasets have been labelled for solving binary- and multiclass-based learning challenges. Preliminary results indicate that NetFlow features lead to similar binary-class results and lower multi-class classification results amongst the four datasets compared to their respective original features datasets. The NetFlow datasets are named NF-UNSW-NB15, NF-BoT-IoT, NF-ToN-IoT, NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 and NF-UQ-NIDS are published at http://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/marius/NIDS_datasets/ for research purposes.",

As processes are enhanced with sensor and actuator technology, they become digitally interconnected and merge into an Internet of Things (IoT) to form cyber-physical systems (CPS). Using these automated systems, enterprises can improve the performance and quality of their operations. However, currently it is neither feasible nor reasonable to equip any machine with full autonomy when networking with other machines or people. It is necessary to specify rules for machine behavior that also determine an adequate degree of autonomy to realize the potential benefits of the IoT. Yet, there is a lack of methodologies and guidelines to support the design and implementation of machines as explicit autonomous agents such that many designs only consider autonomy implicitly. To address this research gap, we perform a comprehensive literature review to extract 12 requirements for the design of autonomous agents in the IoT. We introduce a set of constitutive characteristics for agents and introduce a classification framework for interactions in multi-agent systems. We integrate our findings by developing a conceptual modeling language consisting of a meta model and a notation that facilitates the specification and design of autonomous agents within the IoT as well as CPS: the Autonomy Model and Notation. We illustrate and discuss the approach and its limitations.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) in particular, play a vital role in providing smart services to the industry. These techniques however suffer from privacy and security concerns since data is collected from clients and then stored and processed at a central location. Federated Learning (FL), an architecture in which model parameters are exchanged instead of client data, has been proposed as a solution to these concerns. Nevertheless, FL trains a global model by communicating with clients over communication rounds, which introduces more traffic on the network and increases the convergence time to the target accuracy. In this work, we solve the problem of optimizing accuracy in stateful FL with a budgeted number of candidate clients by selecting the best candidate clients in terms of test accuracy to participate in the training process. Next, we propose an online stateful FL heuristic to find the best candidate clients. Additionally, we propose an IoT client alarm application that utilizes the proposed heuristic in training a stateful FL global model based on IoT device type classification to alert clients about unauthorized IoT devices in their environment. To test the efficiency of the proposed online heuristic, we conduct several experiments using a real dataset and compare the results against state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results indicate that the proposed heuristic outperforms the online random algorithm with up to 27% gain in accuracy. Additionally, the performance of the proposed online heuristic is comparable to the performance of the best offline algorithm.",

Recently, the TLS 1.3 standard was released and DTLS 1.3 is in the final stages of standardization. In this paper, we give an overview of version 1.3 of these protocols, and we provide the first experimental comparative performance analysis of different implementations and various configurations of these protocols, on real IoT devices based on low-power microcontrollers. We show how different implementations lead to different compromises. We measure and compare bytes-over-the-air, memory footprint, and energy consumption. We show that, when DTLS/TLS 1.3 requires more resources than DTLS/TLS 1.2, this additional overhead is quite reasonable. We also observe that, in some configurations, DTLS/TLS 1.3 actually decreases overhead and resource consumption. All in all, our study indicates that there is still room to optimize the existing implementations of these protocols.",

So far, many botnet detection techniques have been proposed but their performance is limited to a specific dataset on which they are trained. This is because the features used to train a machine learning model on one botnet dataset, do not perform well on other datasets due to the diversity of attack patterns.

So far, channel measurements at sea have mainly been conducted with antennas placed a couple of meters above the sea surface, which is higher than the buoys themselves. Therefore, we investigated the validity of the published channel models at sea by means of path loss measurements using a LoRa link with a transmitter antenna height of 0.35 m and a base station antenna height of 2.65 m and 5.2 m. Our results show that the round earth loss model is not accurate at these antenna heights. The ITU-R P.2001-3 model and a model by Bullington show a better agreement with our measurements. However, the difference between our two measurement campaigns shows that more investigation is needed on the dependence of the path loss on the sea state. Additionally, the availability of Sigfox, Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), and The Things Network at sea has been explored. We found that NB-IoT and Sigfox can be used for IoT applications in the tested area at low antenna heights.",

We design a prototype of transmit power pool (PP) to provide open-loop power control. IoT users acquire their transmit power in advance from this prototype PP solely according to their communication distances. Firstly, a multi-agent deep Q-network (DQN) aided GF-NOMA algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal transmit power levels for the prototype PP. More specifically, each IoT user acts as an agent and learns a policy by interacting with the wireless environment that guides them to select optimal actions. Secondly, to prevent the Q-learning model overestimation problem, double DQN based GF-NOMA algorithm is proposed. Numerical results confirm that the double DQN based algorithm finds out the optimal transmit power levels that form the PP. Comparing with the conventional online learning approach, the proposed algorithm with the prototype PP converges faster under changing environments due to limiting the action space based on previous learning.

In both paradigms, single-board small computers like Raspberry Pis (RPis) are widely used as the computing nodes. RPis are usually equipped with processors having moderate speed and provide supports for peripheral interfacing and networking. These features make RPis well-suited to deal with IoT-driven operations such as data sensing, analysis and actuation. However, RPis are constrained in facilitating multi-tenancy and resource sharing. The management of RPi-based computing and peripheral resources through centralized entities further degrades their performance and service quality significantly. To address these issues, a framework, named \\textit{Con-Pi} is proposed in this work. It exploits the concept of containerization and harnesses Docker containers to run IoT applications as microservices on RPis. Moreover, Con-Pi operates in a distributed manner across multiple RPis and enables them to share resources. The software system of the proposed framework also provides a scope to integrate different application, resource and energy management policies for Edge and Fog computing. The performance of the proposed framework is compared with the state-of-the-art frameworks by means of real-world experiments.

This paper develops a novel blockchain-based transactive energy management system for IoT-aided smart homes. We consider a holistic set of options for smart homes to participate in transactive energy. Smart homes can interact with the grid to perform vertical transactions, e.g., feeding in extra solar energy to the grid and providing demand response service to alleviate the grid load. Smart homes can also interact with peer users to perform horizontal transactions, e.g., peer-to-peer energy trading. However, conventional transactive energy management method suffers from the drawbacks of low efficiency, privacy leakage, and single-point failure. To address these challenges, we develop a privacy-preserving distributed algorithm that enables users to optimally manage their energy usages in parallel via the smart contract on the blockchain. Further, we design an efficient blockchain system tailored for IoT devices and develop the smart contract to support the holistic transactive energy management system. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility and performance of the blockchain-based transactive energy management system through extensive simulations and experiments. The results show that the blockchain-based transactive energy management system is feasible on practical IoT devices and reduces the overall cost by 25%.",

In this paper, an analysis of MAC and routing protocols for IoT is provided with focus on the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and the IETF RPL standards. It is shown that existing routing metrics do not account for the complex interactions between MAC and routing, and thus novel metrics are proposed. This enables a protocol selection mechanism for selecting the routing option and adapting the MAC parameters, given specific performance constraints. Extensive analytical and experimental results show that the behavior of the MAC protocol can hurt the performance of the routing protocol and vice versa, unless these two are carefully optimized together by the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "This paper advocates the use of the distributed compressed sensing (DCS) paradigm to deploy energy harvesting (EH) Internet of Thing (IoT) devices for energy self-sustainability. We consider networks with signal/energy models that capture the fact that both the collected signals and the harvested energy of different devices can exhibit correlation. We provide theoretical analysis on the performance of both the classical compressive sensing (CS) approach and the proposed distributed CS (DCS)-based approach to data acquisition for EH IoT. Moreover, we perform an in-depth comparison of the proposed DCS-based approach against the distributed source coding (DSC) system. These performance characterizations and comparisons embody the effect of various system phenomena and parameters including signal correlation, EH correlation, network size, and energy availability level. Our results unveil that, the proposed approach offers significant increase in data gathering capability with respect to the CS-based approach, and offers a substantial reduction of the mean-squared error distortion with respect to the DSC system.",

The framework can receivee services based on context information leaving the current infrastructure unchanged. This framework allows the active collaboration of heterogeneous devices and protocols. Moreover it is capable to model placement of physical objects, manage the system and to collect information for services deployed on an IoT infrastructure. Our proposed IoT virtualization is applicable to a random topology scenario which makes it possible to 1) share flow sensors resources 2) establish multioperational sensor networks, and 3) extend reachability within the framework without establishing any further physical networks. Flow sensors achieve better results comparable to the typical sensors with respect to packet generation, reachability, simulation time, throughput, energy consumption point of view. Even better results are possible through utilizing multicast groups in large scale networks.",

Hence, the usage-context-estimation from the unreliable Smart-device sensed data is justified as an unsupervised and non-linear optimization problem. Accordingly, Autonomic Happy IoT Management is aimed at attracting initial user-groups based on the common interests (i.e. recruitment ), then uncovering their latent usage-contexts from unreliable sensed data (i.e. revenue-renewal ) and synchronizing to usage-context dynamics (i.e. stochastic monetization). In this context, we have proposed an unsupervised online Bayesian mechanism, namely Whiz (Greek word, meaning Smart), in which, (a) once latent user-groups are initialized (i.e measurement model ), (b) usage-context is iteratively estimated from the unreliable sensed data (i.e. learning model ), (c) followed by online filtering of Bayesian knowledge about usage-context (i.e. filtering model ). Finally, we have proposed an Expectation Maximization (EM)-based iterative algorithm Whiz, which facilitates Happy IoT by solving (a) recruitment, (b) revenue-renewal and (c) stochastic- monetization problems with (a) measurement, (b) learning, and (c) filtering models, respectively.",

Moreover, these traditional solutions do not consider the case where a user wishes to control the granularity of the disclosed information based on the context of their use (e.g. based on the time or the current location of the user).

    "abstract": "In the Urban Internet of Things devices and systems are interconnected at the city scale to provide innovative services to the citizens.However, the traffic generated by the sensing and processing systems may overload local access networks. A coexistence problem arises where concurrent applications mutually interfere and compete for available resources. This effect is further aggravated by the multiple scales involved and heterogeneity of the networks supporting the urban IoT. One of the main contributions of this paper is the introduction of the notion of content-oriented cognitive interference control in heterogeneous local access networks supporting computing and data processing in the urban IoT. A network scenario where multiple communication technologies, such as Device-to-Device and Long Term Evolution (LTE), is considered. The focus of the present paper is on city monitoring applications, where a video data stream generated by a camera system is remotely processed to detect objects. The cognitive network paradigm is extended to dynamically shape the interference pattern generated by concurrent data streams and induce a packet loss trajectory compatible with video processing algorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed cognitive transmission strategy enables a significant throughput increase of interfering applications for a target accuracy of the monitoring application.",

Mobility is one of the key aspects that need to be evaluated when considering the different scenarios of the IoT. Small Worlds in Motion (SWIM) is a mobility model that mathematically characterises the movement patterns of humans. The work presented in this paper details the development and verification of the SWIM mobility model in the OMNeT++ simulator.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on cognitive radio (CR) internet- of-things (IoT) networks where spectrum sensors are deployed for IoT CR devices, which do not have enough hardware capability to identify an unoccupied spectrum by themselves. In this sensor- enabled IoT CR network, the CR devices and the sensors are separated. It induces that spectrum occupancies at locations of CR devices and sensors could be different. To handle this difference, we investigate a conditional interference distribution (CID) at the CR device for a given measured interference at the sensor. We can observe a spatial correlation of the aggregate interference distribution through the CID. Reflecting the CID, we devise a cognitive random access scheme which adaptively adjusts transmission probability with respect to the interference measurement of the sensor. Our scheme improves area spectral efficiency (ASE) compared to a conventional ALOHA and an adaptive transmission scheme which attempts to send data when the sensor measurement is lower than an interference threshold.",

    "abstract": "We consider channel estimation (CE) in narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) systems. Due to the fluctuations in phase within receiver and transmitter oscillators, and also the residual frequency offset (FO) caused by discontinuous receiving of repetition coded transmit data-blocks, random phase noises are presented in received signals. Although the coherent-time of fading channel can be assumed fairly long due to the low-mobility of NB-IoT user-equipments (UEs), such phase noises have to be considered before combining the the channel estimates over repetition copies to improve their accuracies. In this paper, we derive a sequential minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) channel estimator in the presence of random phase noise that refines the CE sequentially with each received repetition copy, which has a low-complexity and a small data storage. Further, we show through simulations that, the proposed sequential MMSE estimator improves the mean-square-error (MSE) of CE by 1 dB in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, compared to a traditional sequential MMSE estimator that does not thoroughly consider the impact of random phase noises.",

Secondly, based on the SLD operation, we propose a low complexity hybrid precoding scheme, named HYP-SLD. Specifically, for each low-rank sub-channel, we formulate the hybrid precoding design as a sparse reconstruction problem and separately maximizes the spectral efficiency. Finally, we further propose a maximum ratio combining based diversity combining scheme, named HYP-SLD-MRC, to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of mmWave IoT systems. Simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed HYP-SLD scheme significantly reduces the complexity of the classic orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) scheme. Moreover, the proposed HYP-SLD-MRC scheme achieves great improvement in BER performance compared with the fully digital precoding scheme.",

The basic idea is to use a digital potentiometer connected to a parallel resistor network controlled through digital switches. The resistance and output frequency of ProCal is controlled by a software communicating with the board through the SPI interface. Our design provides a simple synchronization mechanism which prevents the need for accurate time synchronization. We present mathematical modeling and validation of the tool by incorporating the concept of Fibonacci sequence. Our extensive experimental studies show that this tool can significantly improve measurement accuracy. For example, for ATMega2560, the ADC error reduces from 0.2% to 0.01%.

We begin by examining clock drift on two standard IoT prototyping platforms. We observe clock drift on the order of seconds over relatively short time periods, as well as poor clock rate stability, each of which make standard synchronization protocols ineffective. To address this problem, we develop a synchronization system, which includes a lightweight client, a new packet exchange protocol called SPoT and a scalable reference server. We evaluate the efficacy of our system over a range of configurations, operating conditions and target platforms. We find that SPoT performs synchronization 22x and 17x more accurately than MQTT and SNTP, respectively, at high noise levels, and maintains a clock accuracy of within ~15ms at various noise levels.

In this review, we discuss successful applications of spintronic sensors in electrical current sensing, transmission and distribution lines monitoring, vehicle detection, and biodetection. Traditional monitoring systems with limited sensors and wired communication can merely collect fragmented data in the application domains. In this paper, the wireless spintronic sensor networks (WSSNs) will be proposed and illustrated to provide pervasive monitoring systems, which facilitate the intelligent surveillance and management over building, power grid, transport, and healthcare. The database of collected information will be of great use to the policy making in public services and city planning. This work provides insights for realizing smart living through the integration of IoT with spintronic sensor technology.",

RFID based position estimation, in particular, is expected to facilitate a wide array of location based services for IoT applications with low-power requirements. In this paper, considering monostatic and bistatic configurations and 3D antenna radiation pattern, we investigate the accuracy of received signal strength based wireless localization using passive ultra high frequency (UHF) RFID systems. The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization accuracy is derived, and is compared with the accuracy of maximum likelihood estimators for various RFID antenna configurations. Numerical results show that due to RFID tag/antenna sensitivity, and the directional antenna pattern, the localization accuracy can degrade at blind locations that remain outside of the RFID reader antennas' main beam patterns. In such cases optimizing elevation angle of antennas are shown to improve localization coverage, while using bistatic configuration improves localization accuracy significantly.",

Based on this information, a dedicated camera interface, implemented on a low-power FPGA, wakes up an ultra-low-power parallel processing unit to extract context-aware visual information.

Triggering accuracy comparable to RGB image sensors is achieved at nominal lighting conditions, while consuming an average power between $193\\mu W$ and $277\\mu W$, depending on context activity.

The specific target application scenarios includes resource constrained environments where a co-located swarm of devices (adversarial in mission or objective) is also present. CHIRP, and its secured version (S-CHIRP), enables complete peer-to-peer communication of a $n$-agent network of devices in as few as n rounds. In addition to the n-round cycle length, the proposed communication mechanism has the following major properties: nodes communication is entirely decentralized, communication is resilient to the loss of nodes, and finally communication is resilient to the (re)-entry of nodes. Theoretical models show that even the secure implementation of this mechanism is capable of scaling to IoT swarms in the million device range with memory constraints in the < 10 MB range",

In this paper, we study the impact of coexisting competing radio access technologies on the system performance. Considering $\\mathpzc K$ technologies, defined by time and frequency activity factors, bandwidth, and power, which share a set of radio resources, we derive closed-form expressions for the successful transmission probability, expected battery lifetime, and experienced delay as a function of distance to the serving access point. Our analytical model, which is validated by simulation results, provides a tool to evaluate the coexistence scenarios and analyze how introduction of a new coexisting technology may degrade the system performance in terms of success probability and battery lifetime.

    "abstract": "The IoT is a network of interconnected everyday objects called things that have been augmented with a small measure of computing capabilities. Lately, the IoT has been affected by a variety of different botnet activities. As botnets have been the cause of serious security risks and financial damage over the years, existing Network forensic techniques cannot identify and track current sophisticated methods of botnets. This is because commercial tools mainly depend on signature-based approaches that cannot discover new forms of botnet. In literature, several studies have conducted the use of Machine Learning ML techniques in order to train and validate a model for defining such attacks, but they still produce high false alarm rates with the challenge of investigating the tracks of botnets. This paper investigates the role of ML techniques for developing a Network forensic mechanism based on network flow identifiers that can track suspicious activities of botnets. The experimental results using the UNSW-NB15 dataset revealed that ML techniques with flow identifiers can effectively and efficiently detect botnets attacks and their tracks.",

The underpinning of SecureTag is a signal processing technique that extracts the peculiar propagation characteristics of creeping waves to discern on-body devices. Upon overhearing a suspicious transmission, SecureTag initiates a PHY-based challenge-response protocol to mitigate attacks.

Each ACC provides one access control method for a subject-object pair, and implements both static access right validation based on predefined policies and dynamic access right validation by checking the behavior of the subject. The JC implements a misbehavior-judging method to facilitate the dynamic validation of the ACCs by receiving misbehavior reports from the ACCs, judging the misbehavior and returning the corresponding penalty. The RC registers the information of the access control and misbehavior-judging methods as well as their smart contracts, and also provides functions (e.g., register, update and delete) to manage these methods. To demonstrate the application of the framework, we provide a case study in an IoT system with one desktop computer, one laptop and two Raspberry Pi single-board computers, where the ACCs, JC and RC are implemented based on the Ethereum smart contract platform to achieve the access control.",

For example, how to quickly and effectively authenticate masses of bio-information uploaded by IoT terminals without revealing the owners' sensitive information. Therefore, we propose a large-scale concurrent data anonymous batch verification scheme for MHCS based on an improved certificateless aggregate signature. The proposed scheme can authenticate all sensing bio-information at once in a privacy preserving way. The individual data generated by different users can be verified in batch, while the actual identity of participants is hidden.

The concept of resourcefulness highlights the ability of humans to repurpose objects spontaneously for a different use case than was initially intended. It is a crucial element for human health and wellbeing, which is of great interest for various aspects of HCI and design research. Traditionally, resourcefulness is captured through ethnographic practice. Ethnography can only provide sparse and often short duration observations of human experience, often relying on participants being aware of and remembering behaviours or thoughts they need to report on. Our hypothesis is that resourcefulness can also be captured through continuously monitoring objects being used in everyday life. We developed a system that can record object movement continuously and deployed them in homes of three elderly people for over two weeks. We explored the use of probabilistic topic models to analyze the collected data and identify common patterns.",

Users nowadays want to control all these \"smart\" wireless home devices through their smartphones using an internet connection. Attacks such as distributed attacks on these devices will render the whole system vulnerable as these attacks can record and extract confidential information as well as increase resource (energy) consumption of the entire network. In this paper, we propose a cyber-attack detection algorithm and present an impact analysis of easy-to-launch cyber-attacks on a low-power mote (Z1 Zolertia) as a model IoT device. We also present detailed results of power consumption analysis with and without attack along with when the mitigation algorithm for intrusion detection is implemented.",

    "abstract": "The problem of providing massive connectivity in Internet-of-Things (IoT) with a limited number of available resources motivates the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) solutions. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the signature-based NOMA (S-NOMA) schemes as potential candidates for IoT. The signature in S-NOMA represents the way the data stream of an active device is spread over available resources in a non-orthogonal manner. It can be designed based on device-specific codebook structures, delay patterns, spreading sequences, interleaving patterns, and scrambling sequences. Additionally, we present the detection algorithms employed to decode each device's data from non-orthogonally superimposed signals at the receiver. The bit error rate of different S-NOMA schemes is simulated in impulsive noise environments, which can be important in machine-type communications. Simulation results show that the performance of the S-NOMA schemes degrades under such conditions. Finally, research challenges in S-NOMA oriented IoT are presented.",

To demonstrate how serious this issue is, we introduce in this paper a Privacy Mining Approach (PMA) to mine privacy from smart homes by conducting a series of deductions and analyses on sensor datasets generated by smart homes.

Security and privacy are particularly open challenges for IoT applications due to the widespread use of commodity devices. This work introduces two hardware-based lightweight security mechanisms to ensure sensed data trustworthiness (i.e., sensed data protection and sensor node protection) and usage privacy of the sensors (i.e., privacy-aware reporting of the sensed data) for centralized and decentralized IoT applications. Physically unclonable functions (PUF) form the basis of both proposed mechanisms. To demonstrate the feasibility of our PUF-based approach, we have implemented and evaluated PUFs on three platforms (Atmel 8-bit MCU, ARM Cortex M4 32 bit MCU, and Zynq7010 SoC) with varying complexities. We have also implemented our trusted sensing and privacy-aware reporting scheme (for centralized applications) and secure node scheme (for decentralized applications) on a visual sensor node comprising an OV5642 image sensor and a Zynq7010 SoC. Our experimental evaluation shows a low overhead wrt.~latency, storage, hardware, and communication incurred by our security mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In the Internet of Things (IoT) community, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a key technique to enable ubiquitous sensing of environments and provide reliable services to applications. WSN programs, typically interrupt-driven, implement the functionalities via the collaboration of Interrupt Procedure Instances (IPIs, namely executions of interrupt processing logic). However, due to the complicated concurrency model of WSN programs, the IPIs are interleaved intricately and the program behaviours are hard to predicate from the source codes. Thus, to improve the software quality of WSN programs, it is significant to disentangle the interleaved executions and develop various IPI-based program analysis techniques, including offline and online ones. As the common foundation of those techniques, a generic efficient and real-time algorithm to identify IPIs is urgently desired. However, the existing instance-identification approach cannot satisfy the desires. In this paper, we first formally define the concept of IPI. Next, we propose a generic IPI-identification algorithm, and prove its correctness, real-time and efficiency. We also conduct comparison experiments to illustrate that our algorithm is more efficient than the existing one in terms of both time and space. As the theoretical analyses and empirical studies exhibit, our algorithm provides the groundwork for IPI-based analyses of WSN programs in IoT environment.",

In this paper, we present an efficient and secure data acquisition scheme based on CP-ABE (Ciphertext Policy Attribute Based Encryption). Data acquired from the terminals will be partitioned into blocks and encrypted with its corresponding access sub-tree in sequence, thereby the data encryption and data transmission can be processed in parallel. Furthermore, we protect the information about the access tree with threshold secret sharing method, which can preserve the data privacy and integrity from users with the unauthorized sets of attributes. The formal analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme can fulfill the security requirements of the Cloud-supported IoT in smart grid.

In this system, an application running on mobile devices collected data from the sensors, learned about the user-defined context, made predictions in real-time and manage IoT devices accordingly. However, the computational power of the mobile devices makes it challenging to run machine learning algorithms with acceptable accuracy. To solve this issue, some authors have run machine learning algorithms on the server and transmitted the results to the mobile devices. Although the context-aware predictions made by the server are more accurate than their mobile counterpart, it heavily depends on the network connection for the delivery of the results to the devices, which negatively affects real-time context-learning. Therefore, in this work, we describe a context-learning algorithm for mobile devices which is less demanding on the computational resources and maintains the accuracy of the prediction by updating itself from the learning parameters obtained from the server periodically. Experimental results show that the proposed light-weight context-learning algorithm can achieve mean accuracy up to 97.51% while mean execution time requires only 11ms.",

As the complexity, pervasiveness, and automation of technology systems increases and cyberspace matures, particularly with the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a strong argument that we will need new approaches to assess risk and build trust. The challenge with simply extending existing assessment methodologies to IoT systems is that we could be blind to new risks arising in such ecosystems. These risks could be related to the high degrees of connectivity present or the coupling of digital, cyber-physical, and social systems. This article makes the case for new methodologies to assess risk in this context that consider the dynamics and uniqueness of the IoT while maintaining the rigor of best practice in risk assessment.",

When many smart objects are deployed, selecting the most appropriate set of smart objects to compose a service by considering both energy and quality of service (QoS) is an essential and challenging task. In this paper, we reduced the problem of finding an optimal balance between QoS level and the consumed energy of the IoT service composition to a bi-objective shortest path optimization (BSPO) problem and used an exact algorithm named pulse to solve the problem. The BSPO has two objectives, minimizing the QoS including execution time, network latency, and service price, and minimize the energy consumption of the composite service. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach has short execution time in various complex service profiles. Meanwhile, it can obtain good performance in energy consumption and thus network lifetime while maintaining a reasonable QoS level.",

As a result, fast inference using CNNs trained on such datasets is prohibitive for most resource-constrained IoT platforms. To bridge this gap, we present a principled and practical methodology for distilling a complex modern CNN that is trained to effectively recognize many different classes of input data into an application-dependent essential core that not only recognizes the few classes of interest to the application accurately, but also runs efficiently on platforms with limited resources.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the implications of the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) on the design of an IoT healthcare system. On 25th May 2018, the GDPR has become mandatory within the European Union and hence also for all suppliers of IT products. Infringements on the regulation are now fined with penalties of up 20 Million EUR or 4\\% of the annual turnover of a company whichever is higher. This is a clear motivation for system designers to guarantee compliance to the GDPR. We propose a data labeling model to support access control for privacy-critical patient data together with the Fusion/UML process to design GDPR compliant system. We illustrate this design process on the case study of IoT based monitoring of Alzheimer's patients that we work on in the CHIST-ERA project SUCCESS.",

    "abstract": "Wide scale interest and adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is fuelling innovation in the way individuals and even machines can interact to exchange knowledge. One area of particular interest is that of analytics. Ever decreasing form factor hardware is enabling computation and data storage to be embedded into many different devices. The combination of network connectivity and emerging distributed models of service orchestration is allowing the creation of new ways of measuring, monitoring and analysing performance. Using an approach inspired by the NIST seven layer model of cloud computing, we propose a model of connectivity that enables analytics services to be consumed across individual system components that are distributed, such as those found in the IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT) domains.",

    "abstract": "The established view on massive IoT access is that the IoT devices are activated randomly and independently. This is a basic premise also in the recent information-theoretic treatment of massive access by Polyanskiy. In a number of practical scenarios, the information from IoT devices in a given geographical area is inherently correlated due to a commonly observed physical phenomenon. We introduce a model for massive access that accounts for correlation both in device activation and in the message content. To this end, we introduce common alarm messages for all devices. A physical phenomenon can trigger an alarm causing a subset of devices to transmit the same message at the same time. We develop a new error probability model that includes false positive errors, resulting from decoding a non-transmitted codeword. The results show that the correlation allows for high reliability at the expense of spectral efficiency. This reflects the intuitive trade-off: an access from a massive number can be ultra-reliable only if the information across the devices is correlated.",

To the best of our knowledge, there is no mature TSDB benchmark either. With the goal of establishing a standard of evaluating TSDB systems, we present the IoTDB-Benchmark framework, specifically designed for TSDB and IoT application scenarios. We pay close attention to some special data ingestion scenarios and summarize 10 basic queries types. We use this benchmark to compare four TSDB systems: InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, KairosDB and TimescaleDB. Our benchmark framework/tool not only measures performance metrics but also takes system resource consumption into consideration.",

The visual devices generally have constrained resources in respects to their low computation power, small memory with limited power supply. Therefore, to facilitate the video security in smart environment, lightweight security schemes are required instead of inefficient existing traditional cryptography algorithms. This research paper provides the solution to overcome such problems. A novel lightweight cipher algorithm is proposed here which targets multimedia in IoT with an in-house name EXPer i.e. Extended permutation with eXclusive OR (XOR). EXPer is a symmetric stream cipher that consists of simple XOR and left shift operations with three keys of 128 bits. The proposed cipher algorithm has been tested on various sample videos. Comparison of proposed algorithm has been made with the traditional cipher algorithms XOR and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Visual results confirm that EXPer provides security level equivalent to the AES algorithm with less computational cost than AES. Therefore, it can easily be perceived that the EXPer is a better replacement of AES for securing real-time video applications in IoT.",

Since replacement or recharging of batteries in sensor nodes is almost impossible, power consumption becomes one of the crucial design issues in WSN. Clustering algorithm plays an important role in power conservation for the energy constrained network. Choosing a cluster head can appropriately balance the load in the network thereby reducing energy consumption and enhancing lifetime. The paper focuses on an efficient cluster head election scheme that rotates the cluster head position among the nodes with higher energy level as compared to other. The algorithm considers initial energy, residual energy and an optimum value of cluster heads to elect the next group of cluster heads for the network that suits for IoT applications such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, and systems. Simulation analysis shows the modified version performs better than the LEACH protocol by enhancing the throughput by 60%, lifetime by 66%, and residual energy by 64%.",

With the widespread applications of IoT technology, people's lives have changed dramatically. Due to its capabilities of sensitive data-aware, information collection, communication and processing, it raises security and privacy concerns. Moreover, a malicious attacker may impersonate a legitimate user, which may cause security threat and violation privacy. In allusion to the above problems, we propose a novel and lightweight anonymous authentication and key agreement scheme for heterogeneous IoT, which is innovatively designed to shift between the public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificateless cryptography (CLC) environment. The proposed scheme not only achieves secure communication among the legal authorized users, but also possesses more attributes with user anonymity, non-repudiation and key agreement fairness. Through the security analysis, it is proved that the proposed scheme can resist replay attacks and denial of service (DOS) attacks. Finally, the performance evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is more lightweight and innovative.",

Especially in the context of smart factories the connection of the different, heterogeneous production modules through a digital shop floor promises faster conversion rates, data-driven maintenance or automated machine configurations for use cases, which have not been known at design time. Nevertheless, these scenarios demand IoT representations of all participating machines and components, which requires high installation efforts and hardware adjustments. We propose an incremental process for bringing the shop floor closer to the IoT vision. Currently the majority of systems, components or parts are not yet connected with the internet and might not even provide the possibility to be technically equipped with sensors. However, those could be essential parts for a realistic digital shop floor representation. We, therefore, propose Virtual Representations, which are capable of independently calculating a physical object's condition by dynamically collecting and interpreting already available data through RESTful Web APIs. The internal logic of such Virtual Representations are further adjustable at runtime, since changes to its respective physical object, its environment or updates to the resource itself should not cause any downtime.",

We formulate the resource allocation in the considered model as a multi-objective optimization problem where in addition to the resource allocation variables, the price values are also optimization variables. To solve the proposed multi-objective optimization problem, we use the scalarization method which gives different Pareto optimal solutions. We solve the resulting problems using the alternating approach based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method which converges to a local solution with few iterations. We also consider a conventional approach where each entity tries to maximize its own revenue independently. Simulation results indicate that by applying the proposed joint framework, we can increase the total revenue compared to the conventional case while providing an almost complete fairness among the players. This is while the conventional approach fails to provide such a fairness.",

Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of a channel estimation mean squared error, a bit error rate, a preamble collision probability, and a success probability of short-packet transmissions. The results show that the proposed scheme can support reliable and low-latency featured short-packet transmissions during the RA procedure by efficiently incorporating both multiple antenna and detection techniques.",

Traditional efforts to secure these devices against impersonation attacks mainly rely on either dedicated sensors or specified user motions, impeding their wide-scale adoption. This paper transcends these limitations with a general security solution by leveraging ubiquitous wireless chips available in IoT devices. Particularly, representative time and frequency features are first extracted from received signal strengths (RSSs) to characterize radio propagation profiles. Then, an adversarial multi-player network is developed to recognize underlying radio propagation patterns and facilitate on-body device authentication. We prove that at equilibrium, our adversarial model can extract all information about propagation patterns and eliminate any irrelevant information caused by motion variances. We build a prototype of our system using universal software radio peripheral (USRP) devices and conduct extensive experiments with both static and dynamic body motions in typical indoor and outdoor environments. The experimental results show that our system achieves an average authentication accuracy of 90.4%, with a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.958 and better generalization performance in comparison with the conventional non-adversarial-based approach.",

The edge servers split out a large sum of redundant data and transmit extracted information to the center cloud for further analysis. However, for consideration of limited edge computation ability, part of the raw data in huge data sources may be directly transmitted to the cloud. To manage limited resources online, we propose an algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization to jointly optimize the policy of edge processor frequency, transmission power and bandwidth allocation.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has caused a revolutionary paradigm shift in computer networking. After decades of human-centered routines, where devices were merely tools that enabled human beings to authenticate themselves and perform activities, we are now dealing with a device-centered paradigm: the devices themselves are actors, not just tools for people. Conventional identity access management (IAM) frameworks were not designed to handle the challenges of IoT. Trying to use traditional IAM systems to reconcile heterogeneous devices and complex federations of online services (e.g., IoT sensors and cloud computing solutions) adds a cumbersome architectural layer that can become hard to maintain and act as a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose UniquID, a blockchain-based solution that overcomes the need for centralized IAM architectures while providing scalability and robustness. We also present the experimental results of a proof-of-concept UniquID enrolment network, and we discuss two different use-cases that show the considerable value of a blockchain-based IAM.",

Different from traditional Honeypot requiring dedicated hardware setup, the in-network Honeypot directly reroutes traffic from suspicious nodes and intelligently spoofs the network traffic to them by adding misleading information into normal traffic. Preliminary evaluations on real networks demonstrate that the in-network Honeypot can have little impacts on the performance of IoT networks.",

In order to provide related behavioural models, simulation and tracking approaches have been considered in the literature. In both cases ground truth is essential to train deep models and provide a meaningful quantitative evaluation. We propose a framework for crowd simulation and automatic data generation and annotation that supports multiple cameras and multiple targets. The proposed approach is based on synthetically generated human agents, augmented frames and compositing techniques combined with path finding and planning methods. A number of popular crowd and pedestrian data sets were used to validate the model, and scenarios related to annotation and simulation were considered.",

Since its introduction in 1999, it has slowly increased in use cases and gained a huge spike in popularity since it was used in the popular messaging application Facebook Messenger. In our previous works, we focused on adding geolocation to MQTT, to help modernize the protocol into the IoT age. In this paper, we build off our previous work on MQTTg and build an IoT Android Application that can pull geolocation information from the Operating System. We then use the geolocation data to create geofences to help further tailor the use cases of MQTTg.",

We propose a layered architecture for improving the end-to-end trust that can be applied to a diverse range of blockchain-based IoT applications. Our architecture evaluates the trustworthiness of sensor observations at the data layer and adapts block verification at the blockchain layer through the proposed data trust and gateway reputation modules. We present the performance evaluation of the data trust module using a simulated indoor target localization and the gateway reputation module using an end-to-end blockchain implementation, together with a qualitative security analysis for the architecture.",

    "abstract": "Fog computing can support IoT services with fast response time and low bandwidth usage by moving computation from the cloud to edge devices. However, existing fog computing frameworks have limited flexibility to support dynamic service composition with a data-oriented approach. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a promising programming model for fog computing to enhance flexibility, but the current event- or topic-based design of function triggering and the separation of data management and function execution result in inefficiency for data-intensive IoT services. To achieve both flexibility and efficiency, we propose a data-centric programming model called Fog Function and also introduce its underlying orchestration mechanism that leverages three types of contexts: data context, system context, and usage context. Moreover, we showcase a concrete use case for smart parking where Fog Function allows service developers to easily model their service logic with reduced learning efforts compared to a static service topology. Our performance evaluation results show that the Fog Function can be scaled to hundreds of fog nodes. Fog Function can improve system efficiency by saving 95% of the internal data traffic over cloud function and it can reduce service latency by 30% over edge function.",

We have realized the urgent need of using simple and efficient secure protocol in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) to be practical in the fast mobility of the network nodes, and taking advantage of the existence of base stations gateways along the road to inherit the protocol to different VANETs, this will reduce the initialization of communication overhead time and the security keys initialization each time a node passes to new base station zone. In this research, we applied security protocol used in sensor networks to achieve security in VANET, the simulation analysis shows that secure practical communication is achieved which can be inherited to other sub VANETs. The contribution of this article is enhancing proposed protocols with as less cryptography computation overhead as possible to make it applicable in the high mobility nature of VANET using security primitives; which guarantees security while allowing fast authenticating during vehicle passing one VANET to the next one depending on its direction in the transportation networks.",

We utilize the concepts of ternary states to exclude the cells which are easily prone to flip, allowing us to extract stable bits from the fingerprint of the SRAM. Using the custom-made software for our SRAM device, we can control the error rate of the PUF to achieve an adjustable memory-based PUF for key generation. We utilize several fuzzy extractor techniques based on using different error correction coding methods to generate secret keys from the SRAM PUF, and study the trade-off between the false authentication rate and false rejection rate of the PUF.",

Among all available LPWAN technologies, LoRa networking has attracted much attention from both academia and industry, since it specifies an open standard and allows us to build autonomous LPWAN networks without any third-party infrastructure. Many LoRa networks have been developed recently, e.g., managing solar plants in Carson City, Nevada, USA and power monitoring in Lyon and Grenoble, France.

In this paper, a Knowledge Graph (KG) centric framework is proposed to develop CT. Based on the framework, a future tool-chain is proposed to develop the CT for the initiatives of H2020 project FACTLOG. Based on the comparison between DT and CT, we infer the CT is a more comprehensive approach to support IoT-based systems development than DT.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, as intrusion attacks on IoT networks have grown exponentially, there is an immediate need for sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDSs). A vast majority of current IDSs are data-driven, which means that one of the most important aspects of this area of research is the quality of the data acquired from IoT network traffic. Two of the most cited intrusion detection datasets are the KDDCup99 and the NSL-KDD. The main goal of our project was to conduct a robust comparison of both datasets by evaluating the performance of various Machine Learning (ML) classifiers trained on them with a larger set of classification metrics than previous researchers. From our research, we were able to conclude that the NSL-KDD dataset is of a higher quality than the KDDCup99 dataset as the classifiers trained on it were on average 20.18% less accurate. This is because the classifiers trained on the KDDCup99 dataset exhibited a bias towards the redundancies within it, allowing them to achieve higher accuracies.",

    "abstract": "In the Internet of Things, the relevance of data often depends on the geographic context of data producers and consumers. Today's data distribution services, however, mostly focus on data content and not on geo-context, which could help to reduce the dissemination of excess data in many IoT scenarios. In this paper, we propose to use the geo-context information associated with devices to control data distribution. We define what geo-context dimensions exist and compare our definition with concepts from related work. Furthermore, we designed GeoBroker, a data distribution service that uses the location of things, as well as geofences for messages and subscriptions, to control data distribution. This way, we enable new IoT application scenarios while also increasing overall system efficiency for scenarios where geo-contexts matter by delivering only relevant messages. We evaluate our approach based on a proof-of-concept prototype and several experiments.",

The results showed that for a capacitated problem, service splitting introduces power consumption savings of up to 86% compared to 46% with non-splittable services in relation to processing in general-purpose data centers (GP-DCs). Moreover, it is observed that the inter sub-service processing overhead has a great influence on the total number of service splits. However much insignificant the ratio of the processing overhead, the results showed that this is not a trivial matter and hence much attention needs to paid to this area in order to make the best use of the resources that are available in the edge of the network.

At the same time, an RSS-based technique is used to estimate the location of the visitor in the museum. An Android application is developed to estimate the distance from the exhibits and collect useful analytics regarding each visit and provide a recommendation to the users. Moreover, the application implements a simple Kalman filter in the smartphone, without the need of the Cloud, to improve localization precision and accuracy. Experimental results on distance estimation, location, and detection accuracy show that BLE beacon is a promising solution for an interactive smart museum.

Protocols such as CoAP or MQTT-SN are degraded by the overhead of DTLS sessions, which in common deployment protect content transfer only up to the gateway. To preserve content security end-to-end via gateways and proxies, the IETF recently developed Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), which extends CoAP with content object security features commonly known from Information Centric Networks (ICN). This paper presents a comparative analysis of protocol stacks that protect request-response transactions. We measure protocol performances of CoAP over DTLS, OSCORE, and the information-centric Named Data Networking (NDN) protocol on a large-scale IoT testbed in single- and multi-hop scenarios. Our findings indicate that (a) OSCORE improves on CoAP over DTLS in error-prone wireless regimes due to omitting the overhead of maintaining security sessions at endpoints, and (b) NDN attains superior robustness and reliability due to its intrinsic network caches and hop-wise retransmissions.",

Particularly, the UAV flies towards the sensors to collect status update packets within a given duration while maintaining a non-negative residual energy. We formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to find the optimal flight trajectory of the UAV and transmission scheduling of the sensors that minimizes the weighted sum of the age of information (AoI). A UAV-assisted data collection algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is further proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality.

Hence, an ultra low-power consumption of 9.015 {\\mu}W for a single measurement is achieved. Measurements based on a proof-of-concept hardware platform show median distance error values below 10 cm. Both simulations and measurements demonstrate that the accuracy is reduced at low signal-to-noise ratios and when reflections occur. We introduce three methods that enhance the distance measurements at a low extra processing power cost. Hence, we validate in realistic environments that the centimeter accuracy can be obtained within the energy budget of mobile devices and IoT nodes.

In fact, grant-free access has been identified as a key medium access control technique for providing massive connectivity in machine type communications in cellular networks. In this paper, we show that grant-free access combined with non-orthogonal transmission schemes is a promising solution for 6G Internet of Things (IoT).

In this paper, we investigate computation offloading mechanism with resource allocation in IoT edge computing networks by formulating it as a stochastic game. Here, each end user is a learning agent observing its local environment to learn optimal decisions on either local computing or edge computing with the goal of minimizing long term system cost by choosing its transmit power level, RAT and sub-channel without knowing any information of the other end users. Therefore, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework is developed to solve the stochastic game with a proposed independent learners based multi-agent Q-learning (IL-based MA-Q) algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed IL-based MA-Q algorithm is feasible to solve the formulated problem and is more energy efficient without extra cost on channel estimation at the centralized gateway compared to the other two benchmark algorithms.",

The novelty of LiTiChain lies in ensuring the connectivity of the chain even after the expired blocks are deleted from the chain. To provide the same level of security as conventional blockchain, in LiTiChain, some blocks are stored longer than their lifetime, which incurs additional storage cost. This paper presents two new blockchain architectures i.e. p-LiTiChain and s-LiTiChain that are variants of LiTiChain. The proposed architectures offer a degree of freedom in the design of blockchain of finite-lifetime blocks in terms of a tradeoff between storage cost, security and computational cost.

    "abstract": "With ever-expanding computation and communication capabilities of modern embedded platforms, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enable development of Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems---a new generation of highly modularized industrial equipment suitable for highly-customized manufacturing. Sequential control in these systems is largely based on discrete events, while their formal execution semantics is specified as Control Interpreted Petri Nets (CIPN). Despite industry-wide use of programming languages based on the CIPN formalism, formal verification of such control applications in the presence of adversarial activity is not supported. Consequently, in this paper we focus on security-aware modeling and verification challenges for CIPN-based sequential control applications. Specifically, we show how CIPN models of networked industrial IoT controllers can be transformed into Time Petri Net (TPN)-based models, and composed with plant and security-aware channel models in order to enable system-level verification of safety properties in the presence of network-based attacks. Additionally, we introduce realistic channel-specific attack models that capture adversarial behavior using nondeterminism. Moreover, we show how verification results can be utilized to introduce security patches and motivate design of attack detectors that improve overall system resiliency, and allow satisfaction of critical safety properties. Finally, we evaluate our framework on an industrial case study.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a novel spatiotemporal model for large-scale IoT networks with asynchronous periodic traffic and hard-packet deadlines. A static marked Poisson bipolar point process is utilized to model the spatial locations of the IoT devices, where the marks mimic the relative time-offsets of traffic duty cycles at different devices. At each device, an absorbing Markov chain is utilized to capture the temporal evolution of packets from generation until either successful delivery or deadline expiry. The temporal evolution of packets is defined in terms of the Aloha transmission/backoff states. From the network perspective, the meta distribution of the transmission success probability is used to characterize the mutual interference among of the coexisting devices. To this end, the network performance is characterized in terms of the probabilities of meeting/missing the delivery deadlines and transmission latency. The results unveil counter-intuitive superior performance of strict packet deadlines in terms of transmission success and latency.",

    "abstract": "We consider Internet of Things (IoT) organized on the principles of cell-free massive MIMO. Since the number of things is very large, orthogonal pilots cannot be assigned to all of them even if the things are stationary. This results in an unavoidable pilot contamination problem, worsened by the fact that, for IoT, since the things are operating at very low transmit power. To mitigate this problem and achieve a high throughput, we use cell-free systems with optimal linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation, while traditionally simple suboptimal estimators have been used in such systems. We further derive the analytical uplink and downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expressions for this scenario, which depends only on large scale fading coefficients. This allows us to design new power control algorithms that require only infrequent transmit power adaptation. Simulation results show a 40% improvement in uplink and downlink throughputs and 95% in energy efficiency over existing cell-free wireless systems and at least a three-fold uplink improvement over known IoT systems based on small-cell systems.",

Recent experiences with COVID-19 show that by using a smart and swift approach to deal with pandemics, avoids overwhelming of healthcare systems, and reduces the loss of precious life. This paper is about using smart technologies such as Mobile Edge Clouds (MEC), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), as an approach to effectively manage pandemics. IoT provides pervasive connectivity among various devices and can be used for collecting information such as location and symptoms of potentially infected individuals. MECs provide cloud services on the edge, integrating IoT infrastructure and execution of sophisticated AI algorithms in the Cloud. In this paper, we develop a prototype to demonstrate the convergence of pervasive technologies to support research in managing pandemics. Low-cost Single Board Computers (SBC) based clusters are integrated within MEC to support remote medical teams in the field. The prototype implements a lightweight Docker container orchestrated by Kubernetes eco-system which is deployed on the clusters. The prototype successfully demonstrates that mobile medical facilities can utilize the proposed solution to collect information and execute AI algorithms while on the go. Finally, we present a discussion on the role of converging pervasive technologies on managing pandemics.",

So far, intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the effective security tools, but the vast amount of data that is generated by heterogeneous protocols and \"things\" alongside the constrained resources of the hosts, make some of the present IDS schemes defeated. To grant IDSs the ability of working in the IoT environments, in this paper, we propose a new distributed dimension reduction scheme which addresses the limited resources challenge. A novel autoencoder (AE) designed, and it learns to generate a latent space. Then, the constrained hosts/probes use the generated weights to lower the dimension with a single operation. The compressed data is transferred to a central IDS server to verify the traffic type. This scheme aims to lower the needed bandwidth to transfer data by compressing it and also reduce the overhead of the compression task in the hosts. The proposed scheme is evaluated on three well-known network traffic datasets (UNSW-NB15, TON\\_IoT20 and NSL-KDD), and the results show that we can have a 3-dimensional latent space (about 90\\% compression) without any remarkable fall in IDS detection accuracy.",

The framework is dynamic and modules can be added and omitted by a centralized controlling unit without disturbing the other components of the framework and other modules may be updated accordingly. In the proposed addressing scheme, a new Internet of Things (IoT) device will receive an IP address from one of their existing neighboring peer devices. This allows devices in the city to act as a proxy and generate a set of unique IP addresses from their own IP addresses, which can then be assigned to new (joining) devices; hence, reducing addressing overhead and latency, as well as avoiding the need to send broadcast messages during the address allocation process. Thus, it achieves considerable bandwidth and energy savings for the IoT devices.",

Under the assumption of Bernoulli information packet arrivals and a common geometric service time distribution across all the sources, we numerically obtain the exact per-source distributions of AoI and PAoI in matrix-geometric form for three different queueing disciplines: i) Non-Preemptive Bufferless (NPB) ii) Preemptive Bufferless (PB) iii) Non-Preemptive Single Buffer with Replacement (NPSBR). The proposed numerical algorithm employs the theory of Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC) of Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) type and is matrix analytical, i.e, the algorithm is based on numerically stable and efficient vector-matrix operations.Numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed queueing model. We also present a numerical example on the optimum choice of the Bernoulli parameters in a practical IoT system with two sources with diverse AoI requirements.",

    "abstract": "Recent study has shown that compressive sensing (CS) based computationally secure scheme using Gaussian or Binomial sensing matrix in resource-constrained IoT devices is vulnerable to ciphertext-only attack. Although the CS-based perfectly secure scheme has no such vulnerabilities, the practical realization of the perfectly secure scheme is challenging, because it requires an additional secure channel to transmit the measurement norm. In this paper, we devise a practical realization of a perfectly secure scheme by concealing energy in which the requirement of an additional secure channel is removed. Since the generation of Gaussian sensing matrices is not feasible in resource-constrained IoT devices, approximate Gaussian sensing matrices are generated using linear feedback shift registers. We also demonstrate the implementation feasibility of the proposed perfectly secure scheme in practice without additional complexity. Furthermore, the security analysis of the proposed scheme is performed and compared with the state-of-the-art compressive sensing based energy obfuscation scheme.",

The proposed scheme achieves two-class secrecy, one for superuser who can retrieve the exact sensor data, and the other for semi-authorized user who is only able to obtain the statistical data such as mean, variance, etc. MPCC scheme allows computationally expensive sparse signal recovery to be performed at cloud without compromising the confidentiality of data to the cloud service providers. In this way, it mitigates the issues in data transmission, energy and storage caused by massive IoT sensor data as well as the increasing concerns about IoT data privacy in cloud computing. Compared with the state-of-the-art schemes, we show that MPCC scheme not only has lower computational complexity at the IoT sensor device and data consumer, but also is proved to be secure against ciphertext-only attack.",

    "abstract": "In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, there are plenty of informative data provided by a massive number of IoT devices (e.g., sensors). Learning a function from such data is of great interest in machine learning tasks for IoT systems. Focusing on streaming (or sequential) data, we present a privacy-preserving distributed online learning framework with multiplekernels (named DOMKL). The proposed DOMKL is devised by leveraging the principles of an online alternating direction of multipliers (OADMM) and a distributed Hedge algorithm. We theoretically prove that DOMKL over T time slots can achieve an optimal sublinear regret, implying that every learned function achieves the performance of the best function in hindsight as in the state-of-the-art centralized online learning method. Moreover, it is ensured that the learned functions of any two neighboring learners have a negligible difference as T grows, i.e., the so-called consensus constraints hold. Via experimental tests with various real datasets, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed DOMKL on regression and time-series prediction tasks.",

Compression is commonly used to reduce web traffic, to save energy, and to make network transfers faster. If not used judiciously, however, compression can hurt performance. This work proposes and evaluates mechanisms that employ selective compression at the network's edge, based on data characteristics and network conditions. This approach (i) improves the performance of network transfers in IoT environments, while (ii) providing significant data savings. We demonstrate that our library speeds up web transfers by an average of 2.18x and 2.03x under fixed and dynamically changing network conditions respectively.

    "abstract": "A recent McKinsey report estimates the economic impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) to be between $3.9 to $11 trillion dollars by 20251 . IoT has the potential to have a profound impact on our daily lives, including technologies for the home, for health, for transportation, and for managing our natural resources. The Internet was largely driven by information and ideas generated by people, but advances in sensing and hardware have enabled computers to more easily observe the physical world. Coupling this additional layer of information with advances in machine learning brings dramatic new capabilities including the ability to capture and process tremendous amounts of data; to predict behaviors, activities, and the future in uncanny ways; and to manipulate the physical world in response. This trend will fundamentally change how people interact with physical objects and the environment. Success in developing value-added capabilities around IoT requires a broad approach that includes expertise in sensing and hardware, machine learning, networked systems, human-computer interaction, security, and privacy. Strategies for making IoT practical and spurring its ultimate adoption also require a multifaceted approach that often transcends technology, such as with concerns over data security, privacy, public policy, and regulatory issues. In this paper we argue that existing best practices in building robust and secure systems are insufficient to address the new challenges that IoT systems will present. We provide recommendations regarding investments in research areas that will help address inadequacies in existing systems, practices, tools, and policies.",

Article 25 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016 puts this on a strict legal basis by establishing the need for information privacy by design and default (PbD) for personal data-driven technologies. Against this backdrop, we examine legal, commercial and technical perspectives around the newly created legal right to data portability (RTDP) in GDPR. We are motivated by a pressing need to address regulatory challenges stemming from the Internet of Things (IoT). We need to find channels to support the protection of these new legal rights for users in practice. In Part I we introduce the internet of things and information PbD in more detail. We briefly consider regulatory challenges posed by the IoT and the nature and practical challenges surrounding the regulatory response of information privacy by design. In Part II, we look in depth at the legal nature of the RTDP, determining what it requires from IT designers in practice but also limitations on the right and how it relates to IoT. In Part III we focus on technical approaches that can support the realisation of the right. We consider the state of the art in data management architectures, tools and platforms that can provide portability, increased transparency and user control over the data flows. In Part IV, we bring our perspectives together to reflect on the technical, legal and business barriers and opportunities that will shape the implementation of the RTDP in practice, and how the relationships may shape emerging IoT innovation and business models. We finish with brief conclusions about the future for the RTDP and PbD in the IoT.",

    "abstract": "We continue to see increasingly widespread deployment of IoT devices, with apparent intent to embed them in our built environment likely to accelerate if smart city and related programmes succeed. In this paper we are concerned with the ways in which current generation IoT devices are being designed in terms of their ill-considered dependencies on network connectivity and services. Our hope is to provide evidence that such dependencies need to be better thought through in design, and better documented in implementation so that those responsible for deploying these devices can be properly informed as to the impact of device deployment (at scale) on infrastructure resilience. We believe this will be particularly relevant as we feel that commodity IoT devices are likely to be commonly used to retrofit `smart' capabilities to existing buildings, particularly domestic buildings. To the existing body of work on network-level behaviour of IoT devices, we add \\one~a protocol-level breakdown and analysis of periodicity, \\two~an exploration of the service and infrastructure dependencies that will implicitly be taken in `smart' environments when IoT devices are deployed, and \\three~examination of the robustness of device operation when connectivity is disrupted. We find that many devices make use of services distributed across the planet and thus appear dependent on the global network infrastructure even when carrying out purely local actions. Some devices cease to operate properly without network connectivity (even where their behaviour appears, on the face of it, to require only local information, e.g.,~the Hive thermostat). Further, they exhibit quite different network behaviours, typically involving significantly more traffic and possibly use of otherwise unobserved protocols, when connectivity is recovered after some disruption.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a new framework called blockchain-based Radio Frequency (RF)-powered backscatter cognitive radio network. In the framework, IoT devices as secondary transmitters transmit their sensing data to a secondary gateway by using the RF-powered backscatter cognitive radio technology. The data collected at the gateway is then sent to a blockchain network for further verification, storage and processing. As such, the framework enables the IoT system to simultaneously optimize the spectrum usage and maximize the energy efficiency. Moreover, the framework ensures that the data collected from the IoT devices is verified, stored and processed in a decentralized but in a trusted manner. To achieve the goal, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem for the gateway under the dynamics of the primary channel, the uncertainty of the IoT devices, and the unpredictability of the blockchain environment. In the problem, the gateway jointly decides (i) the time scheduling, i.e., the energy harvesting time, backscatter time, and transmission time, among the IoT devices, (ii) the blockchain network, and (iii) the transaction fee rate to maximize the network throughput while minimizing the cost. To solve the stochastic optimization problem, we then propose to employ, evaluate, and assess the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (D3QN) to derive the optimal policy for the gateway. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed solution outperforms the conventional baseline approaches such as the conventional Q-Learning algorithm and non-learning algorithms in terms of network throughput and convergence speed. Furthermore, the proposed solution guarantees that the data is stored in the blockchain network at a reasonable cost.",

    "abstract": "Future IoT networks consist of heterogeneous types of IoT devices (with various communication types and energy constraints) which are assumed to belong to an IoT service provider (ISP). To power backscattering-based and wireless-powered devices, the ISP has to contract with an energy service provider (ESP). This article studies the strategic interactions between the ISP and its ESP and their implications on the joint optimal time scheduling and energy trading for heterogeneous devices. To that end, we propose an economic framework using the Stackelberg game to maximize the network throughput and energy efficiency of both the ISP and ESP. Specifically, the ISP leads the game by sending its optimal service time and energy price request (that maximizes its profit) to the ESP. The ESP then optimizes and supplies the transmission power which satisfies the ISP's request (while maximizing ESP's utility). To obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), we apply a backward induction technique which first derives a closed-form solution for the ESP. Then, to tackle the non-convex optimization problem for the ISP, we leverage the block coordinate descent and convex-concave procedure techniques to design two partitioning schemes (i.e., partial adjustment (PA) and joint adjustment (JA)) to find the optimal energy price and service time that constitute local SEs. Numerical results reveal that by jointly optimizing the energy trading and the time allocation for heterogeneous IoT devices, one can achieve significant improvements in terms of the ISP's profit compared with those of conventional transmission methods. Different tradeoffs between the ESP's and ISP's profits and complexities of the PA/JA schemes can also be numerically tuned. Simulations also show that the obtained local SEs approach the socially optimal welfare when the ISP's benefit per transmitted bit is higher than a given threshold.",

    "abstract": "In the near future, it is envisioned that cellular networks will have to cope with extensive Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Therefore, a required feature of cellular IoT will be the capability to serve simultaneously a large number of devices with heterogeneous demands and qualities of Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). In this paper, we focus on an overloaded Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC) with two groups of CSIT qualities, namely one group of users (representative of high-end devices) for which the transmitter has partial knowledge of the CSI, the other group of users (representative of IoT devices) for which the transmitter only has knowledge of the statistical CSI. We introduce Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), a new multiple access based on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) for cellular IoT. Two strategies are proposed, namely, Time Partitioning-RSMA (TP-RSMA) and Power Partitioning-RSMA (PP-RSMA). The former independently serves the two groups of users over orthogonal time slots while the latter jointly serves the two groups of users within the same time slot in a non-orthogonal manner. We first show at high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) that PP-RSMA achieves the optimum Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) in an overloaded MISO BC with heterogeneous CSIT qualities and then show at finite SNR that, by marrying the benefits of PP and RSMA, PP-RSMA achieves explicit sum rate gain over TP-RSMA and all baseline schemes. Furthermore, PP-RSMA is robust to CSIT inaccuracy and flexible to cope with Quality of Service (QoS) rate constraints of all users. The DoF and rate analysis helps us draw the conclusion that PP-RSMA is a powerful framework for cellular IoT with a large number of devices.",

This is also ideal for real world sensor deployments where connecting sensors directly to a computer or to the Internet is not practical. Most of the leading IoT middleware solutions require manual and labour intensive tasks to be completed in order to connect a mobile phone to them. In this paper we present a mobile application called Mobile Sensor Hub (MoSHub). It allows variety of different sensors to be connected to a mobile phone and send the data to the cloud intelligently reducing network communication. Specifically, we explore techniques that allow MoSHub to be connected to cloud based IoT middleware solutions autonomously. For our experiments, we employed Global Sensor Network (GSN) middleware to implement and evaluate our approach. Such automated configuration reduces significant amount of manual labour that need to be performed by technical experts otherwise. We also evaluated different methods that can be used to automate the configuration process.",

In this paper, we present CASSARAM, a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model for Internet of Things to address the research challenges of selecting sensors when large numbers of sensors with overlapping and sometimes redundant functionality are available. CASSARAM proposes the search and selection of sensors based on user priorities. CASSARAM considers a broad range of characteristics of sensors for search such as reliability, accuracy, battery life just to name a few. Our approach utilises both semantic querying and quantitative reasoning techniques. User priority based weighted Euclidean distance comparison in multidimensional space technique is used to index and rank sensors. Our objectives are to highlight the importance of sensor search in IoT paradigm, identify important characteristics of both sensors and data acquisition processes which help to select sensors, understand how semantic and statistical reasoning can be combined together to address this problem in an efficient manner. We developed a tool called CASSARA to evaluate the proposed model in terms of resource consumption and response time.",

    "abstract": "We develop a new location spoofing detection algorithm for geo-spatial tagging and location-based services in the Internet of Things (IoT), called Enhanced Location Spoofing Detection using Audibility (ELSA) which can be implemented at the backend server without modifying existing legacy IoT systems. ELSA is based on a statistical decision theory framework and uses two-way time-of-arrival (TW-TOA) information between the user's device and the anchors. In addition to the TW-TOA information, ELSA exploits the implicit available audibility information to improve detection rates of location spoofing attacks. Given TW-TOA and audibility information, we derive the decision rule for the verification of the device's location, based on the generalized likelihood ratio test. We develop a practical threat model for delay measurements spoofing scenarios, and investigate in detail the performance of ELSA in terms of detection and false alarm rates. Our extensive simulation results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of ELSA compared to conventional non-audibility-aware approaches.",

    "abstract": "Future Internet-of-Things (IoT) will connect billions of small computing devices embedded in the environment and support their device-to-device (D2D) communication. Powering this massive number of embedded devices is a key challenge of designing IoT since batteries increase the devices' form factors and their recharging/replacement is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel network architecture that integrates wireless power transfer and backscatter communication, called wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WP-BC) networks. In this architecture, power beacons (PBs) are deployed for wirelessly powering devices; their ad-hoc communication relies on backscattering and modulating incident continuous waves from PBs, which consumes orders-of-magnitude less power than traditional radios. Thereby, the dense deployment of low-complexity PBs with high transmission power can power a large-scale IoT. In this paper, a WP-BC network is modeled as a random Poisson cluster process in the horizontal plane where PBs are Poisson distributed and active ad-hoc pairs of backscatter communication nodes with fixed separation distances form random clusters centered at PBs. Furthermore, by harvesting energy from and backscattering radio frequency (RF) waves transmitted by PBs, the transmission power of each node depends on the distance from the associated PB. Applying stochastic geometry, the network coverage probability and transmission capacity are derived and optimized as functions of the backscatter duty cycle and reflection coefficient as well as the PB density. The effects of the parameters on network performance are characterized.",

To address the need for better privacy in both the IoT and the mobile landscape, we develop two protocols for private service discovery and private mutual authentication. Our protocols provide private and authentic service advertisements, zero round-trip (0-RTT) mutual authentication, and are provably secure in the Canetti-Krawczyk key-exchange model. In contrast to alternatives, our protocols are lightweight and require minimal modification to existing key-exchange protocols. We integrate our protocols into an existing open-source distributed applications framework, and provide benchmarks on multiple hardware platforms: Intel Edisons, Raspberry Pis, smartphones, laptops, and desktops. Finally, we discuss some privacy limitations of the Apple AirDrop protocol (a peer-to-peer file sharing mechanism) and show how to improve the privacy of Apple AirDrop using our private mutual authentication protocol.",

However, the existing wireless technologies lack the ability to support a huge amount of data exchange from many battery driven devices spread over a wide area. In order to support the IoT paradigm, the IEEE 802.11 standard committee is in process of introducing a new standard, called IEEE 802.11ah. This is one of the most promising and appealing standards, which aims to bridge the gap between traditional mobile networks and the demands of the IoT. In this paper, we first discuss the main PHY and MAC layer amendments proposed for IEEE 802.11ah. Furthermore, we investigate the operability of IEEE 802.11ah as a backhaul link to connect devices over a long range. Additionally, we compare the aforementioned standard with previous notable IEEE 802.11 amendments (i.e. IEEE 802.11n and IEEE 802.11ac) in terms of throughput (with and without frame aggregation) by utilizing the most robust modulation schemes.

    "abstract": "With the advent of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), handling large volumes of time-series data has become a growing concern. Data, generated from millions of Internet-connected sensors, will drive new IoT applications and services. A key requirement is the ability to aggregate, preprocess, index, store and analyze data with minimal latency so that time-to-insight can be reduced. In the future, we expect real-time data collection and analysis to be performed both on small devices (e.g., in hubs and appliances) as well in server-based infrastructure. The ability to localize sensitive data to the home, and thus preserve privacy, is a key driver for small-device deployment. In this paper, we present an efficient architecture for time-series data management that provides a high data ingestion rate, while still being sufficiently lightweight that it can be deployed in embedded environments or small virtual machines. Our solution strives to minimize overhead and explores what can be done without complex indexing schemes that typically, for performance reasons, must be held in main memory. We combine a simple in-memory hierarchical index, log-structured store and in-flight sort, with a high-performance data pipeline architecture that is optimized for multicore platforms. We show that our solution is able to handle streaming insertions at over 4 million records per second (on a single x86 server) while still retaining SQL query performance better than or comparable to existing RDBMS.",

It relies on a set of low-power fog nodes that are close to the end users to offload the services originally targeting at cloud data centers. In this paper, we consider a specific fog computing network consisting of a set of data service operators (DSOs) each of which controls a set of fog nodes to provide the required data service to a set of data service subscribers (DSSs). How to allocate the limited computing resources of fog nodes (FNs) to all the DSSs to achieve an optimal and stable performance is an important problem. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization framework for all FNs, DSOs and DSSs to achieve the optimal resource allocation schemes in a distributed fashion. In the framework, we first formulate a Stackelberg game to analyze the pricing problem for the DSOs as well as the resource allocation problem for the DSSs. Under the scenarios that the DSOs can know the expected amount of resource purchased by the DSSs, a many-to-many matching game is applied to investigate the pairing problem between DSOs and FNs. Finally, within the same DSO, we apply another layer of many-to-many matching between each of the paired FNs and serving DSSs to solve the FN-DSS pairing problem. Simulation results show that our proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of the IoT-based network systems.",

The disruptive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack last year has hit major Internet companies, causing intermittent service for millions of Internet users. Since the affected devices typically do not support firmware update, it becomes challenging to expel these vulnerable devices in the wild. Both industry and academia have made great efforts in amending the situation. However, none of these efforts is simple to deploy, and at the same time effective in solving the problem. In this work, we design a collaborative defense strategy to tackle Mirai. Our key idea is to take advantage of human involvement in the least aggressive way. In particular, at a negotiated time slot, a customer is required to reboot the compromised device, then a \"white\" Mirai operated by the manufacturer breaks into the clean-state IoT devices immediately. The \"white\" Mirai expels other malicious Mirai variants, blocks vulnerable ports, and keeps a heart-beat connection with the server operated by the manufacturer. Once the heart-beat is lost, the server re-implants the \"white\" Mirai instantly. We have implemented a full prototype of the designed system, and the results show that our system can evade Mirai attacks effectively.",

However, the nascent of the highly decentralized Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that cannot effectively utilize the centralized Cloud infrastructures pushes computing towards resource dispersion. Fog computing extends the Cloud paradigm by enabling dispersion of the computational and storage resources at the edge of the network in a close proximity to where the data is generated. In its essence, Fog computing facilitates the operation of the limited compute, storage and networking resources physically located close to the edge devices. However, the shared complexity of the Fog and the influence of the recent IoT trends moving towards deploying and interconnecting extremely large sets of pervasive devices and sensors, requires exploration of adaptive Fog architectural approaches capable of adapting and scaling in response to the unpredictable load patterns of the distributed IoT applications. In this paper we introduce a promising new nature-inspired Fog architecture, named SmartFog, capable of providing low decision making latency and adaptive resource management. By utilizing novel algorithms and techniques from the fields of multi-criteria decision making, graph theory and machine learning we model the Fog as a distributed intelligent processing system, therefore emulating the function of the human brain.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), there is a growing need for access control and data protection on low-power, pervasive devices. Biometric-based authentication is promising for IoT due to its convenient nature and lower susceptibility to attacks. However, the costs associated with biometric processing and template protection are nontrivial for smart cards, key fobs, and so forth. In this paper, we discuss the security, cost, and utility of biometric systems and develop two major frameworks for improving them. First, we introduce a new framework for implementing biometric systems based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and hardware obfuscation that, unlike traditional software approaches, does not require nonvolatile storage of a biometric template/key. Aside from reducing the risk of compromising the biometric, the nature of obfuscation also provides protection against access control circumvention via malware and fault injection. The PUF provides non-invertibility and non-linkability. Second, a major requirement of the proposed PUF/obfuscation approach is that a reliable (robust) key be generated from the users input biometric. We propose a noiseaware biometric quantization framework capable of generating unique, reliable keys with reduced enrollment time and denoising costs. Finally, we conduct several case studies. In the first, the proposed noise-aware approach is compared to our previous approach for multiple biometric modalities, including popular ones (fingerprint and iris) and emerging cardiovascular ones (ECG and PPG). The results show that ECG provides the best tradeoff between reliability, key length, entropy, and cost. In the second and third case studies, we demonstrate how reliability, denoising costs, and enrollment times can be simultaneously improved by modeling subject intra-variations for ECG.",

Traditional access and usage control mechanisms are only able to determine if data may be used by a subject, but lack an understanding of how it may be used. The ability to control the way how data is processed is however crucial for enterprises to guarantee (and provide evidence of) compliant processing of critical data, as well as for users who need to control if their private data may be analyzed or linked with additional information - a major concern in IoT applications processing personal information. In this paper, we introduce LUCON, a data-centric security policy framework for distributed systems that considers data flows by controlling how messages may be routed across services and how they are combined and processed. LUCON policies prevent information leaks, bind data usage to obligations, and enforce data flows across services. Policy enforcement is based on a dynamic taint analysis at runtime and an upfront static verification of message routes against policies. We discuss the semantics of these two complementing enforcement models and illustrate how LUCON policies are compiled from a simple policy language into a first-order logic representation. We demonstrate the practical application of LUCON in a real-world IoT middleware and discuss its integration into Apache Camel. Finally, we evaluate the runtime impact of LUCON and discuss performance and scalability aspects.",

Each UE has a rechargeable battery with finite capacity. The system control is modeled as a Markov decision process without complete prior knowledge assumed at the BS, which also deals with large sizes in both state and action spaces. First, to handle the access control problem assuming causal battery and channel state information, we propose a scheduling algorithm that maximizes the uplink transmission sum rate based on reinforcement learning (RL) with deep Q-network (DQN) enhancement. Second, for the battery prediction problem, with a fixed round-robin access control policy adopted, we develop a RL based algorithm to minimize the prediction loss (error) without any model knowledge about the energy source and energy arrival process. Finally, the joint access control and battery prediction problem is investigated, where we propose a two-layer RL network to simultaneously deal with maximizing the sum rate and minimizing the prediction loss: the first layer is for battery prediction, the second layer generates the access policy based on the output from the first layer.

To maximize the system throughput and ensure fairness, we aim to maximize the minimum throughput among all BDs by jointly optimizing the backscatter time and reflection coefficients of the BDs, and the FAP's subcarrier power allocation, subject to the LU's throughput constraint, the BDs' harvested-energy constraints, and other practical constraints. For the case with a single BD, we obtain closed-form solutions and propose an efficient algorithm by using the Lagrange duality method. For the general case with multiple BDs, we propose an iterative algorithm by leveraging the block coordinated decent and successive convex optimization techniques. We further show the convergence performances of the proposed algorithms and analyze their complexities. In addition, we study the throughput region which characterizes the Pareto-optimal throughput trade-offs among all BDs.

Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an adherent of IoT that has realized significant advancements using communication technologies. Vehicles connected through Internet are capable of sharing information that can substantially enhance the quality of traffic on roads. Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is an instance of IoT that deals specifically in socialization of connected objects. SIoT enables the notion of Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV) where vehicles are the key entities for sharing information between themselves and the infrastructure (commonly known as Road Side Units (RSUs)). Vehicles in SIoV socialize by exchanging data such as traffic congestions, weather conditions, infotainment, vacant parking slots, alternate routes and discount coupons for restaurants etc. In SIoV, vehicles can communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure through traditional communication technologies like Wi-Fi, Cellular networks or through Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) etc. SIoV will be confronted with ethical dilemmas and expected to function in an ethically responsible manner. This paper highlights the ethical implications of SIoV systems. Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) involves autonomous decision making that requires setting ethical and moral rules before taking verdict. The article discusses the lack of ethical guidelines in designing and deploying of SIoV systems that are of utmost importance.

We consider a use case based on the deployment of smart services in decentralized territories. A two level simulator is employed, which is based on a coarse agent-based, adaptive parallel and distributed simulation approach to model the general life of simulated entities. However, when needed a finer grained simulator (based on OMNeT++) is triggered on a restricted portion of the simulated area, which allows considering all issues concerned with wireless communications. Based on this use case, it is confirmed that the ad-hoc wireless networking technologies do represent a principle tool to deploy smart services over decentralized countrysides.

    "abstract": "Massive co-located devices require new paradigms to allow proper network connectivity. Internet of things (IoT) is the paradigm that offers a solution for the inter-connectivity of devices, but in dense IoT networks time synchronization is a critical aspect. Further, the scalability is another crucial aspect. This paper focuses on synchronization for uncoordinated dense networks without any external timing reference. Two synchronization methods are proposed and compared: i) conventional synchronization that copes with the high density of nodes by frame collision-avoidance methods (e.g., CSMA/CA) to avoid the superimposition (or collision) of synchronization signals; and ii) distributed synchronization that exploits the frames' collision to drive the network to a global synchronization. The distributed synchronization algorithm allows the network to reach a timing synchronization status based on a common beacon with the same signature broadcasted by every device. The superimposition of beacons from all the other devices enables the network synchronization, rather than preventing it. Numerical analysis evaluates the synchronization performance based on the convergence time and synchronization dispersion, both on collision and non-collision scenario, by investigating the scalability of the network. Results prove that in dense network the ensemble of signatures provides remarkable improvements of synchronization performance compared to conventional master-slave reference.",

This paradigm shift, while bringing numerous benefits and new opportunities to healthcare organizations, has raised a lot of security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a reliable, searchable and privacy-preserving e-healthcare system, which takes advantage of emerging cloud storage and IoT infrastructure and enables healthcare service providers (HSPs) to realize remote patient monitoring in a secure and regulatory compliant manner. Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom filter and aggregate message authentication code. Moreover, our system is able to support multiple HSPs through either data owner assistance or delegation. The detailed security analysis as well as the extensive simulations on a large data set with millions of records demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed system for real world healthcare applications.",

Under the environment of emerging Internet of Things (IoT), there would be an increasing demand for data analysis to better human's lives and create new economic growth points. Moreover, due to the large scope of IoT, most of the data analysis work should be done in the network edge, i.e. handled by fog computing. However, the devices which provide fog computing may not be trustable while the data privacy is often the significant concern of the IoT application users. Thus, when performing SVD for data analysis purpose, the privacy of user data should be preserved. Based on the above reasons, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving fog computing framework for SVD computation. The security and performance analysis shows the practicability of the proposed framework. Furthermore, since different applications may utilize the result of SVD operation in different ways, three applications with different objectives are introduced to show how the framework could flexibly achieve the purposes of different applications, which indicates the flexibility of the design.",

However , the massive growth in wireless devices and the push for interconnecting these devices to form an Internet of Things (IoT) can be challenging for WBANs; hence robust communication is necessary through careful medium access arbitration. In this paper, we propose a new protocol to enable WBAN operation within an IoT. Basically, we leverage the emerging Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) and promote the integration of a BLE transceiver and a Cognitive Radio module (CR) within the WBAN coordinator. Accordingly, a BLE informs WBANs through announcements about the frequency channels that are being used in their vicinity. To mitigate interference, the superframe's active period is extended to involve not only a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frame, but also a Flexible Channel Selection (FCS) and a Flexible Backup TDMA (FBTDMA) frames. The WBAN sensors that experience interference on the default channel within the TDMA frame will eventually switch to another Interference Mitigation Channel (IMC). With the help of CR, an IMC is selected for a WBAN and each interfering sensor will be allocated a time-slot within the (FBTDMA) frame to retransmit using such IMC.",

In order to tackle some of these issues, cloud computing emerged to IoT as Cloud of Things (CoT) which provides virtually unlimited cloud services to enhance the large scale IoT platforms. There are several factors to be considered in design and implementation of a CoT platform. One of the most important and challenging problems is the heterogeneity of different objects. This problem can be addressed by deploying suitable \"Middleware\". Middleware sits between things and applications that make a reliable platform for communication among things with different interfaces, operating systems, and architectures.

In this context, scarce spectrum resources must accommodate a high traffic volume with stringent requirements of low latency, high reliability and energy efficiency. Conventional centralized network architectures may not be able to fulfill these requirements due to congestion in backhaul links. This article presents a novel design of a robust dynamic edge network architecture (RDNA) for IoT which leverages the latest advances of mobile devices (e.g., their capability to act as access points, storing and computing capabilities) to dynamically harvest unused resources and mitigate network congestion. However, traffic dynamics may compromise the availability of terminal access points and channels and, thus, network connectivity. The proposed design embraces solutions at physical, access, networking, application, and business layers to improve network robustness. The high density of mobile devices provides alternatives for close connectivity which reduces interference and latency, and thus, increases reliability and energy efficiency. Moreover, the computing capabilities of mobile devices project smartness onto the edge which is desirable for autonomous and intelligent decision making. A case study is included to illustrate the performance of RDNA. Potential applications of this architecture in the context of IoT are outlined. Finally, some challenges for future research are presented.",

This consisted of four major steps: Pre-processing of the obtained image, extraction of licence plate region, segmentation and character recognition. In earlier research, direct application of Sobel edge detection algorithm or applying threshold were used as key steps to extract the licence plate region, which does not produce effective results when the captured image is subjected to the high intensity of light. The use of morphological operations causes deformity in the characters during segmentation. We propose a novel algorithm to tackle the mentioned issues through a unique edge detection algorithm. It is also a tedious task to create and update the database of required vehicles frequently. This problem is solved by the use of Internet of things(IOT) where an online database can be created and updated from any module instantly. Also, through IoT, we connect all the cameras in a geographical area to one server to create a universal eye which drastically increases the probability of tracing a vehicle over having manual database attached to each camera for identification purpose.",

These technologies are designed to coexist with existing LTE infrastructure, spectrum, and devices. We first briefly introduce both systems and then compare their performance in terms of energy consumption, latency and scalability. We introduce a model for calculating the energy consumption and study the effect of clock drift and propose a method to overcome it.

Furthermore, we implement the main functionality of both technologies and simulate the end-to-end latency and maximum number of devices in a discrete-event network simulator NS-3. Numerical results show that 8 years battery life time can be achieved by both technologies in a poor coverage scenario and that depending on the coverage conditions and data length, one technology consumes less energy than the other. The results also show that eMTC can serve more devices in a network than NB-IoT, while providing a latency that is 10 times lower.",

It is anticipated that in future IoT, an enormous number of sensors will collect the physical information every moment to enable the control center making better decisions to improve the quality of service (QoS). However, the sensors maybe faulty and thus generate inaccurate data which would compromise the decision making. To guarantee the QoS, the system should be able to detect faulty sensors so as to eliminate the damages of inaccurate data. Various faulty sensor detection mechanisms have been developed in the context of wireless sensor network (WSN). Some of them are only fit for WSN while the others would bring a communication burden to control center. To detect the faulty sensors for general IoT applications and save the communication resource at the same time, an efficient faulty sensor detection scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme takes advantage of fog computing to save the computation and communication resource of control center. To preserve the privacy of sensor data, the Paillier Cryptosystem is adopted in the fog computing. The batch verification technique is applied to achieve efficient authentication. The performance analyses are presented to demonstrate that the proposed detection scheme is able to conserve the communication resource of control center and achieve a high true positive ratio while maintaining an acceptable false positive ratio. The scheme could also withstand various security attacks and preserve data privacy.",

In this paper, the timeliness of the status is measured by the recently proposed age-of-information (AoI) metric; both the theoretical and practical aspects of the problem are investigated: we aim to obtain a scheduling policy with minimum AoI and, meanwhile, still suitable for decentralized implementation on account of signalling exchange overhead. Towards this end, we first consider the set of arrival-independent and renewal (AIR) policies; the optimal policy thereof to minimize the time-average AoI is proved to be a round-robin policy with one-packet (latest packet only and others are dropped) buffers (RR-ONE). The optimality is established based on a generalized Poisson-arrival-see-time-average (PASTA) theorem. It is further proved that RR-ONE is asymptotically optimal among all policies in the massive IoT regime. The AoI steady-state stationary distribution under RR-ONE is also derived. A fully decentralized implementation of RR-ONE is proposed which can accommodate dynamic terminal appearances. In addition, considering scenarios where packets cannot be dropped, the optimal AIR policy thereof is also found with parameters given by the solution to a convex problem.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the downward routing for network control/actuation in large-scale and heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT). We propose the Opportunistic Source Routing (OSR), a scalable and reliable downward routing protocol for WSNs/IoT. OSR introduces opportunistic routing into traditional source routing based on the parent set of a node's upward routing in data collection, significantly addressing the drastic link dynamics in low-power and lossy WSNs. We devise a novel adaptive Bloom filter mechanism to effectively and efficiently encode a downward source-route in OSR, which enables a significant reduction of the length of source-route field in packet header. OSR is scalable to very large-size WSN/IoT deployments, since each resource-constrained node in the network only stores the set of its direct children. The probabilistic nature of the Bloom filter passively explores opportunistic routing. Upon a delivery failure at any hop along the downward path, OSR actively performs opportunistic routing to bypass the obsolete/bad link. We demonstrate the desirable scalability of OSR against the standard RPL downward routing. We evaluate the performance of OSR via both simulations and real-world testbed experiments, in comparison with the standard RPL (both storing mode and non-storing mode), ORPL, and the representative dissemination protocol Drip. Our results show that OSR significantly outperforms RPL and ORPL in scalability and reliability. OSR also achieves significantly better energy efficiency compared to TinyRPL and Drip which are based on the same TinyOS platform as OSR implementation.",

However, as for Internet of Things(IoT), such as smart gird, data are often processed in batches. Therefore, developing a new random response algorithm that can support batch-processing tend to make it more efficient and suitable for IoT applications than existing random response algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new randomized response algorithm that can achieve differential-privacy and utility guar-antees for consumer's behaviors, and process a batch of data at each time. Firstly, by applying sparse coding in this algorithm, a behavior signature dictionary is created from the aggregated energy consumption data in fog. Then, we add noise into the behavior signature dictionary by classical randomized response techniques and achieve the differential privacy after data re-aggregation.

In order to solve this non-convex problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm and establish its convergence analytically. Closed-form solutions for some sub-problems are also provided. One of the sub-problems we solve in this procedure is to jointly optimize the energy and service time allocations for a given trajectory of the UAV. This problem is of interest on its own right because in some cases we may not be able to alter the UAV's trajectory based on the locations of the IoT devices (especially when its primary mission is something else).

With its technological capability of simultaneous information and energy transfer, ambient backscatter is quickly emerging as an appealing solution for this communication paradigm, especially for the links with low data rate requirement. In this paper, we study signal detection and characterize exact bit error rate for the ambient backscatter system. In particular, we formulate a binary hypothesis testing problem at the receiver and analyze system performance under three detection techniques: a) mean threshold (MT), b) maximum likelihood threshold (MLT), and c) approximate MLT. Motivated by the energy-constrained nature of IoT devices, we perform the above analyses for two receiver types: i) the ones that can accurately track channel state information (CSI), and ii) the ones that cannot. Two main features of the analysis that distinguish this work from the prior art are the characterization of the exact conditional density functions of the average received signal energy, and the characterization of exact average bit error rate (BER) for this setup. The key challenge lies in the handling of correlation between channel gains of two hypotheses for the derivation of joint probability distribution of magnitude squared channel gains that is needed for the BER analysis.",

    "abstract": "Recent standardization efforts in IEEE 802.15.4-2015 Time Scheduled Channel Hopping (TSCH) and the IETF 6TiSCH Working Group (WG), aim to provide deterministic communications and efficient allocation of resources across constrained Internet of Things (IoT) networks, particularly in Industrial IoT (IIoT) scenarios. Within 6TiSCH, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been identified as means of providing centralized control in a number of key situations. However, implementing a centralized SDN architecture in a Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) faces considerable challenges: not only is controller traffic subject to jitter due to unreliable links and network contention, but the overhead generated by SDN can severely affect the performance of other traffic. This paper proposes using 6TiSCH tracks, a Layer-2 slicing mechanism for creating dedicated forwarding paths across TSCH networks, in order to isolate the SDN control overhead. Not only does this prevent control traffic from affecting the performance of other data flows, but the properties of 6TiSCH tracks allows deterministic, low-latency SDN controller communication. Using our own lightweight SDN implementation for Contiki OS, we firstly demonstrate the effect of SDN control traffic on application data flows across a 6TiSCH network. We then show that by slicing the network through the allocation of dedicated resources along a SDN control path, tracks provide an effective means of mitigating the cost of SDN control overhead in IEEE 802.15.4-2015 TSCH networks.",

Using stochastic geometry, we propose a general analytical framework to compute the uplink and downlink coverage probabilities for both the aerial and the terrestrial cellular system. Our framework is valid for any aerial channel model for which the probabilistic functions of line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links are specified. The accuracy of the analytical results is verified by Monte Carlo simulations considering two commonly adopted aerial channel models. Our results show the non-trivial impact of the different aerial channel environments (i.e., suburban, urban, dense urban and high-rise urban) on the uplink and downlink coverage probabilities and provide design guidelines for best ABS deployment height.",

    "abstract": "Phrase search allows retrieval of documents containing an exact phrase, which plays an important role in many machine learning applications for cloud-based IoT, such as intelligent medical data analytics. In order to protect sensitive information from being leaked by service providers, documents (e.g., clinic records) are usually encrypted by data owners before being outsourced to the cloud. This, however, makes the search operation an extremely challenging task. Existing searchable encryption schemes for multi-keyword search operations fail to perform phrase search, as they are unable to determine the location relationship of multiple keywords in a queried phrase over encrypted data on the cloud server side. In this paper, we propose P3, an efficient privacy-preserving phrase search scheme for intelligent encrypted data processing in cloud-based IoT. Our scheme exploits the homomorphic encryption and bilinear map to determine the location relationship of multiple queried keywords over encrypted data. It also utilizes a probabilistic trapdoor generation algorithm to protect users search patterns. Thorough security analysis demonstrates the security guarantees achieved by P3. We implement a prototype and conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The evaluation results show that compared with existing multikeyword search schemes, P3 can greatly improve the search accuracy with moderate overheads.",

    "abstract": "Future 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) applications will heavily rely on long-range communication technologies such as low-power wireless area networks (LPWANs). In particular, LoRaWAN built on LoRa physical layer is gathering increasing interests, both from academia and industries, for enabling low-cost energy efficient IoT wireless sensor networks for, e.g., environmental monitoring over wide areas. While its communication range may go up to 20 kilometers, the achievable bit rates in LoRaWAN are limited to a few kilobits per second. In the event of collisions, the perceived rate is further reduced due to packet loss and retransmissions. Firstly, to alleviate the harmful impacts of collisions, we propose a decoding algorithm that enables to resolve several superposed LoRa signals. Our proposed method exploits the slight desynchronization of superposed signals and specific features of LoRa physical layer. Secondly, we design a full MAC protocol enabling collision resolution. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional LoRaWAN jointly in terms of system throughput, energy efficiency as well as delay. These results show that our scheme is well suited for 5G and IoT systems, as one of their major goals is to provide the best trade-off among these performance objectives.",

In each coherence block, the serving base station needs to identify the active devices and estimate their channel state information for effective communication. By exploiting the sparsity pattern of data transmission, we develop a structured group sparsity estimation method to simultaneously detect the active devices and estimate the corresponding channels. This method significantly reduces the signature sequence length while supporting massive IoT access. To determine the optimal signature sequence length, we study \\emph{the phase transition behavior} of the group sparsity estimation problem. Specifically, user activity can be successfully estimated with a high probability when the signature sequence length exceeds a threshold; otherwise, it fails with a high probability. The location and width of the phase transition region are characterized via the theory of conic integral geometry. We further develop a smoothing method to solve the high-dimensional structured estimation problem with a given limited time budget. This is achieved by sharply characterizing the convergence rate in terms of the smoothing parameter, signature sequence length and estimation accuracy, yielding a trade-off between the estimation accuracy and computational cost. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the accuracy of our theoretical results and the benefits of smoothing techniques.",

In this work, we conducted an in-depth analysis of five widely-used smart home platforms. Combining firmware analysis, network traffic interception, and blackbox testing, we reverse-engineered the details of the interactions among the participating entities. Based on the details, we inferred three legitimate state transition diagrams for the three entities, respectively. Using these state machines as a reference model, we identified a set of unexpected state transitions. To confirm and trigger the unexpected state transitions, we implemented a set of phantom devices to mimic a real device. By instructing the phantom devices to intervene in the normal entity-entity interactions, we have discovered several new vulnerabilities and a spectrum of attacks against real-world smart home platforms.",

This process is followed by minimizing resource use whenever possible in all branches of communications.

One such communication tool is Message Queue Transport Telemetry or MQTT which is an open source publisher/subscriber standard for M2M (Machine to Machine) communication. It is well known for its low energy and bandwidth footprint and thus makes it highly suitable for Green Internet of Things (IoT) messaging situations where power usage is at a premium or in mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers. It is a perfect tool for the green communication age upon us and more specifically Green IoT. One problem however with the original MQTT protocol is that it is lacking the ability to broadcast geolocation. In today's age of IoT however, it has become more pertinent to have geolocation as part of the protocol. In this paper, we add geolocation to the MQTT protocol and offer a revised version, which we call MQTTg. We describe the protocol here and show where we are able to embed geolocation successfully.

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen major innovations in developing energy-efficient wireless technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for Internet of Things (IoT). Despite demonstrating significant benefits in providing low power transmission and massive connectivity, hardly any of these technologies have made it to directly connect to the Internet. Recent advances demonstrate the viability of direct communication among heterogeneous IoT devices with incompatible physical (PHY) layers. These techniques, however, require modifications in transmission power or time, which may affect the media access control (MAC) layer behaviors in legacy networks. In this paper, we argue that the frequency domain can serve as a free side channel with minimal interruptions to legacy networks. To this end, we propose DopplerFi, a communication framework that enables a two-way communication channel between BLE and Wi-Fi by injecting artificial Doppler shifts, which can be decoded by sensing the patterns in the Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK) demodulator and Channel State Information (CSI). The artificial Doppler shifts can be compensated by the inherent frequency synchronization module and thus have a negligible impact on legacy communications. Our evaluation using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) BLE chips and 802.11-compliant testbeds have demonstrated that DopplerFi can achieve throughput up to 6.5~Kbps at the cost of merely less than 0.8% throughput loss.",

Recently, several estimators for range estimation using phase difference of arrival (PDoA) measurements of narrowband signals have been proposed. However, these estimators are based on data models which do not consider the impact of clock-skew on the range estimation. In this paper, clock-skew and range estimation are studied under a unified framework. We derive a novel and precise data model for PDoA measurements which incorporates the unknown clock-skew effects. We then formulate joint estimation of the clock-skew and range as a two-dimensional (2-D) frequency estimation problem of a single complex sinusoid. Furthermore, we propose: (i) a two-way communication protocol for collecting PDoA measurements and (ii) a weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm for joint estimation of clock-skew and range leveraging the shift invariance property of the measurement data. Finally, through numerical experiments, the performance of the proposed protocol and estimator is compared against the Cramer Rao lower bound demonstrating that the proposed estimator is asymptotically efficient.",

    "abstract": "One basic operation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks is aggregating distributed sensing-data over wireless-channels for function-computation, called wireless-data-aggregation (WDA). Targeting dense sensors, a recently developed technology called over-the-air computing (AirComp) can dramatically reduce the WDA latency by aggregating distributed data \"over-the-air\" using the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel. In this work, we design multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp for computing a vector-valued function in a clustered IoT network with multi-antenna sensors forming clusters and a multi-antenna access-point (AP) performing WDA. The resultant high-dimensional but low-rank MIMO channels makes it important to reduce channel or signal dimensionality in AirComp to avoid exposure to noise from channel null-spaces. Motivated by this, we develop a framework of reduced-dimension MIMO AirComp, featuring decomposed-aggregation-beamforming (DAB). Consider the case of separable channel-clusters with non-overlapping angle-of-arrival ranges. The optimal DAB has the structure where inner-components extract the dominant eigen-spaces of corresponding channel-clusters and outer-components jointly equalize the resultant low-dimensional channels. Consider the more complex case of inseparable clusters. We propose a suboptimal DAB design where the inner-component performs both dimension-reduction and joint-equalization over clustered-channel covariance matrices and the outer-component jointly equalizes the small-scale fading-channels. Furthermore, efficient algorithms for rank-optimization of individual DAB components and channel-feedback leveraging the AirComp principle are developed.",

Often, the sensing devices are remotely deployed with limited battery power and are equipped with energy harvesting equipment. These devices transmit real-time data to the base station (BS), which is used in applications such as anomaly detection. Under sufficient power availability, wireless transmissions from sensors can be scheduled at regular time intervals to maintain real-time data acquisition. However, once the battery is significantly depleted, the devices enter into power saving mode and need to be more selective in transmitting information to the BS. Transmitting a particular piece of sensed data consumes power while discarding it may result in loss of utility at the BS. The goal is to design an optimal dynamic policy which enables the device to decide whether to transmit or to discard a piece of sensing data particularly under the power saving mode. This will enable the sensor to prolong its operation while causing minimum loss of utility to the application. We develop an analytical framework to capture the utility of the IoT sensor transmissions and leverage dynamic programming based approach to derive an optimal real-time transmission policy that is based on the statistics of information arrival, the likelihood of harvested energy, and designed lifetime of the sensors. Numerical results show that if the statistics of future data valuation are accurately predicted, there is a significant increase in utility obtained at the BS as well as the battery lifetime.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are fundamental to the Internet of Things (IoT) by bridging the gap between the physical and the cyber worlds. Anomaly detection is a critical task in this context as it is responsible for identifying various events of interests such as equipment faults and undiscovered phenomena. However, this task is challenging because of the elusive nature of anomalies and the volatility of the ambient environments. In a resource-scarce setting like WSN, this challenge is further elevated and weakens the suitability of many existing solutions. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce autoencoder neural networks into WSN to solve the anomaly detection problem. We design a two-part algorithm that resides on sensors and the IoT cloud respectively, such that (i) anomalies can be detected at sensors in a fully distributed manner without the need for communicating with any other sensors or the cloud, and (ii) the relatively more computation-intensive learning task can be handled by the cloud with a much lower (and configurable) frequency. In addition to the minimal communication overhead, the computational load on sensors is also very low (of polynomial complexity) and readily affordable by most COTS sensors. Using a real WSN indoor testbed and sensor data collected over 4 consecutive months, we demonstrate via experiments that our proposed autoencoder-based anomaly detection mechanism achieves high detection accuracy and low false alarm rate. It is also able to adapt to unforeseeable and new changes in a non-stationary environment, thanks to the unsupervised learning feature of our chosen autoencoder neural networks.",

The bio-sensors of the proposed system assist in getting the current and precise status of the concerned patients so that in case of an emergency, the needful medical assistance can be provided. The novelty lies in the hybrid framework and the adequate support of chatbots, granular computing, context entity search and semantic analysis. The practical implementation of this system is very challenging and costly. However, it appears to be more operative and economical solution for diabetes and cardio patients.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of powerful, low-cost IoT systems, processing data closer to where the data originates, known as edge computing, has become an increasingly viable option. In addition to lowering the cost of networking infrastructures, edge computing reduces edge-cloud delay, which is essential for mission-critical applications. In this paper, we show the feasibility and study the performance of image classification using IoT devices. Specifically, we explore the relationships between various factors of image classification algorithms that may affect energy consumption such as dataset size, image resolution, algorithm type, algorithm phase, and device hardware. Our experiments show a strong, positive linear relationship between three predictor variables, namely model complexity, image resolution, and dataset size, with respect to energy consumption. In addition, in order to provide a means of predicting the energy consumption of an edge device performing image classification, we investigate the usage of three machine learning algorithms using the data generated from our experiments. The performance as well as the trade offs for using linear regression, Gaussian process, and random forests are discussed and validated. Our results indicate that the random forest model outperforms the two former algorithms, with an R-squared value of 0.95 and 0.79 for two different validation datasets.",

This paper comprehensively investigates the performance of secure short-packet communications in a mission-critical IoT system with an external multi-antenna eavesdropper. An analytical framework is proposed to approximate the average achievable secrecy throughput of the system with finite blocklength coding. To gain more insight, a simple case with a single-antenna access point (AP) is considered first, in which the secrecy throughput is approximated in a closed form. Based on that result, the optimal blocklengths to maximize the secrecy throughput with and without the reliability and latency constraints, respectively, are derived. For the case with a multi-antenna AP, following the proposed analytical framework, closed-form approximations for the secrecy throughput are obtained under both beamforming and artificial-noise-aided transmission schemes. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the proposed approximations and illustrate the impact of the system parameters on the tradeoff between transmission latency and reliability under the secrecy constraint.",

With IoT sensors and devices communicating with each other via the Internet, people can customize automation rules to meet their needs. Unless carefully defined, however, such rules can easily become points of security failure as the number of devices and complexity of rules increase. Device owners may end up unintentionally providing access or revealing private information to unauthorized entities due to complex chain reactions among devices. Prior work on trigger-action programming either focuses on conflict resolution or usability issues, or fails to accurately and efficiently detect such attack chains. This paper explores security vulnerabilities when users have the freedom to customize automation rules using trigger-action programming. We define two broad classes of attack--privilege escalation and privacy leakage--and present a practical model-checking-based system called SAFECHAIN that detects hidden attack chains exploiting the combination of rules. Built upon existing model-checking techniques, SAFECHAIN identifies attack chains by modeling the IoT ecosystem as a Finite State Machine. To improve practicability, SAFECHAIN avoids the need to accurately model an environment by frequently re-checking the automation rules given the current states, and employs rule-aware optimizations to further reduce overhead. Our comparative analysis shows that SAFECHAIN can efficiently and accurately identify attack chains, and our prototype implementation of SAFECHAIN can verify 100 rules in less than one second with no false positives.",

Approaches used for analysis include the modelling and simulation of critical infrastructure systems using attributes, functionalities, operations, and behaviours to support various security analysis viewpoints, recognising and appropriately managing associated security risks. With several critical infrastructure protection approaches available, the question of how to effectively model the complex behaviour of interconnected CNI elements and to configure their protection as a system-of-systems remains a challenge. Using a systematic review approach, existing critical infrastructure protection approaches (tools and techniques) are examined to determine their suitability given trends like IoT, and effective security modelling and analysis issues. It is found that empirical-based, agent-based, system dynamics-based, and network-based modelling are more commonly applied than economic-based and equation-based techniques, and empirical-based modelling is the most widely used. The energy and transportation critical infrastructure sectors reflect the most responsive sectors, and no one Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) approach - tool, technique, methodology or framework -- provides a fit-for-all capacity for all-round attribute modelling and simulation of security risks. Typically, deciding factors for CIP choices to adopt are often dominated by trade-offs between complexity of use and popularity of approach, as well as between specificity and generality of application in sectors.",

In order to operate within the restricted energy capacity and intermittency profile, it is proposed to innovate Intermittent Robust Computation (IRC) Unit as a new duty-cycle-variable computing approach leveraging the non-volatility inherent in spin-based switching devices. The foundations of IRC will be advanced from the device-level upwards, by extending a Spin Hall Effect Magnetic Tunnel Junction (SHE-MTJ) device. The device will then be used to realize SHE-MTJ Majority/Polymorphic Gate (MG/PG) logic approaches and libraries. Then a Logic-Embedded Flip-Flop (LE-FF) is developed to realize rudimentary Boolean logic functions along with an inherent state-holding capability within a compact footprint. Finally, the NV-Clustering synthesis procedure and corresponding tool module are proposed to instantiate the LE-FF library cells within conventional Register Transfer Language (RTL) specifications. This selectively clusters together logic and NV state-holding functionality, based on energy and area minimization criteria. It also realizes middleware-coherent, intermittent computation without checkpointing, micro-tasking, or software bloat and energy overheads vital to IoT. Simulation results for various benchmark circuits including ISCAS-89 validate functionality and power dissipation, area, and delay benefits.",

A partial implementation of RPL security mechanisms was presented recently for Contiki operating system (by Perazzo et al.), which provided us with the opportunity to examine RPL security mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the effects and challenges of using RPL security mechanisms under common routing attacks. First, a comparison of RPL performance, with and without its security mechanisms, under three routing attacks (Blackhole, Selective- Forward, and Neighbor attacks) is conducted using several metrics (e.g., average data packet delivery rate, average data packet delay, average power consumption... etc.) Based on the observations from this comparison, we came with few suggestions that could reduce the effects of such attacks, without having added security mechanisms for RPL.",

Next, we integrate orchestration by Kubernetes with S1 handovers, demonstrating MEC-based software defined network (SDN). Now, edge applications may reactively follow the UE within the radio access network (RAN), expediting low-latency. The collected data is used to analyze the benefits of the low-power MEC-enabled IoT device scheme, in which end-to-end (E2E) latency and power requirements of the UE are improved.

This paper employs the parallelism in edge computing environments to facilitate the top-k dominating query process over multiple uncertain IoT data streams. The challenges of this problem include how to quickly update the result for processing uncertainty and reduce the computation cost as well as provide highly accurate results.

In some IoT applications such as healthcare, power consumption is also a key design factor for the IoT devices. In this paper, a multi-signal compression and encoding method based on Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) is proposed that works fully in the analog domain without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Compression is achieved by quantizing all the input signals but one. While saving power, this method can also reduce the number of devices by combining one or more sensing functionalities into a single device (called 'AJSCC device'). Apart from analog encoding, AJSCC devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint modulation and multiplexing technique presents three mayor advantages---it is robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against eavesdropping, and it consumes low power due to a very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) operating region at the receiver. Performance of the proposed multi-signal compression method and FPMM technique is evaluated via simulations in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Miss Detection Rate (MDR), respectively.",

The authentication of millions of connected things and the distribution and management of secret keys between these devices pose challenging research problems. Current one-to-one authentication schemes do not take the resource limitations of IoT devices into consideration. Nor do they address the scalability problem of massive machine type communication (mMTC) networks. Group authentication schemes (GAS), on the other hand, have emerged as novel approaches for many-to-many authentication problems. They can be used to simultaneously authenticate numerous resource-constrained devices. However, existing GAS are not energy efficient, and they do not provide enough security for widespread use. In this paper, we propose a lightweight GAS that significantly reduces energy consumption on devices, providing almost 80% energy savings when compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Our approach is also resistant to the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. The proposed approach also includes a solution for key agreement and key distribution problems in mMTC environments. Moreover, this approach can be used in both centralized and decentralized group authentication scenarios.

The most challenging problem is that the effect of the weevil is not visible by humans until the palm reaches an advanced infestation state. For this reason, there is a need to use advanced technology for early detection and prevention of infestation propagation. In this project, we have developed am IoT based smart palm monitoring prototype as a proof-of-concept that (1) allows to monitor palms remotely using smart agriculture sensors, (2) contribute to the early detection of red palm weevil. Users can use web/mobile application to interact with their palm farms and help them in getting early detection of possible infestations. We used Elm company IoT platform to interface between the sensor layer and the user layer. In addition, we have collected data using accelerometer sensors and we applied signal processing and statistical techniques to analyze collected data and determine a fingerprint of the infestation.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled two-user interference channel for wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs), in which two UAVs wirelessly charge two low-power Internet-of-things (IoT)-devices on the ground and collect information from them. We consider two scenarios when both UAVs cooperate in energy transmission and/or information reception via interference coordination and coordinated multi-point (CoMP), respectively. For both scenarios, the UAVs' controllable mobility is exploited via trajectory design to not only enhance the wireless power transfer (WPT) efficiency in the downlink, but also mitigate the co-channel interference for wireless information transfer (WIT) in the uplink. In particular, the objective is to maximize the uplink common (minimum) throughput of the two IoT-devices over a finite UAV mission period, by jointly optimizing the trajectories of both UAVs and the downlink/uplink wireless resource allocation, subject to the maximum flying speed and collision avoidance constraints at UAVs, as well as the individual energy neutrality constraints at IoT-devices. Under both scenarios of interference coordination and CoMP, we first obtain the optimal solutions to the two common-rate maximization problems in well structures for the special case with sufficiently long UAV mission duration. Next, we obtain high-quality solutions for the practical case with finite UAV mission duration by using the alternating optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA).",

    "abstract": "Data collected and transmitted by Internet of things (IoT) devices are typically used for control and monitoring purposes; and hence, their timely delivery is of utmost importance for the underlying applications. However, IoT devices operate with very limited energy sources, severely reducing their ability for timely collection and processing of status updates. IoT systems make up for these limitations by employing multiple low-power low-complexity devices that can monitor the same signal, possibly with different quality observations and different energy costs, to create diversity against the limitations of individual nodes. We investigate policies to minimize the average age of information (AoI) in a monitoring system that collects data from two sources of information denoted as primary and backup sources, respectively. We assume that each source offers a different trade-off between the AoI and the energy cost. The monitoring node is equipped with a finite size battery and harvests ambient energy. For this setup, we formulate the scheduling of status updates from the two sources as a Markov decision process (MDP), and obtain a policy that decides on the optimal action to take (i.e., which source to query or remain idle) depending on the current energy level and AoI. The performance of the obtained policy is compared with an aggressive policy for different system parameters. We identify few types of optimal solution structures and discuss the benefits of having a backup source of information in the system.",

Current wearable monitors based on transdermal alcohol content (TAC) sensing are relatively bulky and have limited quantification accuracy. Here we describe the development of a discreet wearable transdermal alcohol (TAC) sensor in the form of a wristband or armband. This novel sensor can detect vapor-phase alcohol in perspiration from 0.09 ppm (equivalent to 0.09 mg/dL sweat alcohol concentration at 25 {\\deg}C under Henry's Law equilibrium) to over 500 ppm at one-minute time resolution. The TAC sensor is powered by a 110 mAh lithium battery that lasts for over 7 days. In addition, the sensor can function as a medical \"internet-of-things\" (IoT) device by connecting to an Android smartphone gateway via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and upload data to a cloud informatics system. Such wearable IoT sensors may enable large-scale alcohol-related research and personalized management. We also present evidence suggesting a hypothesis that perspiration rate is the dominant factor leading to TAC measurement variabilities, which may inform more reproducible and accurate TAC sensor designs in the future.",

    "abstract": "Today, children are increasingly connected to the Internet and consume content and services through various means. It has been a challenge for less tech-savvy parents to protect children from harmful content and services. Internet of Things (IoT) has made the situation much worse as IoT devices allow children to connect to the Internet in novel ways (e.g., connected refrigerators, TVs, and so on). In this paper, we propose mySafeHome, an approach which utilises family dynamics to provide a more natural, and intuitive access control mechanism to protect children from harmful content and services in the context of IoT. In mySafeHome, access control dynamically adapts based on the physical distance between family members. For example, a particular type of content can only be consumed, through TV, by children if the parents are in the same room (or hearing distance). mySafeHome allows parents to assess a given content by themselves. Our approach also aims to create granular levels of access control (e.g., block / limit certain content, features, services, on certain devices when the parents are not in the vicinity). We developed a prototype using OpenHAB and several smart home devices to demonstrate the proposed approach. We believe that our approach also facilitates the creation of better relationships between family members. A demo can be viewed here: http://safehome.technology/demo.",

The case of energy efficiency as an action for tackling climate change is not different: demand-response proposals or occupancy-driven energy management systems crowd the current research agenda on energy efficiency. However, there are still very few studies that have reported the effects of automation in the mid or long term beyond energy reduction (e.g. emotional feelings derived to interact with automation, complacency to the devices or perceived value of the automation throughout the time). In this workshop article, we report scientific evidence of a study conducted in ten workplaces during more than one year where we found that automating some electronic devices of common use (i.e. moving away or preventing subjects from the control of these devices) in favour of comfort and energy efficiency, is associated with a reduction of the users' confidence in science and technology as a mean to solve all environmental current problems and reduce the willingness of people to act in favor of the environment.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) is one of three primary use cases in the fifth-generation (5G) networks, and its research is still in its infancy due to its stringent and conflicting requirements in terms of extremely high reliability and low latency. To reduce latency, the channel blocklength for packet transmission is finite, which incurs transmission rate degradation and higher decoding error probability. In this case, conventional resource allocation based on Shannon capacity achieved with infinite blocklength codes is not optimal. Security is another critical issue in mission-critical internet of things (IoT) communications, and physical-layer security is a promising technique that can ensure the confidentiality for wireless communications as no additional channel uses are needed for the key exchange as in the conventional upper-layer cryptography method. This paper is the first work to study the resource allocation for a secure mission-critical IoT communication system with URLLC. Specifically, we adopt the security capacity formula under finite blocklength and consider two optimization problems: weighted throughput maximization problem and total transmit power minimization problem. Each optimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, and we develop efficient methods to solve each optimization problem. Simulation results confirm the fast convergence speed of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate the performance advantages over the existing benchmark algorithms.",

It promises to transform the digital infrastructure which powers extensive evolutions and impacts a lot of areas. Vehicle parking is a major problem in major cities around the world in both developed and developing countries. The common problems are unavailability or shortage of parking spaces, no information about tariff and no mean of searching availability of parking space online. The struggle doesn't end even if an individual finds a spot, he is required to pay in cash. This traditional and manual process takes a lot of time and causes a lot of hassle. In this paper, we provide a novel solution to the parking problem using IoT and distributed ledger technology. This system is based on pervasive computing and provides auto check-in and check-out. The user can control the system and their profile using the app on their smartphone. The major advantage of the system is an easy and online payment method. Users can pay for their parking tickets using their credit cards from their smartphone app. This decreases their hassle of carrying cash and coins for purchasing parking tickets. Smart Parking will optimize the parking mechanism, save time, reduce traffic and pollution, and provide an enhanced user experience. It is robust, secure, scalable and automated using the combination of cutting-edge technologies.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the buildings where we spend most part of our life are rapidly evolving. They are becoming fully automated environments where energy consumption, access control, heating and many other subsystems are all integrated within a single system commonly referred to as smart building (SB). To support the growing complexity of building operations, building automation systems (BAS) powering SBs are integrating consumer range Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as IP cameras alongside with operational technology (OT) controllers and actuators. However, these changes pose important cybersecurity concerns since the attack surface is larger, attack vectors are increasing and attacks can potentially harm building occupants. In this paper, we analyze the threat landscape of BASs by focusing on subsystems which are strongly affected by the advent of IoT devices such as video surveillance systems and smart lightning. We demonstrate how BAS operation can be disrupted by simple attacks to widely used network protocols. Furthermore, using both known and 0-day vulnerabilities reported in the paper and previously disclosed, we present the first (at our knowledge) BAS-specific malware which is able to persist within the BAS network by leveraging both OT and IoT devices connected to the BAS. Our research highlights how BAS networks can be considered as critical as industrial control systems and security concerns in BASs deserve more attention from both industrial and scientific communities. Even within a simulated environment, our proof-of-concept attacks were carried out with relative ease and a limited amount of budget and resources. Therefore, we believe that well-funded attack groups will increasingly shift their focus towards BASs with the potential of impacting the live of thousands of people.",

Second, in the IoT, diverse sensor nodes are operated by different organizations and use different time synchronization techniques. Thus, events with the same timestamps are not necessarily recorded at the exact same time and joined data tuples have an unknown time incoherence. This can cause undetected failures, such as false correlations and wrong predictions. We present SENSE, a system for scalable data acquisition from distributed sensors. SENSE introduces time coherence measures as a fundamental data characteristic in addition to common time synchronization techniques. The time coherence of a data tuple is the time span in which all values contained in the tuple have been read from sensors. We explore concepts and algorithms to quantify and optimize time coherence and show that SENSE scales to thousands of sensors, operates efficiently under latency and coherence constraints, and adapts to changing network conditions.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is emerging as a new paradigm to train machine learning models in distributed systems. Rather than sharing, and disclosing, the training dataset with the server, the model parameters (e.g. neural networks weights and biases) are optimized collectively by large populations of interconnected devices, acting as local learners. FL can be applied to power-constrained IoT devices with slow and sporadic connections. In addition, it does not need data to be exported to third parties, preserving privacy. Despite these benefits, a main limit of existing approaches is the centralized optimization which relies on a server for aggregation and fusion of local parameters; this has the drawback of a single point of failure and scaling issues for increasing network size. The paper proposes a fully distributed (or server-less) learning approach: the proposed FL algorithms leverage the cooperation of devices that perform data operations inside the network by iterating local computations and mutual interactions via consensus-based methods. The approach lays the groundwork for integration of FL within 5G and beyond networks characterized by decentralized connectivity and computing, with intelligence distributed over the end-devices. The proposed methodology is verified by experimental datasets collected inside an industrial IoT environment.",

Those recourse constrained devices are connected to create real-time distributed networks popularly known as the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing and edge computing. The blockchain is gaining a lot of interest in these domains to secure the system by ignoring centralized dependencies, where proof-of-work (PoW) plays a vital role to make the whole security solution decentralized. Due to the resource limitations of the devices, PoW is not suitable for blockchain-based security solutions. This paper presents a novel consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Authentication (PoAh), which introduces a cryptographic authentication mechanism to replace PoW for resource constrained devices, and to make the blockchain application-specific. PoAh is thus suitable for private as well as permissioned blockchains. Further, PoAh not only secures the systems, but also maintains system sustainability and scalability. The proposed consensus algorithm is evaluated theoretically in simulation scenarios, and in real-time hardware testbeds to validate its performance. Finally, PoAh and its integration with the blockchain in the IoT and edge computing scenarios is discussed.

Rigorous theoretical analysis is indispensable to obtain constructive insight for the networking design of massive access. In this paper, we propose and define the notion of massive and sporadic access (MSA) to quantitatively describe the massive access of IoT devices. We evaluate the temporal correlation of interference and successful transmission events, and verify that such correlation is negligible in the scenario of MSA. In view of this, in order to resolve the difficulty in any precise spatio-temporal analysis where complex interactions persist among the queues, we propose an approximation that all nodes are moving so fast that their locations are independent at different time slots. Furthermore, we compare the original static network and the equivalent network with high mobility to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approximation approach.

Existing secure pairing protocols require auxiliary equipment/peripheral (e.g., displays, speakers and sensors) to achieve authentication, which is unacceptable for low-priced devices such as smart lamps. This paper studies how to design a peripheral-free secure pairing protocol. Concretely, we design the protocol, termed SwitchPairing, via out-of-box power supplying chargers and on-board clocks, achieving security and economics at the same time. When a user wants to pair two or more devices, he/she connects the pairing devices to the same power source, and presses/releases the switch on/off button several times. Then, the press and release timing can be used to derive symmetric keys. We implement a prototype via two CC2640R2F development boards from Texas Instruments (TI) due to its prevalence. Extensive experiments and user studies are also conducted to benchmark our protocol in terms of efficiency and security.",

    "abstract": "Caching has been regarded as a promising technique to alleviate energy consumption of sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) networks by responding to users' requests with the data packets stored in the edge caching node (ECN). For real-time applications in caching enabled IoT networks, it is essential to develop dynamic status update strategies to strike a balance between the information freshness experienced by users and energy consumed by the sensor, which, however, is not well addressed. In this paper, we first depict the evolution of information freshness, in terms of age of information (AoI), at each user. Then, we formulate a dynamic status update optimization problem to minimize the expectation of a long term accumulative cost, which jointly considers the users' AoI and sensor's energy consumption. To solve this problem, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is formulated to cast the status updating procedure, and a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, with which the challenge brought by the unknown of the formulated MDP's dynamics can be addressed. Finally, simulations are conducted to validate the convergence of our proposed algorithm and its effectiveness compared with the zero-wait baseline policy.",

This feature is of particular importance to Internet of Things (IoT) with trillions of low-cost devices. In particular, for e-health IoT applications, an efficient transmission scheme is designed to solve the challenge of the limited battery capacity for numerous user equipments served by one base station. In this paper, a new multiple-input-single-output simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (MISO-SWIPT) scheme for CIM-MC-M-DCSK system is proposed by utilizing orthogonal characteristic of chaotic signals with different initial values. The proposed system adopts power splitting mode, which is very promising for simultaneously providing energy and transmitting information of the user equipments without any external power supply. In particular, the new system can achieve desirable anti-multipath-fading capability without using channel estimator. Moreover, the analytical bit-error-rate expression of the proposed system is derived over multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency of the proposed system are analyzed.

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of smart devices having built-in sensors, Internet connectivity, and programmable computation capability in the era of Internet of things (IoT), tremendous data is being generated at the network edge. Federated learning is capable of analyzing the large amount of data from a distributed set of smart devices without requiring them to upload their data to a central place. However, the commonly-used federated learning algorithm is based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and not suitable for resource-constrained IoT environments due to its high communication resource requirement. Moreover, the privacy of sensitive data on smart devices has become a key concern and needs to be protected rigorously. This paper proposes a novel federated learning framework called DP-PASGD for training a machine learning model efficiently from the data stored across resource-constrained smart devices in IoT while guaranteeing differential privacy. The optimal schematic design of DP-PASGD that maximizes the learning performance while satisfying the limits on resource cost and privacy loss is formulated as an optimization problem, and an approximate solution method based on the convergence analysis of DP-PASGD is developed to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Numerical results based on real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed DP-PASGD scheme.",

We have developed a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model, which optimizes the placement and number of the cloudlets and VMs and utilizes energy efficient routes with the objective of minimizing the total IoT network and processing power consumption. Our results show that the power consumption can be reduced by consolidating the placement of these VMs at the PON Optical Line Terminal (OLT) in cases where the traffic volume is still high after data processing, ie at low traffic reduction percentages. On the other hand, at high traffic reduction ratios, better power efficiency can be accomplished by placing VMs in lower layer nodes (relays). Our results indicate that utilizing PONs and serving heterogeneous VMs can save up to 19% of the total power. Based on the MILP model insights, a heuristic is developed with very comparable MILP-heuristic power consumption values. We considered three scenarios that represent different levels of homogeneous and heterogeneous VM CPU demands. Good agreement was observed between the heuristic results (17% power saving) and the MILP which results in 19% power saving.",

    "abstract": "Most recently, with the proliferation of IoT devices, computational nodes in manufacturing systems IIoT(Industrial-Internet-of-things) and the lunch of 5G networks, there will be millions of connected devices generating a massive amount of data. In such an environment, the controlling systems need to be intelligent enough to deal with a vast amount of data to detect defects in a real-time process. Driven by such a need, artificial intelligence models such as deep learning have to be deployed into IIoT systems. However, learning and using deep learning models are computationally expensive, so an IoT device with limited computational power could not run such models. To tackle this issue, edge intelligence had emerged as a new paradigm towards running Artificial Intelligence models on edge devices. Although a considerable amount of studies have been proposed in this area, the research is still in the early stages. In this paper, we propose a novel edge-based multi-phase pruning pipelines to ensemble learning on IIoT devices. In the first phase, we generate a diverse ensemble of pruned models, then we apply integer quantisation, next we prune the generated ensemble using a clustering-based technique. Finally, we choose the best representative from each generated cluster to be deployed to a distributed IoT environment. On CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10, our proposed approach was able to outperform the predictability levels of a baseline model (up to 7%), more importantly, the generated learners have small sizes (up to 90% reduction in the model size) that minimise the required computational capabilities to make an inference on the resource-constraint devices.",

However, no work (to the best of our knowledge) has investigated the use of the security mechanisms included in RPL standard, mainly because there was no implementation for these features in any IoT operating systems yet. A partial implementation of RPL security mechanisms was presented recently for the Contiki operating system (by Perazzo et al.), which provided us with an opportunity to examine RPL security mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the effects and challenges of using RPL security mechanisms under common routing attacks. First, a comparison of RPL performance, with and without its security mechanisms, under four routing attacks (Blackhole, Selective-Forward, Neighbor, and Wormhole attacks) is conducted using several metrics (e.g., average data packet delivery rate, average data packet delay, average power consumption, etc.). This comparison is performed using two commonly used Radio Duty-Cycle protocols. Secondly, and based on the observations from this comparison, we propose two techniques that could reduce the effects of such attacks, without having added security mechanisms for RPL. An evaluation of these techniques shows improved performance of RPL under the investigated attacks, except for the Wormhole attack.",

    "abstract": "Many Internet of things (IoT) applications have been developed and implemented on unreliable wireless networks like the Delay tolerant network (DTN), however, efficient data transfer in DTN is still an important issue for the IoT applications. One of the application areas of DTN is Vehicular Delay Tolerant Network (VDTN) where the network faces communication disruption due to lack of end-to-end relay route. It is challenging as some of the nodes show selfish behavior to preserve their resources like memory, and energy level and become non-cooperative. In this article, an Honesty based Democratic Scheme (HBDS) is introduced where vehicles with higher honesty level are elected as heads -- during the process. Vehicles involved in the process would maximize their rewards (reputation) through active participation in the network activities whereas nodes with non-cooperative selfish behavior are punished. The honesty level of the heads is analyzed using Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG) model. The mathematical model and algorithms developed in the proposed HBDS technique are simulated using the VDTNSim framework to evaluate their efficiency. The performance results show that the proposed scheme dominates current schemes in terms of packet delivery probability, packet delivery delay, number of packets drop, and overhead ratio.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining peer-to-peer connectivity with low energy overhead is a key requirement for several emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It is also desirable to develop such connectivity solutions for non-static network topologies, so that resilience to device failures can be fully realized. Decentralized clustering has emerged as a promising technique to address this critical challenge. Clustering of nodes around cluster heads (CHs) provides an energy-efficient two-tier framework for peer-to-peer communication. At the same time, decentralization ensures that the framework can quickly adapt to a dynamically changing network topology. Although some decentralized clustering solutions have been proposed in the literature, they either lack guarantees on connectivity or incur significant energy overhead to maintain the clusters. In this paper, we present Decentralized Connected Resilient IoT Clustering (DeCoRIC), an energy-efficient clustering scheme that is self-organizing and resilient to network changes while guaranteeing connectivity. Using experiments implemented on the Contiki simulator, we show that our clustering scheme adapts itself to node faults in a time-bound manner. Our experiments show that DeCoRIC achieves 100% connectivity among all nodes while improving the power efficiency of nodes in the system compared to the state-of-the-art techniques BEEM and LEACH by up to 110% and 70%, respectively. The improved power efficiency also translates to longer lifetime before first node death with a best-case of 109% longer than BEEM and 42% longer than LEACH.",

Building up such flexibility within the edge-to-cloud continuum consisting of a distributed networked ecosystem of heterogeneous computing resources is challenging. Load-balancing for fog computing becomes a cornerstone for cost-effective system management and operations. This paper studies two optimization objectives and formulates a decentralized load-balancing problem for IoT service placement: (global) IoT workload balance and (local) quality of service, in terms of minimizing the cost of deadline violation, service deployment, and unhosted services. The proposed solution, EPOS Fog, introduces a decentralized multiagent system for collective learning that utilizes edge-to-cloud nodes to jointly balance the input workload across the network and minimize the costs involved in service execution. The agents locally generate possible assignments of requests to resources and then cooperatively select an assignment such that their combination maximizes edge utilization while minimizes service execution cost. Extensive experimental evaluation with realistic Google cluster workloads on various networks demonstrates the superior performance of EPOS Fog in terms of workload balance and quality of service, compared to approaches such as First Fit and exclusively Cloud-based. The findings demonstrate how distributed computational resources on the edge can be utilized more cost-effectively by harvesting collective intelligence.",

We describe a measurement campaign performed in a system of long underground tunnels, and we analyse linear regression models involving the engineered features. We show that the current empirical models for NB-IoT signal attenuation are inaccurate in a deep-indoor scenario.

However, due to resource constraints and privacy challenges, edge IoT devices may not be able to transmit their collected data to a central controller for training machine learning models. To overcome this challenge, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a means for enabling edge devices to train a shared machine learning model without data exchanges thus reducing communication overhead and preserving data privacy. However, Google's seminal FL algorithm requires all devices to be directly connected with a central controller, which significantly limits its application scenarios. In this context, this paper introduces a novel FL framework, called collaborative FL (CFL), which enables edge devices to implement FL with less reliance on a central controller. The fundamentals of this framework are developed and then, a number of communication techniques are proposed so as to improve the performance of CFL. To this end, an overview of centralized learning, Google's seminal FL, and CFL is first presented. For each type of learning, the basic architecture as well as its advantages, drawbacks, and usage conditions are introduced. Then, three CFL performance metrics are presented and a suite of communication techniques ranging from network formation, device scheduling, mobility management, and coding is introduced to optimize the performance of CFL. For each technique, future research opportunities are also discussed. In a nutshell, this article will showcase how the proposed CFL framework can be effectively implemented at the edge of large-scale wireless systems such as the Internet of Things.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a neural network which uses filters based on logistic mapping (LogNNet). LogNNet has a feedforward network structure, but possesses the properties of reservoir neural networks. The input weight matrix, set by a recurrent logistic mapping, forms the kernels that transform the input space to the higher-dimensional feature space. The most effective recognition of a handwritten digit from MNIST-10 occurs under chaotic behavior of the logistic map. The correlation of classification accuracy with the value of the Lyapunov exponent was obtained. An advantage of LogNNet implementation on IoT devices is the significant savings in memory used. At the same time, LogNNet has a simple algorithm and performance indicators comparable to those of the best resource-efficient algorithms available at the moment. The presented network architecture uses an array of weights with a total memory size from 1 to 29 kB and achieves a classification accuracy of 80.3-96.3%. Memory is saved due to the processor, which sequentially calculates the required weight coefficients during the network operation using the analytical equation of the logistic mapping. The proposed neural network can be used in implementations of artificial intelligence based on constrained devices with limited memory, which are integral blocks for creating ambient intelligence in modern IoT environments. From a research perspective, LogNNet can contribute to the understanding of the fundamental issues of the influence of chaos on the behavior of reservoir-type neural networks.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of recommending resilient and predictive actions for an IoT network in the presence of faulty components, considering the presence of human operators manipulating the information of the environment the agent sees for containment purposes. The IoT network is formulated as a directed graph with a known topology whose objective is to maintain a constant and resilient flow between a source and a destination node. The optimal route through this network is evaluated via a predictive and resilient Q-learning algorithm which takes into account historical data about irregular operation, due to faults, as well as the feedback from the human operators that are considered to have extra information about the status of the network concerning locations likely to be targeted by attacks. To showcase our method, we utilize anonymized data from Arlington County, Virginia, to compute predictive and resilient scheduling policies for a smart water supply system, while avoiding (i) all the locations indicated to be attacked according to human operators (ii) as many as possible neighborhoods detected to have leaks or other faults. This method incorporates both the adaptability of the human and the computation capability of the machine to achieve optimal implementation containment and recovery actions in water distribution.",

    "abstract": "Smart home IoT systems often rely on cloud-based servers for communication between components. Although there exists a body of work on IoT security, most of it focuses on securing clients (i.e., IoT devices). However, cloud servers can also be compromised. Existing approaches do not typically protect smart home systems against compromised cloud servers. This paper presents FIDELIUS: a runtime system for secure cloud-based storage and communication even in the presence of compromised servers. FIDELIUS's design is tailored for smart home systems that have intermittent Internet access. In particular, it supports local control of smart home devices in the event that communication with the cloud is lost, and provides a consistency model using transactions to mitigate inconsistencies that can arise due to network partitions. We have implemented FIDELIUS, developed a smart home benchmark that uses FIDELIUS, and measured FIDELIUS's performance and power consumption. Our experiments show that compared to the commercial Particle.io framework, FIDELIUS reduces more than 50% of the data communication time and increases battery life by 2X. Compared to PyORAM, an alternative (ORAM-based) oblivious storage implementation, FIDELIUS has 4-7X faster access times with 25-43X less data transferred.",

The entity of the issue escalates in industrial IoT (IIoT) applications, which instead have stringent quality-of-service requirements and exhibit very-low error tolerance. The constant growth of wireless applications over unlicensed bands mandates then the adoption of dynamic spectrum access techniques, which can greatly benefit from interference mapping over multiple dimensions of the radio space. In this article, the authors analyze the critical role of real-time interference detection and classification mechanisms that rely on IIoT devices only, without the added complexity of specialized hardware. The trade-offs between classification performance and feasibility are analyzed in connection with the implementation on low-complexity IIoT devices. Moreover, the authors explain how to use such mechanisms for enabling IIoT networks to construct and maintain multidimensional interference maps at run-time in an autonomous fashion. Lastly, the authors give an overview of the opportunities and challenges of using interference maps to enhance the performance of IIoT networks under interference.",

Cloud Computing cannot be used for OT involving industrial applications, since it cannot guar-antee stringent non-functional requirements, e.g., dependability, trustworthiness and timeliness. Instead, a new computing paradigm, called Fog Computing, is envisioned as an architectural means to realize the IT/OT convergence. In this paper we propose a Fog Computing Platform (FCP) reference architecture targeting Industrial IoT applications. The FCP is based on: deter-ministic virtualization that reduces the effort required for safety and security assurance; middle-ware for supporting both critical control and dynamic Fog applications; deterministic networking and interoperability, using open standards such as IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA); mechanisms for resource management and or-chestration; and services for security, fault tolerance and distributed machine learning.

    "abstract": "With the emergence of IoT (Internet of things), huge amounts of sensitive data are being processed and transmitted everyday in edge devices with little to no security. Due to their aggressive power management schemes, it is a common and necessary technique to make a back-up of their program states and other necessary data in a non-volatile memory (NVM) before going to sleep or low power mode. However, this memory is often left unprotected as adding robust security measures tends to be expensive for these resource constrained systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight security system for NVM during low power mode. This security architecture uses the memristor, an emerging nanoscale device which is used to build hardware security primitives like PUF (physical unclonable function) based encryption-decryption, true random number generators (TRNG), and memory integrity checking. A reliability enhancement technique for this PUF is also proposed which shows how this system would work even with less-than-100\\% reliable PUF responses. Together, with all these techniques, we have established a dual layer security protocol (data encryption+integrity check) which provides reasonable security to an embedded processor while being very lightweight in terms of area, power, and computation time. A complete system design is demonstrated with 65$n$m CMOS and emerging memristive technology. With this, we have provided a detailed and accurate estimation of resource overhead. Analysis of the security of the whole system is also provided.",

    "abstract": "Massive access for Internet-of-Things (IoT) in beyond 5G networks represents a daunting challenge for conventional bandwidth-limited technologies. Millimeter-wave technologies (mmWave)---which provide large chunks of bandwidth at the cost of more complex wireless processors in harsher radio environments---is a promising alternative to accommodate massive IoT but its cost and power requirements are an obstacle for wide adoption in practice. In this context, meta-materials arise as a key innovation enabler to address this challenge by Re-configurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). In this paper we take on the challenge and study a beyond 5G scenario consisting of a multi-antenna base station (BS) serving a large set of single-antenna user equipments (UEs) with the aid of RISs to cope with non-line-of-sight paths. Specifically, we build a mathematical framework to jointly optimize the precoding strategy of the BS and the RIS parameters in order to minimize the system sum mean squared error (SMSE). This novel approach reveals convenient properties used to design two algorithms, RISMA and Lo-RISMA, which are able to either find simple and efficient solutions to our problem (the former) or accommodate practical constraints with low-resolution RISs (the latter). Numerical results show that our algorithms outperform conventional benchmarks that do not employ RIS (even with low-resolution meta-surfaces) with gains that span from 20% to 120% in sum rate performance.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning on tiny IoT devices based on microcontroller units (MCU) is appealing but challenging: the memory of microcontrollers is 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller even than mobile phones. We propose MCUNet, a framework that jointly designs the efficient neural architecture (TinyNAS) and the lightweight inference engine (TinyEngine), enabling ImageNet-scale inference on microcontrollers. TinyNAS adopts a two-stage neural architecture search approach that first optimizes the search space to fit the resource constraints, then specializes the network architecture in the optimized search space. TinyNAS can automatically handle diverse constraints (i.e.device, latency, energy, memory) under low search costs.TinyNAS is co-designed with TinyEngine, a memory-efficient inference library to expand the search space and fit a larger model. TinyEngine adapts the memory scheduling according to the overall network topology rather than layer-wise optimization, reducing the memory usage by 4.8x, and accelerating the inference by 1.7-3.3x compared to TF-Lite Micro and CMSIS-NN. MCUNet is the first to achieves >70% ImageNet top1 accuracy on an off-the-shelf commercial microcontroller, using 3.5x less SRAM and 5.7x less Flash compared to quantized MobileNetV2 and ResNet-18. On visual&audio wake words tasks, MCUNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and runs 2.4-3.4x faster than MobileNetV2 and ProxylessNAS-based solutions with 3.7-4.1x smaller peak SRAM.

Such applications can be provided upon the vast infrastructures of Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing (EC). IoT devices collect ambient data transferring them towards the EC and Cloud for further processing. EC nodes could become the hosts of distributed datasets where various processing activities take place. The future of EC involves numerous nodes interacting with the IoT devices and themselves in a cooperative manner to realize the desired processing. A critical issue for concluding this cooperative approach is the exchange of data synopses to have EC nodes informed about the data present in their peers. Such knowledge will be useful for decision making related to the execution of processing activities. In this paper, we propose n uncertainty driven model for the exchange of data synopses. We argue that EC nodes should delay the exchange of synopses especially when no significant differences with historical values are present. Our mechanism adopts a Fuzzy Logic (FL) system to decide when there is a significant difference with the previous reported synopses to decide the exchange of the new one. Our scheme is capable of alleviating the network from numerous messages retrieved even for low fluctuations in synopses. We analytically describe our model and evaluate it through a large set of experiments. Our experimental evaluation targets to detect the efficiency of the approach based on the elimination of unnecessary messages while keeping immediately informed peer nodes for significant statistical changes in the distributed datasets.",

    "abstract": "Due to the strong analytical ability of big data, deep learning has been widely applied to train the collected data in industrial IoT. However, for privacy issues, traditional data-gathering centralized learning is not applicable to industrial scenarios sensitive to training sets. Recently, federated learning has received widespread attention, since it trains a model by only relying on gradient aggregation without accessing training sets. But existing researches reveal that the shared gradient still retains the sensitive information of the training set. Even worse, a malicious aggregation server may return forged aggregated gradients. In this paper, we propose the VFL, verifiable federated learning with privacy-preserving for big data in industrial IoT. Specifically, we use Lagrange interpolation to elaborately set interpolation points for verifying the correctness of the aggregated gradients. Compared with existing schemes, the verification overhead of VFL remains constant regardless of the number of participants. Moreover, we employ the blinding technology to protect the privacy of the gradients submitted by the participants. If no more than n-2 of n participants collude with the aggregation server, VFL could guarantee the encrypted gradients of other participants not being inverted. Experimental evaluations corroborate the practical performance of the presented VFL framework with high accuracy and efficiency.",

There is a need to use a common backbone network that facilitates interoperability and seamless data exchange in a uniform way. In this paper, we present EMIoT, a novel solution for smart buildings that breaks these barriers by leveraging existing emergency lighting systems. In EMIoT, we embed a wireless LoRa module in each emergency light to turn them into wireless routers. EMIoT has been deployed in more than 50 buildings of different types in Sydney Australia and has been successfully running over two years. We present the design and implementation of EMIoT in this paper. Moreover, we use the deployment in a residential building as a use case to show the performance of EMIoT in real-world environments and share lessons learned. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of EMIoT. This paper provides practical insights for IoT deployment in smart buildings for practitioners and solution providers.",

    "abstract": "The emergent ecosystems of intelligent edge devices in diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications, from automatic surveillance to precision agriculture, increasingly rely on recording and processing variety of image data. Due to resource constraints, e.g., energy and communication bandwidth requirements, these applications require compressing the recorded images before transmission. For these applications, image compression commonly requires: (1) maintaining features for coarse-grain pattern recognition instead of the high-level details for human perception due to machine-to-machine communications; (2) high compression ratio that leads to improved energy and transmission efficiency; (3) large dynamic range of compression and an easy trade-off between compression factor and quality of reconstruction to accommodate a wide diversity of IoT applications as well as their time-varying energy/performance needs. To address these requirements, we propose, MAGIC, a novel machine learning (ML) guided image compression framework that judiciously sacrifices visual quality to achieve much higher compression when compared to traditional techniques, while maintaining accuracy for coarse-grained vision tasks. The central idea is to capture application-specific domain knowledge and efficiently utilize it in achieving high compression. We demonstrate that the MAGIC framework is configurable across a wide range of compression/quality and is capable of compressing beyond the standard quality factor limits of both JPEG 2000 and WebP. We perform experiments on representative IoT applications using two vision datasets and show up to 42.65x compression at similar accuracy with respect to the source. We highlight low variance in compression rate across images using our technique as compared to JPEG 2000 and WebP.",

We prove that it is possible to detect and identify with overwhelming probability their presence and the services running by the aforementioned devices in a crowded WiFi scenario. This work proves that standard encryption techniques alone are not sufficient to protect the privacy of the end-user, since the network traffic itself exposes the presence of both the device and the associated service.

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that large-scale Internet of Things (IoT)-based load altering attacks can have a serious impact on power grid operations such as causing unsafe frequency excursions and destabilizing the grid's control loops. In this work, we present an analytical framework to investigate the impact of IoT-based static/dynamic load altering attacks (S/DLAAs) on the power grid's dynamic response. Existing work on this topic has mainly relied on numerical simulations and, to date, there is no analytical framework to identify the victim nodes from which that attacker can launch the most impactful attacks. To address these shortcomings, we use results from second-order dynamical systems to analyze the power grid frequency control loop under S/DLAAs. We use parametric sensitivity of the system's eigensolutions to identify victim nodes that correspond to the least-effort destabilizing DLAAs. Further, to analyze the SLAAs, we present closed-form expression for the system's frequency response in terms of the attacker's inputs, helping us characterize the minimum load change required to cause unsafe frequency excursions. Using these results, we formulate the defense against S/DLAAs as a linear programming problem in which we determine the minimum amount of load that needs to be secured at the victim nodes to ensure system safety/stability. Extensive simulations conducted using benchmark IEEE-bus systems validate the accuracy and efficacy of our approach.",

In the considered scenario, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collects computing tasks from IoT devices and then makes online offloading decisions, in which the tasks can be processed at the UAV or offloaded to the nearby base station or the remote satellite. Our objective is to design a task scheduling policy that minimizes offloading and computing delay of all tasks given the UAV energy capacity constraint. To this end, we first formulate the online scheduling problem as an energy-constrained Markov decision process (MDP). Then, considering the task arrival dynamics, we develop a novel deep risk-sensitive reinforcement learning algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm evaluates the risk, which measures the energy consumption that exceeds the constraint, for each state and searches the optimal parameter weighing the minimization of delay and risk while learning the optimal policy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the task processing delay by up to 30% compared to probabilistic configuration methods while satisfying the UAV energy capacity constraint.",

To address this challenge, we are proposing a novel IoT malware traffic analysis approach using deep learning and visual representation for faster detection and classification of new malware (zero-day malware). The detection of malicious network traffic in the proposed approach works at the package level, significantly reducing the time of detection with promising results due to the deep learning technologies used. To evaluate our proposed method performance, a dataset is constructed which consists of 1000 pcap files of normal and malware traffic that are collected from different network traffic sources.

    "abstract": "Intelligent vehicular systems and smart city applications are the fastest growing Internet of things (IoT) implementations at a compound annual growth rate of 30%. In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and smart city environments.",

We formulate the path planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous team of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor nodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path planning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve by training a double deep Q-network (DDQN) to approximate the optimal UAV control policy. By exploiting global-local maps of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers of the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task among themselves, adapt to large state spaces, and make movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time efficiency, and navigation constraints.",

    "abstract": "Honey bees have been domesticated by humans for several thousand years and mainly provide honey and pollination, which is fundamental for plant reproduction. Nowadays, the work of beekeepers is constrained by external factors that stress their production (parasites and pesticides among others). Taking care of large numbers of beehives is time-consuming, so integrating sensors to track their status can drastically simplify the work of beekeepers. Precision bee-keeping complements beekeepers' work thanks to the In-ternet of Things (IoT) technology. If used correctly, data can help to make the right diagnosis for honey bees colony, increase honey production and decrease bee mortality. Providing enough energy for on-hive and in-hive sensors is a challenge. Some solutions rely on energy harvesting, others target usage of large batteries. Either way, it is mandatory to analyze the energy usage of embedded equipment in order to design an energy efficient and autonomous bee monitoring system. This paper relies on a fully autonomous IoT framework that collects environmental and image data of a beehive. It consists of a data collecting node (environmental data sensors, camera, Raspberry Pi and Arduino) and a solar energy supplying node. Supported services are analyzed task by task from an energy profiling and efficiency standpoint , in order to identify the highly pressured areas of the framework. This first step will guide our goal of designing a sustainable precision beekeeping system, both technically and energy-wise.",

These capabilities will be available both on pre-existing entities but also on virtual entities, i.e. that will be dynamically created in the Cloud according to the need. In this new ecosystem, meeting the end-to-end QoS needs of these future applications is a major challenge. This challenge has particularly to be tackled both at the level of the Middleware intermediary entities and at the level of the networks interconnecting these entities. In this context, this paper presents our approach for a self-adaptive QoS management at the middleware level for IoT applications. This approach is aimed at: 1) taking advantage of the technological opportunities offered by the Cloud, the dynamic deployment of processing functions and the autonomic computing paradigm, 2) taking into account the hetero-geneity of the solutions that will coexist in this landscape, and 3) ensuring the consistency of the (re) configuration choices thanks to appropriate theoretical tools.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of IoT sensors and edge devices makes it possible to use deep learning models to recognise daily activities locally using in-home monitoring technologies. Recently, federated learning systems that use edge devices as clients to collect and utilise IoT sensory data for human activity recognition have been commonly used as a new way to combine local (individual-level) and global (group-level) models. This approach provides better scalability and generalisability and also offers higher privacy compared with the traditional centralised analysis and learning models. The assumption behind federated learning, however, relies on supervised learning on clients. This requires a large volume of labelled data, which is difficult to collect in uncontrolled IoT environments such as remote in-home monitoring. In this paper, we propose an activity recognition system that uses semi-supervised federated learning, wherein clients conduct unsupervised learning on autoencoders with unlabelled local data to learn general representations, and a cloud server conducts supervised learning on an activity classifier with labelled data. Our experimental results show that using autoencoders and a long short-term memory (LSTM) classifier, the accuracy of our proposed system is comparable to that of a supervised federated learning system. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that our system is not affected by the Non-IID distribution of local data, and can even achieve better accuracy than supervised federated learning on some datasets. Additionally, we show that our proposed system can reduce the number of needed labels in the system and the size of local models without losing much accuracy, and has shorter local activity recognition time than supervised federated learning.",

Satellites can be exploited to extend the coverage of terrestrial fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks. However, satellites are restricted by their high latency and relatively low data rate. Hence, the integration of terrestrial and satellite components, taking advantage of both networks, has been widely studied to enable seamless broadband coverage. Due to the significant difference between satellite communications (SatComs) and terrestrial communications (TerComs) in terms of channel fading, transmission delay, mobility, and coverage performance, the establishment of an efficient hybrid satellite-terrestrial network (HSTN) still faces many challenges. In general, it is difficult to decompose a HSTN into the sum of separated satellite and terrestrial links, due to complicated coupling relationships therein. To uncover the complete picture of HSTNs, we regard the HSTN as a combination of basic cooperative models, which contain the main traits of satellite-terrestrial integration, but are much simpler and thus more tractable than the whole network. Particularly, we present three basic cooperative models for HSTNs and provide a survey of the state-of-the-art technologies for each of them. We investigate some main problems and their solutions, including cooperative pattern, performance analysis and resource management issues. We also discuss open issues to envision an agile, smart, and secure HSTN for the sixth-generation (6G) ubiquitous IoT.",

To do that, a joint queuing theory and stochastic geometry model is utilized to develop a spatio-temporal analytical model. Particularly, the harvested energy and packet transmission success probability are characterized using tools from stochastic geometry. {Moreover, each device is modeled using a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). Such two dimensions are utilized to jointly track the scavenged/depleted energy to/from the batteries along with the arrival/departure of packets to/from devices buffers over time. Consequently, the adopted queuing model represents the devices as spatially interacting queues. To that end, the network performance is assessed in light of the packet throughput, the average delay, and the average buffer size.

Network function virtualization (NFV) is viewed as a new paradigm in allocating network resources on demand. Satellite edge computing combined with the NFV technology is becoming an emerging topic. In this paper, we propose a potential game approach for virtual network function (VNF) placement in satellite edge computing. The problem of VNF placement aims to maximize the number of allocated IoT device users, while minimizing the overall deployment cost. Therefore, we formulate the optimization problem of VNF placement with maximum network payoff as a potential game and analyze the problem by a game-theoretical approach. Then we implement a decentralized resource allocation algorithm based on a potential game (PGRA) for tackling the problem of VNF placement by finding a Nash equilibrium solution. Finally, we conduct the experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed PGRA algorithm.

ICN can benefit from Complex Event Processing (CEP), which is an in-network processing paradigm to specify and perform efficient query operations on data streams. However, integrating CEP into ICN is a challenging task due to the following reasons: (1) typical ICN architectures do not provide support for forwarding and processing continuous data streams; (2) IoT applications often need short response times and require robust event detection, which both are hard to accomplish using existing CEP systems. In this article, we present a novel network architecture, called INetCEP, for efficient CEP-based in-network processing as part of ICN. INetCEP enables efficient data processing in ICN by means of (1) a unified communication model that supports continuous data streams, (2) a meta query language for CEP to specify data processing operations in the data plane, and (3) query processing algorithms to resolve the specified operations. Our experimental results for two IoT use cases and datasets show that INetCEP offers very short response times of up to 73 {\\mu}s under high workload and is more than 15X faster in terms of forwarding events than the state-of-the-art CEP system Flink. Furthermore, the delivery and processing of complex queries is around 32X faster than Flink and more than 100X faster than a naive pull-based reference approach, while maintaining 100% accuracy.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers a cooperative Internet of Things (IoT) system with a source aiming to transmit randomly generated status updates to a designated destination as timely as possible under the help of a relay. We adopt a recently proposed concept, the age of information (AoI), to characterize the timeliness of the status updates. In the considered system, delivering the status updates via the one-hop direct link will have a shorter transmission time at the cost of incurring a higher error probability, while the delivery of status updates through the two-hop relay link could be more reliable at the cost of suffering longer transmission time. Thus, it is important to design the relaying protocol of the considered system for optimizing the information freshness. Considering the limited capabilities of IoT devices, we propose two low-complexity age-oriented relaying (AoR) protocols, i.e., the source-prioritized AoR (SP-AoR) protocol and the relay-prioritized AoR (RP-AoR) protocol, to reduce the AoI of the considered system. By carefully analyzing the evolution of the instantaneous AoI, we derive closed-form expressions of the average AoI for both proposed AoR protocols. We further optimize the generation probability of the status updates at the source in both protocols. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that the two proposed protocols outperform each other under various system parameters. Moreover, the protocol with better performance can achieve near-optimal performance compared with the optimal scheduling policy attained by applying the Markov decision process (MDP) tool.",

    "abstract": "Bilinear pairing is a fundamental operation that is widely used in cryptographic algorithms (e.g., identity-based cryptographic algorithms) to secure IoT applications. Nonetheless, the time complexity of bilinear pairing is $O(n^3)$, making it a very time-consuming operation, especially for resource-constrained IoT devices. Secure outsourcing of bilinear pairing has been studied in recent years to enable computationally weak devices to securely outsource the bilinear pairing to untrustworthy cloud servers. However, the state-of-art algorithms often require to pre-compute and store some values, which results in storage burden for devices. In the Internet of Things, devices are generally with very limited storage capacity. Thus, the existing algorithms do not fit the IoT well. In this paper, we propose a secure outsourcing algorithm of bilinear pairings, which does not require pre-computations. In the proposed algorithm, the outsourcer side's efficiency is significantly improved compared with executing the original bilinear pairing operation. At the same time, the privacy of the input and output is ensured. Also, we apply the Ethereum blockchain in our outsourcing algorithm to enable fair payments, which ensures that the cloud server gets paid only when he correctly accomplished the outsourced work. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and secure.",

    "abstract": "Smartphones, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet-of-things (IoT) devices are considered the primary data source for a distributed network. Due to a revolutionary breakthrough in internet availability and continuous improvement of the IoT devices capabilities, it is desirable to store data locally and perform computation at the edge, as opposed to share all local information with a centralized computation agent. A recently proposed Machine Learning (ML) algorithm called Federated Learning (FL) paves the path towards preserving data privacy, performing distributed learning, and reducing communication overhead in large-scale machine learning (ML) problems. This paper proposes an FL model by monitoring client activities and leveraging available local computing resources, particularly for resource-constrained IoT devices (e.g., mobile robots), to accelerate the learning process. We assign a trust score to each FL client, which is updated based on the client's activities. We consider a distributed mobile robot as an FL client with resource limitations either in memory, bandwidth, processor, or battery life. We consider such mobile robots as FL clients to understand their resource-constrained behavior in a real-world setting. We consider an FL client to be untrustworthy if the client infuses incorrect models or repeatedly gives slow responses during the FL process. After disregarding the ineffective and unreliable client, we perform local training on the selected FL clients. To further reduce the straggler issue, we enable an asynchronous FL mechanism by performing aggregation on the FL server without waiting for a long period to receive a particular client's response.",

Therefore, it is important to identify customers who potentially become unsatisfied and might lead to escalations. Today this prioritization of customers is often done manually. Data science on IoT data (esp. log data) for machine health monitoring, as well as analytics on enterprise data for customer relationship management (CRM) have mainly been researched and applied independently. In this paper, we present a framework for a data-driven decision support system which combines IoT and enterprise data to model customer sentiment. Such decision support systems can help to prioritize customers and service resources to effectively troubleshoot problems or even avoid them. The framework is applied in a real-world case study with a major medical device manufacturer. This includes a fully automated and interpretable machine learning pipeline designed to meet the requirements defined with domain experts and end users. The overall framework is currently deployed, learns and evaluates predictive models from terabytes of IoT and enterprise data to actively monitor the customer sentiment for a fleet of thousands of high-end medical devices. Furthermore, we provide an anonymized industrial benchmark dataset for the research community.",

    "abstract": "In the era when the market segment of Internet of Things (IoT) tops the chart in various business reports, it is apparently envisioned that the field of medicine expects to gain a large benefit from the explosion of wearables and internet-connected sensors that surround us to acquire and communicate unprecedented data on symptoms, medication, food intake, and daily-life activities impacting one's health and wellness. However, IoT-driven healthcare would have to overcome many barriers, such as: 1) There is an increasing demand for data storage on cloud servers where the analysis of the medical big data becomes increasingly complex, 2) The data, when communicated, are vulnerable to security and privacy issues, 3) The communication of the continuously collected data is not only costly but also energy hungry, 4) Operating and maintaining the sensors directly from the cloud servers are non-trial tasks. This book chapter defined Fog Computing in the context of medical IoT. Conceptually, Fog Computing is a service-oriented intermediate layer in IoT, providing the interfaces between the sensors and cloud servers for facilitating connectivity, data transfer, and queryable local database. The centerpiece of Fog computing is a low-power, intelligent, wireless, embedded computing node that carries out signal conditioning and data analytics on raw data collected from wearables or other medical sensors and offers efficient means to serve telehealth interventions. We implemented and tested an fog computing system using the Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi that allows acquisition, computing, storage and communication of the various medical data such as pathological speech data of individuals with speech disorders, Phonocardiogram (PCG) signal for heart rate estimation, and Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based Q, R, S detection.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of IoT devices makes them an ideal target for attackers. To reduce the risk of attacks vendors routinely deliver security updates (patches) for their devices. The delivery of security updates becomes challenging due to the issue of scalability as the number of devices may grow much quicker than vendors' distribution systems. Previous studies have suggested a permissionless and decentralized blockchain-based network in which nodes can host and deliver security updates, thus the addition of new nodes scales out the network. However, these studies do not provide an incentive for nodes to join the network, making it unlikely for nodes to freely contribute their hosting space, bandwidth, and computation resources. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized IoT software update delivery network in which participating nodes referred to as distributors) are compensated by vendors with digital currency for delivering updates to devices. Upon the release of a new security update, a vendor will make a commitment to provide digital currency to distributors that deliver the update; the commitment will be made with the use of smart contracts, and hence will be public, binding, and irreversible. The smart contract promises compensation to any distributor that provides proof-of-distribution, which is unforgeable proof that a single update was delivered to a single device. A distributor acquires the proof-of-distribution by exchanging a security update for a device signature using the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) trustless data exchange protocol. Eliminating the need for trust between the security update distributor and the security consumer (IoT device) by providing fair compensation, can significantly increase the number of distributors, thus facilitating rapid scale out.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) field has gained much attention from industry and academia, being the main subject for numerous research and development projects. Frequently, the dense amount of generated data from IoT applications is sent to a cloud service, that is responsible for processing and storage. Many of these applications demand security and privacy for their data because of their sensitive nature. This is specially true when such data must be processed in entities hosted in public clouds, where the environment in which applications run may not be trusted. Some concerns are then raised since it is not trivial to provide the needed protection for these sensitive data. We present a solution that considers the security components of FIWARE and the Intel SGX capabilities. FIWARE is a platform created to support the development of Smart Applications, including IoT systems, and SGX is the Intel solution for Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). We propose a new component for key management that, together with other FIWARE components, can be used to provide privacy, confidentiality, and integrity guarantees for IoT data. A case study illustrates how this proposed solution can be employed in a realistic scenario, which allows the dissemination of sensitive data through public clouds without risking privacy issues. The results of the experiments provide evidence that our approach does not harm scalability or availability of the system. In addition, it presents acceptable memory costs when considering the benefit of the privacy guarantees achieved.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider positioning with observed-time-difference-of-arrival (OTDOA) for a device deployed in long-term-evolution (LTE) based narrow-band Internet-of-things (NB-IoT) systems. We propose an iterative expectation-maximization based successive interference cancellation (EM-SIC) algorithm to jointly consider estimations of residual frequency-offset (FO), fading-channel taps and time-of-arrival (ToA) of the first arrival-path for each of the detected cells. In order to design a low complexity ToA detector and also due to the limits of low-cost analog circuits, we assume an NB-IoT device working at a low-sampling rate such as 1.92 MHz or lower. The proposed EM-SIC algorithm comprises two stages to detect ToA, based on which OTDOA can be calculated. In a first stage, after running the EM-SIC block a predefined number of iterations, a coarse ToA is estimated for each of the detected cells. Then in a second stage, to improve the ToA resolution, a low-pass filter is utilized to interpolate the correlations of time-domain PRS signal evaluated at a low sampling-rate to a high sampling-rate such as 30.72 MHz. To keep low-complexity, only the correlations inside a small search window centered at the coarse ToA estimates are upsampled. Then, the refined ToAs are estimated based on upsampled correlations. If at least three cells are detected, with OTDOA and the locations of detected cell sites, the position of the NB-IoT device can be estimated. We show through numerical simulations that, the proposed EM-SIC based ToA detector is robust against impairments introduced by inter-cell interference, fading-channel and residual FO. Thus significant signal-to-noise (SNR) gains are obtained over traditional ToA detectors that do not consider these impairments when positioning a device.",

In connection with this, it has become the responsibility of the government to ensure a quality standard of living in the cities and also make sure that these facilities trickle down to the next generation. A program named Smart City Mission has been started for this purpose. With an extremely diverse population, that is only second to China in the world in terms of size, the Indian government has engaged in serious thinking for a better city planning and providing numerous opportunities for the citizenry. It was, therefore, planned that the Smart City Mission program will be able to provide a highly responsive infrastructure, network security, a good living environment and the like. Internet of things (IoT) application in smart cities turns out to be the most challenging in this phase. The information available in the internet has made accessible to many devices through IoT and it also aware the citizen in many aspects. But with the increasing number of devices and information, it is now becoming increasingly difficult to depend on IoT to manage things in the internet space with a similar degree of ease. As a result, cloud-based technologies have given preferences over the existing one and IoT has been replaced by the newly introduced Cloud of Things (CoT) paradigm. This paper intends to connect different smart city applications for the betterment of city life with the Cloud of Things (CoT). Our proposed smart city architecture is based on Cloud of Things, and the focus is also given to identify the existing as well as the forthcoming challenges for the concerned program of the government. By identifying the difficulties it is expected that the project will be materialized with a great success.",

    "abstract": "In the last years Node.js has emerged as a framework particularly suitable for implementing lightweight IoT applications, thanks to its underlying asynchronous event-driven, non blocking I/O model. However, verifying the correctness of programs with asynchronous nested callbacks is quite difficult, and, hence, runtime monitoring can be a valuable support to tackle such a complex task. Runtime monitoring is a useful software verification technique that complements static analysis and testing, but has not been yet fully explored in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Trace expressions have been successfully employed for runtime monitoring in widespread multiagent system platforms. Recently, their expressive power has been extended to allow parametric specifications on data that can be captured and monitored only at runtime. Furthermore, they can be language and system agnostic, through the notion of event domain and type. This paper investigates the use of parametric trace expressions as a first step towards runtime monitoring of programs developed in Node.js and Node-RED, a flow-based IoT programming tool built on top of Node.js. Runtime verification of such systems is a task that mostly seems to have been overlooked so far in the literature. A prototype implementing the proposed system for Node.js, in order to dynamically check with trace expressions the correct usage of API functions, is presented. The tool exploits the dynamic analysis framework Jalangi for monitoring Node.js programs and allows detection of errors that would be difficult to catch with other techniques. Furthermore, it offers a simple REST interface which can be exploited for runtime verification of Node-RED components, and, more generally, IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "With the growth of commercial aviation over the last few decades there have been many applications designed to improve the efficiency of flight operations as well as safety and security. A number of these applications are based on the gathered data from flights; the data is usually acquired from the various sensors available on the aircraft. There are numerous sensors among the electrical and electronics devices on an aircraft, most of which are essential for the proper functioning of the same. With the sensors being operational throughout the time of movement of the aircraft, a large amount of data is collected during each flight. Normally, most of the gathered data are stored on a storage device on the aircraft, and are analyzed and studied later off-site for research purposes focusing on improving airline operation and efficiently maintaining the same. In certain cases, when there is data transfer during the flight, it is between the aircraft and an air-traffic-control (ATC) tower, which serves as the base station. The aircraft equipped with all these sensors, which can gather and exchange data, form a framework of Internet of things (IoT). Detecting and avoiding any form of turbulence for an aircraft is vital; it adds to the safety of both passengers and aircraft while reducing the operating cost of the airline. Therefore, in this paper, we study techniques to detect and avoid Clear Air Turbulence (CAT), which is a specific type of turbulence, based on the IoT framework of aircraft. We propose algorithms that consider both direct and indirect communication between aircraft within a specific region. Using simulation results, we show that our proposed techniques of direct communication using the IoT framework is faster than conventional techniques involving radio communication via both single ATC tower and multiple ATC towers.",

    "abstract": "Existing audio-only hearing-aids are known to perform poorly in noisy situations where overwhelming noise is present. Next-generation audio-visual (lip-reading driven) hearing-aids stand as a major enabler to realise more intelligible audio. However, high data rate, low latency, low computational complexity, and privacy are some of the major bottlenecks to the successful deployment of such advanced hearing aids. To address these challenges, we envision an integration of 5G Cloud-Radio Access Network, Internet of Things (IoT), and strong privacy algorithms to fully benefit from the possibilities these technologies have to offer. The envisioned 5G IoT enabled secure audio-visual (AV) hearing-aid transmits the encrypted compressed AV information and receives encrypted enhanced reconstructed speech in real-time which fully addresses cybersecurity attacks such as location privacy and eavesdropping. For security implementation, a real-time lightweight AV encryption is utilized. For speech enhancement, the received AV information in the cloud is used to filter noisy audio using both deep learning and analytical acoustic modelling (filtering based approach). To offload the computational complexity and real-time optimization issues, the framework runs deep learning and big data optimization processes in the background on the cloud. Specifically, in this work, three key contributions are reported: (1) 5G IoT enabled secure audio-visual hearing-aid framework that aims to achieve a round-trip latency up to 5ms with 100 Mbps datarate (2) Real-time lightweight audio-visual encryption (3) Lip-reading driven deep learning approach for speech enhancement in the cloud. The critical analysis in terms of both speech enhancement and AV encryption demonstrate the potential of the envisioned technology in acquiring high-quality speech reconstruction and secure mobile AV hearing aid communication.",

    "abstract": "As Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical systems become more ubiquitous and an integral part of our daily lives, it is important that we are able to trust the data aggregate from such systems. However, the interpretation of trustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk tolerance attitude of the concerned application and varying levels of uncertainty associated with the evidence upon which trust models act. Hence, the data integrity scoring mechanisms should have provisions to adapt to varying risk attitudes and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian inference model and a prospect theoretic framework for data integrity scoring that quantify the trustworthiness of data collected from IoT devices in the presence of an adversaries who manipulate the data. We consider an imperfect anomaly monitoring mechanism that monitors the data being sent from each device and classifies the outcome as not compromised, compromised, and cannot be inferred. These outcomes are conceptualized as a multinomial hypothesis of a Bayesian inference model with three parameters which are then used for calculating a utility value on how reliable the aggregate data is. We use a prospect theory inspired approach to quantify this data integrity score and evaluate the trustworthiness of the aggregate data from the IoT framework. Furthermore, we also model the system using the traditionally used expected utility theory and compare the results with that obtained using prospect theory. As decisions are based on how the data is fused, we propose two measuring models: one optimistic and another conservative. The proposed framework is validated using extensive simulation experiments. We show how data integrity scores vary under a variety of system factors like attack intensity and inaccurate detection.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a real-time Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system is considered in which the IoT devices are scheduled to sample underlying physical processes and send the status updates to a common destination. In a real-world IoT, due to the possibly different dynamics of each physical process, the sizes of the status updates for different devices are often different and each status update typically requires multiple transmission slots. By taking into account such multi-time slot transmissions with non-uniform sizes of the status updates under noisy channels, the problem of joint device scheduling and status sampling is studied in order to minimize the average age of information (AoI) at the destination. This stochastic problem is formulated as an infinite horizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP). The monotonicity of the value function of the MDP is characterized and then used to show that the optimal scheduling and sampling policy is threshold-based with respect to the AoI at each device. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, a low-complexity suboptimal policy is proposed through a semi-randomized base policy and linear approximated value functions. The proposed suboptimal policy is shown to exhibit a similar structure to the optimal policy, which provides a structural base for its effective performance. A structure-aware algorithm is then developed to obtain the suboptimal policy. The analytical results are further extended to the IoT monitoring system with random status update arrivals, for which, the optimal scheduling and sampling policy is also shown to be threshold-based with the AoI at each device. Simulation results illustrate the structures of the optimal policy and show a near-optimal AoI performance resulting from the proposed suboptimal solution approach.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning motivate the use of deep neural networks in Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. These networks are modelled after signal processing in the human brain, thereby leading to significant advantages at perceptual tasks such as vision and speech recognition. IoT applications, however, often measure physical phenomena, where the underlying physics (such as inertia, wireless signal propagation, or the natural frequency of oscillation) are fundamentally a function of signal frequencies, offering better features in the frequency domain. This observation leads to a fundamental question: For IoT applications, can one develop a new brand of neural network structures that synthesize features inspired not only by the biology of human perception but also by the fundamental nature of physics? Hence, in this paper, instead of using conventional building blocks (e.g., convolutional and recurrent layers), we propose a new foundational neural network building block, the Short-Time Fourier Neural Network (STFNet). It integrates a widely-used time-frequency analysis method, the Short-Time Fourier Transform, into data processing to learn features directly in the frequency domain, where the physics of underlying phenomena leave better foot-prints. STFNets bring additional flexibility to time-frequency analysis by offering novel nonlinear learnable operations that are spectral-compatible. Moreover, STFNets show that transforming signals to a domain that is more connected to the underlying physics greatly simplifies the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STFNets with extensive experiments. STFNets significantly outperform the state-of-the-art deep learning models in all experiments. A STFNet, therefore, demonstrates superior capability as the fundamental building block of deep neural networks for IoT applications for various sensor inputs.",

    "abstract": "Heavy data load and wide cover range have always been crucial problems for online data processing in internet of things (IoT). Recently, mobile-edge computing (MEC) and unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) have emerged as promising techniques in IoT. In this paper, we propose a three-layer online data processing network based on MEC technique. On the bottom layer, raw data are generated by widely distributed sensors, which reflects local information. Upon them, unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) are deployed as moving MEC servers, which collect data and conduct initial steps of data processing. On top of them, a center cloud receives processed results and conducts further evaluation. As this is an online data processing system, the edge nodes should stabilize delay to ensure data freshness. Furthermore, limited onboard energy poses constraints to edge processing capability. To smartly manage network resources for saving energy and stabilizing delay, we develop an online determination policy based on Lyapunov Optimization. In cases of low data rate, it tends to reduce edge processor frequency for saving energy. In the presence of high data rate, it will smartly allocate bandwidth for edge data offloading. Meanwhile, hovering UAV-BSs bring a large and flexible service coverage, which results in the problem of effective path planning. In this paper, we apply deep reinforcement learning and develop an online path planning algorithm. Taking observations of around environment as input, a CNN network is trained to predict the reward of each action. By simulations, we validate its effectiveness in enhancing service coverage. The result will contribute to big data processing in future IoT.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of modern voice controlled devices (VCDs) in recent years has revolutionized the Internet of Things, and resulted in increased realization of smart homes, personalization and home automation through voice commands. The introduction of VCDs in IoT is expected to give emergence of new subfield of IoT, called Multimedia of Thing (MoT). These VCDs can be exploited in IoT driven environment to generate various spoofing attacks including the replays. Replay attacks are generated through replaying the recorded audio of legitimate human speaker with the intent of deceiving the VCDs having speaker verification system. The connectivity among the VCDs can easily be exploited in IoT driven environment to generate a chain of replay attacks (multi-order replay attacks). Existing spoofing detection datasets like ASVspoof and ReMASC contain only the first-order replay recordings against the bonafide audio samples. These datasets can not offer evaluation of the anti-spoofing algorithms capable of detecting the multi-order replay attacks. Additionally, these datasets do not capture the characteristics of microphone arrays, which is an important characteristic of modern VCDs. We need a diverse replay spoofing detection corpus that consists of multi-order replay recordings against the bonafide voice samples. This paper presents a novel voice spoofing detection corpus (VSDC) to evaluate the performance of multi-order replay anti-spoofing methods. The proposed VSDC consists of first and second-order-replay samples against the bonafide audio recordings. Additionally, the proposed VSDC can also be used to evaluate the performance of speaker verification systems as our corpus includes the audio samples of fifteen different speakers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available replay spoofing detection corpus comprising of first-order and second-order-replay samples.",

    "abstract": "Crowd mobility has been paid attention for the Internet-of-things (IoT) applications. This paper addresses the crowd estimation problem and builds an IoT service to share the crowd estimation results across different systems. The crowd estimation problem is to approximate the crowd size in a targeted area using the observed information (e.g., Wi-Fi data). This paper exploits Wi-Fi probe request packets (\"Wi-Fi probes\" for short) broadcasted by mobile devices to solve this problem. However, using only Wi-Fi probes to estimate the crowd size may result in inaccurate results due to various environmental uncertainties which may lead to crowd overestimation or underestimation. Moreover, the ground-truth is unavailable because the coverage of Wi-Fi signals is time-varying and invisible. This paper introduces auxiliary sensors, stereoscopic cameras, to collect the near ground-truth at a specified calibration choke point. Two calibration algorithms are proposed to solve the crowd estimation problem. The key idea is to calibrate the Wi-Fi-only crowd estimation based on the correlations between the two types of data modalities. Then, to share the calibrated results across systems required by different stakeholders, our system is integrated with the FIWARE-based IoT platform. To verify the proposed system, we have launched an indoor pilot study in the Wellington Railway Station and an outdoor pilot study in the Christchurch Re:START Mall in New Zealand. The large-scale pilot studies show that stereoscopic cameras can reach minimum accuracy of 85\\% and high precision detection for providing the near ground-truth. The proposed calibration algorithms reduce estimation errors by 43.68% on average compared to the Wi-Fi-only approach.",

    "abstract": "The smooth operation of largely deployed Internet of Things (IoT) applications will depend on, among other things, effective infrastructure failure detection. Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called \"sleeping cells\", which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rate (FPR) under 5 %. The proposed framework holds potential for other pattern recognition tasks in smart-city wireless infrastructures, that would enable the monitoring, prediction and improvement of the Quality of Service (QoS) experienced by IoT applications.",

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 is the latest industrial revolution primarily merging automation with advanced manufacturing to reduce direct human effort and resources. Predictive maintenance (PdM) is an industry 4.0 solution, which facilitates predicting faults in a component or a system powered by state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors. However, IoT sensors and deep learning (DL) algorithms, both are known for their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks. In the context of PdM systems, such attacks can have catastrophic consequences as they are hard to detect due to the nature of the attack. To date, the majority of the published literature focuses on the accuracy of DL enabled PdM systems and often ignores the effect of such attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate the effect of IoT sensor attacks on a PdM system. At first, we use three state-of-the-art DL algorithms, specifically, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a turbofan engine using NASA's C-MAPSS dataset. The obtained results show that the GRU-based PdM model outperforms some of the recent literature on RUL prediction using the C-MAPSS dataset. Afterward, we model two different types of false data injection attacks (FDIA) on turbofan engine sensor data and evaluate their impact on CNN, LSTM, and GRU-based PdM systems. The obtained results demonstrate that FDI attacks on even a few IoT sensors can strongly defect the RUL prediction. However, the GRU-based PdM model performs better in terms of accuracy and resiliency. Lastly, we perform a study on the GRU-based PdM model using four different GRU networks with different sequence lengths. Our experiments reveal an interesting relationship between the accuracy, resiliency and sequence length for the GRU-based PdM models.",

But REST does not make it possible to inject artificial intelligence into connected objects, ie it cannot allow autonomy and decision-making by the objects themselves. To define an intelligence to a connected object, one can use a Beleive Desire Intention agent (BDI an intelligent agent that adopts human behavior) such as Jason Agentspeak. But Jason AgentSpeak does not guarantee orchestration or choreography between connected objects. There are platforms for service orchestration and choreography in IoT, still the interconnection with artificial intelligence needs to be built. In this article, we propose a new approach called Jason-RS. It is a result of pairing Jason BDI agent with the web service technologies to exploit the agent capacity as a service, Jason-RS turn in Java SE and it does not need any middleware. The architecture that we propose allows to create the link between Artificial Intelligence and Services choreography to reduce human intervention in the service choreography. In order to validate the proposed approach, we have interconnected the Iot BeC 3 platform and the REST agent (Jason-RS). The decision-making faculty offered by Jason-RS is derived from the information sent by the objects according to the different methods of REST (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) that Jason-RS offers. As a result, the objects feed the inter-agent collaborations and decision-making inside the agent. Finally, we show that Jason-RS allows the Web of Objects to power complex systems such as an artificial intelligence responsible for processing data. This performance is promising.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers a cognitive radio-based IoT monitoring system, consisting of an IoT device that aims to update its measurement to a destination using cognitive radio technique. Specifically, the IoT device as a secondary user (SIoT), seeks and exploits the spectrum opportunities of the licensed band vacated by its primary user (PU) to deliver status updates without causing visible effects to the licensed operation. In this context, the SIoT should carefully make use of the licensed band and schedule when to transmit to maintain the timeliness of the status update. We adopt a recent metric, Age of Information (AoI), to characterize the timeliness of the status update of the SIoT. We aim to minimize the long-term average AoI of the SIoT while satisfying the collision constraint imposed by the PU by formulating a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem. We first prove the existence of optimal stationary policy of the CMDP problem. The optimal stationary policy (termed age-optimal policy) is shown to be a randomized simple policy that randomizes between two deterministic policies with a fixed probability. We prove that the two deterministic policies have a threshold structure and further derive the closed-form expression of average AoI and collision probability for the deterministic threshold-structured policy by conducting Markov Chain analysis. The analytical expression offers an efficient way to calculate the threshold and randomization probability to form the age-optimal policy. For comparison, we also consider the throughput maximization policy (termed throughput-optimal policy) and analyze the average AoI performance under the throughput-optimal policy in the considered system. Numerical simulations show the superiority of the derived age-optimal policy over the throughput-optimal policy. We also unveil the impacts of various system parameters on the corresponding optimal policy and the resultant average AoI.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing, despite its inherent advantages (e.g., resource efficiency) still faces several challenges. the wide are network used to connect the cloud to end-users could cause high latency, which may not be tolerable for some applications, especially Internet of Things (IoT applications. Fog computing can reduce this latency by extending the traditional cloud architecture to the edge of the network and by enabling the deployment of some application components on fog nodes. Application providers use Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) to provision (i.e., develop, deploy, manage, and orchestrate) applications in cloud. However, existing PaaS solutions (including IoT PaaS) usually focus on cloud and do not enable provisioning of applications with components spanning cloud and fog. provisioning such applications require novel functions, such as application graph generation, that are absent from existing PaaS. Furthermore, several functions offered by existing PaaS (e.g., publication/discovery) need to be significantly extended in order to fit in a hybrid cloud/fog environment. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for PaaS for hybrid cloud/fog system. It is IoT use case-driven, and its applications' components are implemented as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) with execution sequences modeled s graphs with sub-structures such as selection and loops. It automates the provisioning of applications with components spanning cloud and fog. In addition, it enables the discovery of existing cloud and fog nodes and generates application graphs. A proof of concept is built based on Cloudify open source. Feasibility is demonstrated by evaluating its performance when PaaS modules and application components are placed in clouds and fogs in different geographical locations.",

In this promising scenario, known as the Internet of Things, it is expected that different objects, such as sensors, industrial robots, cars, appliances, will be connected to the Internet. One of the main challenges of the Internet of Things is the interoperability of highly heterogeneous devices, mainly in terms of the communication capabilities and network protocols used. As consequence, the interconnection model of the different devices involves an intermediary device, known as gateway. This gateway is a centralized element for the management of the devices that make up an IoT application. In addition, it is essential for the transmission of information to the Internet, especially when many IoT devices are not IP-based. This paper describes the implementation of an IoT gateway that allows the exchange of data through different wireless technologies and forwarding of such data to the Internet. The proposed gateway has important advantages such as: supporting for multiprotocol interconnectivity; remote configuration of wireless nodes for sensor and actuators management; a flexible algorithm to translate the data obtained by sensors into a uniform format for transmission to a cloud server; low energy consumption due to efficient data transfer over the MQTT protocol. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed gateway, a proof-of-concept test was implemented. The implemented scenario consists of 2 wireless nodes responsible for sensing environmental variables and transmitting data to the gateway node through different communication protocols. The obtained results show the feasibility for simultaneous data transmission from the remote wireless nodes to the gateway.",

However, to prolong the IoT network's lifetime, the efficient resource allocation algorithm is required, in particular, the energy fairness issue among IoT sensors has been a critical challenge of the WPT system. In this paper, considering energy fairness as the minimum received energy of all energy poverty IoT sensors (EPISs), we allocate orthogonal frequency bands to several EPISs and transfer the RF power on each orthogonal band, using energy beamforming. Based on the energy poverty, we propose orthogonal frequency bands assignment rule, granting the priority to the EPISs with less received energy. We also formulate two transmission power allocation problems, incorporated the nonlinear logarithm-energy harvesting (EH) model. First, the total received power maximization (TRPM) problem is presented and solved by combining the well-known Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with the modified water-filling algorithm. Second, the common received power maximization (CRPM) problem is formulated and the optimal solution is derived using the iterative bisection search method. To apply the bisection search method to the problem, this paper proposes a method of specifying the scope of the solution for the objective function defined by the sum of monotonous functions. In numerical results, assuming the mobility of EPISs by the one-dimensional random walk model, the effectiveness of the mobility of EPISs on the minimum received energy of all EPISs is presented. Finally, the performance of the proposed resource allocation schemes is verified by comparing other resources allocation schemes, such as Round robin and equal power distribution",

It is estimated that the IoT will consist of approximately fifty billion devices by the year 2020. In addition to the sheer numbers, the need for IoT security is exacerbated by the fact that many of the edge devices employ weak to no encryption of the communication link. It has been estimated that almost 70% of IoT devices use no form of encryption. Previous research has suggested the use of Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), a physical layer technique, as a means of augmenting bit-level security mechanism such as encryption. The work presented here integrates a Nelder-Mead based approach for estimating the Rayleigh fading channel coefficients prior to the SEI approach known as RF-DNA fingerprinting. The performance of this estimator is assessed for degrading signal-to-noise ratio and compared with least square and minimum mean squared error channel estimators. Additionally, this work presents classification results using RF-DNA fingerprints that were extracted from received signals that have undergone Rayleigh fading channel correction using Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) equalization. This work also performs radio discrimination using RF-DNA fingerprints generated from the normalized magnitude-squared and phase response of Gabor coefficients as well as two classifiers. Discrimination of four 802.11a Wi-Fi radios achieves an average percent correct classification of 90% or better for signal-to-noise ratios of 18 and 21 dB or greater using a Rayleigh fading channel comprised of two and five paths, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a dense Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system is considered in which a large number of IoT devices contend for channel access so as to transmit timely status updates to the corresponding receivers using a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) scheme. Under two packet management schemes with and without preemption in service, the closed-form expressions of the average age of information (AoI) and the average peak AoI of each device is characterized. It is shown that the scheme with preemption in service always leads to a smaller average AoI and a smaller average peak AoI, compared to the scheme without preemption in service. Then, a distributed noncooperative medium access control game is formulated in which each device optimizes its waiting rate so as to minimize its average AoI or average peak AoI under an average energy cost constraint on channel sensing and packet transmitting. To overcome the challenges of solving this game for an ultra-dense IoT, a mean-field game (MFG) approach is proposed to study the asymptotic performance of each device for the system in the large population regime. The accuracy of the MFG is analyzed, and the existence, uniqueness, and convergence of the mean-field equilibrium (MFE) are investigated. Simulation results show that the proposed MFG is accurate even for a small number of devices; and the proposed CSMA-type scheme under the MFG analysis outperforms two baseline schemes with fixed and dynamic waiting rates, with the average AoI reductions reaching up to 22% and 34%, respectively. Moreover, it is observed that the average AoI and the average peak AoI under the MFE do not necessarily decrease with the arrival rate.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive computing involves the placement of processing services close to end users to support intelligent applications. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Edge Computing (EC), one can find room for placing services at various points in the interconnection of the aforementioned infrastructures. Of significant importance is the processing of the collected data. Such a processing can be realized upon the EC nodes that exhibit increased computational capabilities compared to IoT devices. An ecosystem of intelligent nodes is created at the EC giving the opportunity to support cooperative models. Nodes become the hosts of geo-distributed datasets formulated by the IoT devices reports. Upon the datasets, a number of queries/tasks can be executed. Queries/tasks can be offloaded for performance reasons. However, an offloading action should be carefully designed being always aligned with the data present to the hosting node. In this paper, we present a model to support the cooperative aspect in the EC infrastructure. We argue on the delivery of data synopses to EC nodes making them capable to take offloading decisions fully aligned with data present at peers. Nodes exchange data synopses to inform their peers. We propose a scheme that detects the appropriate time to distribute synopses trying to avoid the network overloading especially when synopses are frequently extracted due to the high rates at which IoT devices report data to EC nodes. Our approach involves a Deep Learning model for learning the distribution of calculated synopses and estimate future trends. Upon these trends, we are able to find the appropriate time to deliver synopses to peer nodes. We provide the description of the proposed mechanism and evaluate it based on real datasets. An extensive experimentation upon various scenarios reveals the pros and cons of the approach by giving numerical results.",

    "abstract": "Edge learning (EL), which uses edge computing as a platform to execute machine learning algorithms, is able to fully exploit the massive sensing data generated by Internet of Things (IoT). However, due to the limited transmit power at IoT devices, collecting the sensing data in EL systems is a challenging task. To address this challenge, this paper proposes to integrate unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with EL. With such a scheme, the UGV could improve the communication quality by approaching various IoT devices. However, different devices may transmit different data for different machine learning jobs and a fundamental question is how to jointly plan the UGV path, the devices' energy consumption, and the number of samples for different jobs? This paper further proposes a graph-based path planning model, a network energy consumption model and a sample size planning model that characterizes F-measure as a function of the minority class sample size. With these models, the joint path, energy and sample size planning (JPESP) problem is formulated as a large-scale mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is nontrivial to solve due to the high-dimensional discontinuous variables related to UGV movement. To this end, it is proved that each IoT device should be served only once along the path, thus the problem dimension is significantly reduced. Furthermore, to handle the discontinuous variables, a tabu search (TS) based algorithm is derived, which converges in expectation to the optimal solution to the JPESP problem. Simulation results under different task scenarios show that our optimization schemes outperform the fixed EL and the full path EL schemes.",

    "abstract": "Condominium network refers to intra-organization networks, where smart buildings or apartments are connected and share resources over the network. Secured communication platform or channel has been highlighted as a key requirement for a reliable condominium which can be ensured by the utilization of the advanced techniques and platforms like Software-Defined Network (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Blockchain (BC). These technologies provide a robust, and secured platform to meet all kinds of challenges, such as safety, confidentiality, flexibility, efficiency, and availability. This work suggests a distributed, scalable IoT-SDN with Blockchain-based NFV framework for a smart condominium (DistB-Condo) that can act as an efficient secured platform for a small community. Moreover, the Blockchain-based IoT-SDN with NFV framework provides the combined benefits of leading technologies. It also presents an optimized Cluster Head Selection (CHS) algorithm for selecting a Cluster Head (CH) among the clusters that efficiently saves energy. Besides, a decentralized and secured Blockchain approach has been introduced that allows more prominent security and privacy to the desired condominium network. Our proposed approach has also the ability to detect attacks in an IoT environment. Eventually, this article evaluates the performance of the proposed architecture using different parameters (e.g., throughput, packet arrival rate, and response time). The proposed approach outperforms the existing OF-Based SDN. DistB-Condo has better throughput on average, and the bandwidth (Mbps) much higher than the OF-Based SDN approach in the presence of attacks. Also, the proposed model has an average response time of 5% less than the core model.",

    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are increasingly being deployed across multiple functionalities, ranging from healthcare devices and wearables to critical infrastructures, e.g., nuclear power plants, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and smart homes. These devices are inherently not secure across their comprehensive software, hardware, and network stacks, thus presenting a large attack surface that can be exploited by hackers. In this article, we present an innovative technique for detecting unknown system vulnerabilities, managing these vulnerabilities, and improving incident response when such vulnerabilities are exploited. The novelty of this approach lies in extracting intelligence from known real-world CPS/IoT attacks, representing them in the form of regular expressions, and employing machine learning (ML) techniques on this ensemble of regular expressions to generate new attack vectors and security vulnerabilities. Our results show that 10 new attack vectors and 122 new vulnerability exploits can be successfully generated that have the potential to exploit a CPS or an IoT ecosystem. The ML methodology achieves an accuracy of 97.4% and enables us to predict these attacks efficiently with an 87.2% reduction in the search space. We demonstrate the application of our method to the hacking of the in-vehicle network of a connected car. To defend against the known attacks and possible novel exploits, we discuss a defense-in-depth mechanism for various classes of attacks and the classification of data targeted by such attacks. This defense mechanism optimizes the cost of security measures based on the sensitivity of the protected resource, thus incentivizing its adoption in real-world CPS/IoT by cybersecurity practitioners.",

To address this problem, we propose a variant of flooding, called Level-Based Flooding (LBF). With LBF, the whole network is divided into several levels according to the distances (i.e., hops) between the sensor nodes and the sink node. The sink node knows the level information of each node. Query packets are broadcast in the network according to the levels of nodes. Upon receiving a query packet, sensor nodes decide how to process it according to the percentage of neighbors that have processed it. When the target node receives the query packet, it sends its data back to the sink node via random walk. We show by extensive simulations that the performance of LBF in terms of cost and latency is much better than that of original flooding, and LBF can be used in IoT of different scales.",

The major challenge hereby is to cope with the highly asynchronous access of different devices and to allow transmission of control signaling and payload \"in one shot\". We address this challenge by using a waveform design approach based on bi-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing where transmit orthogonality is replaced in favor of better temporal and spectral properties. We show that this approach allows data transmission in frequencies that otherwise have to remain unused. More precisely, we utilize frequencies previously used as guard bands, located towards the standard synchronous communication pipes as well as in between the typically small amount of resources used by each IoT device. We demonstrate the superiority of this waveform approach over the conventional random access using a novel mathematical approach and numerical experiments.",

The tremendous growth in the number and type of wirelessly connected devices in a combination with the dropping cost for performing cyberattacks create new challenges for assuring security of services and applications provided by the next generation of wireless communication networks. The situation is complicated even further by the fact that many end-point Internet of Things (IoT) devices have very limited resources for implementing security functionality. This paper addresses one of the aspects of this important, many-faceted problem - the design of hardware-efficient cryptographic primitives suitable for the protection of resource-constrained IoT devices. We focus on cryptographic primitives based on the invertible mappings of type $\\{0,1,\\ldots,2^n-1\\} \\rightarrow \\{0,1,\\ldots,2^n-1\\}$. In order to check if a given mapping is invertible or not, we generally need an exponential in $n$ number of steps. In this paper, we derive a sufficient condition for invertibility which can be checked in $O(n^2 N)$ time, where $N$ is the size of representation of the largest function in the mapping. Our results can be used for constructing cryptographically secure invertible mappings which can be efficiently implemented in hardware.",

In this paper, a novel pixelated VLC backscatter is proposed and implemented to overcome the channel capacity limitation. In particular, multiple smaller VLC backscatters, switching on or off, are integrated to generate multi-level signals, which enables the usage of more advanced modulation schemes than OOK. Based on experimental results, rate adaptation at different communication distances can be employed to enhance the achievable data rate. Compared to OOK, the data rate can be tripled when 8-PAM is used at 2 meters. In general, $n$-fold throughput enhancement is realized by utilizing $n$ smaller VLC backscatters while incurring negligible additional energy using the same device space as that of a single large backscatter.",

The use of a virtualization middleware is expected to enrich the capabilities and opportunities related to the use of smart grid devices. In this paper, we propose key features for an interoperable, re-usable, elastic and secure smart grid architecture which is cloud-based and relies on REST APIs. To highlight the benefits, a practical case study is presented, where outlined functionalities are implemented in a cloud-based IoT platform. The advantages brought by the proposed middleware in terms of interoperability, re-usability, privacy and elasticity of the underlying infrastructure are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the number of devices has grown increasingly and it is hoped that, between 2015 and 2016, 20 billion devices will be connected to the Internet and this market will move around 91.5 billion dollars. The Internet of Things (IoT) is composed of small sensors and actuators embedded in objects with Internet access and will play a key role in solving many challenges faced in today's society. However, the real capacity of IoT concepts is constrained as the current sensor networks usually do not exchange information with other sources. In this paper, we propose the Visual Search for Internet of Things (ViSIoT) platform to help technical and non-technical users to discover and use sensors as a service for different application purposes. As a proof of concept, a real case study is used to generate weather condition reports to support rheumatism patients. This case study was executed in a working prototype and a performance evaluation is presented.",

    "abstract": "Solid-state memory is an essential component of the digital age. With advancements in healthcare technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for ultra-dense, ultra-low-power memory is increasing. In this review, we present a comprehensive perspective on the most notable approaches to the fabrication of physically flexible memory devices. With the future goal of replacing traditional mechanical hard disks with solid-state storage devices, a fully flexible electronic system will need two basic devices: transistors and nonvolatile memory. Transistors are used for logic operations and gating memory arrays, while nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices are required for storing information in the main memory and cache storage. Since the highest density of transistors and storage structures is manifested in memories, the focus of this review is flexible NVM. Flexible NVM components are discussed in terms of their functionality, performance metrics, and reliability aspects, all of which are critical components for NVM technology to be part of mainstream consumer electronics, IoT, and advanced healthcare devices. Finally, flexible NVMs are benchmarked and future prospects are provided.",

The major contributions of the paper are the following: we demonstrate that a cloud-based architecture is capable of achieving the QoS level required by the specific state estimation application; we show that implementing a certain local logic for data transmission in the cloud, the result of the state estimation is not degraded with respect to the case of an estimation that takes place frequently at fixed intervals; we show the results in terms of latency and reduced network load for a reference smart grid network.",

The proposed solution, referred to as multi-service oriented multiple access (MOMA), is based on a) establishing separate classes of users using relevant criteria that go beyond the simple handheld-IoT device split, b) service-dependent hierarchical spreading of the data signals and c) a mix of multiuser and single-user detection schemes at the receiver. Signal spreading in MOMA allows to handle densely connected devices with different quality-of-service (QoS) profiles and at the same time its flexible receiver structure allows to allocate the receiver computational resources to the connections that need it most. This yields a scalable and efficient use of the available radio resources and a better service integration. While providing significant advantages for key future communications scenarios, MOMA can be incorporated into LTE with a limited impact on the protocol structure and the signaling overhead.",

An attack detection mechanism that understands the limitations of these severely resource-constrained devices is necessary. This is important since current approaches are either customized for wireless networks or for the conventional Internet with heavy data transmission. Also, the detection mechanism need not always be as sophisticated. Simply signaling that an attack is taking place may be enough in some situations, for example in NIDS using anomaly detection. In graph networks, central nodes are the nodes that bear the most influence in the network. The purpose of this research is to explore experimentally the relationship between the behavior of central nodes and anomaly detection when an attack spreads through a network. As a result, we propose a novel anomaly detection approach using this unique methodology which has been unexplored so far in communication networks. Also, in the experiment, we identify presence of an attack originating and propagating throughout a network of IoT using our methodology.",

In this paper we are proposing to take advantage of the Internet of Things (IoT) phenomena. In IoT environment a user may have multiple interconnected in-home low-end devices with publicly accessible address. In this architecture we move the email application from the central service into user's in-home and mobile devices, store complete email history on each device, and replace legacy IMAP and SMTP protocols with a synchronization protocol found in Distributed Version Control Systems(DVCS). This addresses the email reconciliation issue, optimizes the bandwidth usage, and intrinsically puts the user in control of her data.

While these changes enhance sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant management challenges as the complexity of power systems increases. To tackle these challenges, decentralized Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. Within a transactive microgrid, \"prosumers\" (i.e., consumers with energy generation and storage capabilities) can trade energy with each other, thereby smoothing the load on the main grid using local supply. It is hard, however, to provide security, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system. On the one hand, prosumers' personal information must be protected from their trade partners and the system operator. On the other hand, the system must be protected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize the entire grid. This paper describes Privacy-preserving Energy Transactions (PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that enables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy. PETra builds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and provides anonymity for communication, bidding, and trading.",

Service matching is provided by a network function designed using principles from Information-Centric Networks (ICN) research, routing edge requests directly to the nearest service points without expensive and slow DNS redirects. The proposed Fog substrate reduces the networking complexity and overhead while being architecturally simple. We evaluate the architecture through a comparison with how Fog might be established over existing networking fabrics and quantify the performance benefits. Evaluation results illustrate the superiority of the proposed architecture in reducing the required backhaul capacity and the path length.",

These environments generally consist of tools from different vendors and are not necessarily integrated well with each other. In order to automate various analyses, queries across resources from multiple tools have to be executed in parallel to the engineering activities. In this paper, we identify the necessary requirements on such a query capability and evaluate different architectures according to these requirements. We propose an improved lifecycle query architecture, which builds upon the existing Tracked Resource Set (TRS) protocol, and complements it with the MQTT messaging protocol in order to allow the data in the warehouse to be kept updated in real-time. As part of the case study focusing on the development of an IoT automated warehouse, this architecture was implemented for a toolchain integrated using RESTful microservices and linked data.",

In the context of IoT scenarios where the same information from a sensor is used by multiple applications at different locations, the data stream needs to be replicated. However, the transportation of parallel streams might not be feasible due to limitations in the capacity of the network transporting the data. To address this issue, a content and computation-aware communication control framework is proposed based on the Software Defined Network (SDN) paradigm. The framework supports multi-streaming using the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), where the traffic flow and packet replication for each specific computation process is controlled by a program running inside an in-kernel Virtual Ma- chine (VM). The proposed framework is instantiated to address a case-study scenario where video streams from multiple cameras are transmitted to the edge processor for real-time analysis. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed framework in terms of programmability, network bandwidth and system resource savings.",

To address this, blind spatial combining and its incorporation in the data-only MUD are elaborated in this paper answering to both the academic and industry's concern in the overloading potential of autonomous grant-free (AGF) transmission.

    "abstract": "The collision resolution mechanism in the Random Access Channel (RACH) procedure of the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standard is known to represent a serious bottleneck in case of machine-type traffic. Its main drawbacks are seen in the facts that Base Stations (eNBs) typically cannot infer the number of collided User Equipments (UEs) and that collided UEs learn about the collision only implicitly, through the lack of the feedback in the later stage of the RACH procedure. The collided UEs then restart the procedure, thereby increasing the RACH load and making the system more prone to collisions. In this paper, we leverage machine learning techniques to design a system that outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes in preamble detection for the LTE RACH procedure. Most importantly, our scheme can also estimate the collision multiplicity, and thus gather information about how many devices chose the same preamble. This data can be used by the eNB to resolve collisions, increase the supported system load and reduce transmission latency. The presented approach is applicable to novel 3GPP standards that target massive IoT, e.g., LTE-M and NB-IoT.",

    "abstract": "Low-power ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) relying on radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting is an energy-efficient solution for batteryless Internet of things (IoT). However, ambient backscatter signals are severely faded by dyadic backscatter channel (DBC), limiting connectivity in conventional orthogonal time-division-based AmBC (TD-AmBC). In order to support massive connectivity in AmBC, we propose sparse-coded AmBC (SC-AmBC) based on non-orthogonal signaling. Sparse code utilizes inherent sparsity of AmBC where power supplies of RF tags rely on ambient RF energy harvesting. Consequently, sparse-coded backscatter modulation algorithm (SC-BMA) can enable non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as well as M-ary modulation for concurrent backscatter transmissions, providing additional diversity gain. These sparse codewords from multiple tags can be efficiently detected at access point (AP) using iterative message passing algorithm (MPA). To overcome DBC along with intersymbol interference (ISI), we propose dyadic channel estimation algorithm (D-CEA) and dyadic MPA (D-MPA) exploiting weighted-sum of the ISI for information exchange in factor graph. Simulation results validate the potential of the SC-AmBC in terms of connectivity, detection performance and sum throughput.",

Since different activities accumulate energies in the capacitor at different rates, these activities can be detected directly by observing the charging rate of the capacitor. The key advantage of the proposed capacitor based activity sensing mechanism, called CapSense, is that it obviates the need for sampling the motion signal during the activity detection period thus significantly saving power consumption of the wearable device. A challenge we face is that capacitors are inherently non-linear energy accumulators, which, even for the same activity, leads to significant variations in charging rates at different times depending on the current charge level of the capacitor. We solve this problem by jointly configuring the parameters of the capacitor and the associated energy harvesting circuits, which allows us to operate on charging cycles that are approximately linear. We design and implement a kinetic-powered shoe sole and conduct experiments with 10 subjects. Our results show that CapSense can classify five different daily activities with 95% accuracy while consuming 73% less system power compared to conventional motion signal based activity detection.",

    "abstract": "Many IoT applications make extensive use of constrained devices which are characterized by unexpected failures. In addition, nodes could be put offline temporarily for maintenance (e.g. battery replacement). These incidents lead to loss of dynamic data that is generated due to the interactions between nodes. For instance, configuration settings adjusted by sending PUT request to the sensor will be lost when the node is rebooted. The lost data, which we call dynamic states, leads to erroneous results or malfunctions of the IoT application. In this paper, we introduce an intelligent dynamic state recovery mechanism through deep packet inspection. A State Directory, placed at the gateway, intercepts every communication between an external device and constrained devices and stores (or updates) information that is important to restore dynamic states. When a node reports a reboot, the state directory replays the packets that generated the dynamic state so that all dynamic states are restored. We implemented the solution on a non-constrained device that acts as a gateway to the constrained network and tested the results using Cooja simulator.",

Such decisions allow communicating VMs to follow a flocking-like behavior that consists of three simple rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion. Using game theory, we derive analytical bounds on Flock's Price of Anarchy (PoA), and prove that flocking VMs converge to a Nash Equilibrium while settling in the best possible cloud platforms. We verify the effectiveness of Flock through simulations and discuss how its generic objective can simply be tweaked to achieve other objectives, such as cloud load balancing and energy consumption minimization.",

The standard specifies Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying Physical Layer (O-QPSK PHY) with half-sine pulse shaping which can be either analyzed under the class of M-ary PSK signals (QPSK signal with offset) or as Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) signal. M-ary PSK demodulation is requires perfect carrier and has minimal error. MSK signals which falls under Continuous Phase Frequency Shift Keying can be demodulated non-coherently but error performance is not as good. In our paper, this dual nature of IEEE 802.15.4 PHY is exploited to propose a dual mode receiver comprising of QPSK demodulator chain and MSK demodulator chain as a single system on chip. The mode can be configured manually depending on the type of application or based on the feedback from a Signal to Noise (SNR) indicator employed in the proposed receiver. M-ary PSK chain is selected for lower SNRs and MSK for higher SNRs. Each of these properties are analyzed in detail for both demodulator chains and we go on to prove that MSK detection can be used for low power, low complex and low latency while QPSK detection is employed for minimal error.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the utilization of TV White Spaces (TVWS) by small Cognitive Radio (CR) wireless network operators (SCWNO) to support the communication needs of various smart grid and internet of things (IoT) applications. Spectrum leasing could be essential for SCWNO to support a wide range of applications. In our paper, we assume that in order to ensure Quality of service (QoS) requirements, the CR operator has the option of leasing the specially designated high priority TVWS channels (HPC) for short term use by paying a small fee according to the actual usage. Based on Lyapunov drift plus penalty function framework, we develop an online algorithm to exploit QoS flexibility. Such flexibility might be available in terms of data transmission delays as well as data quality reduction in order to minimize the overall HPC leasing cost. The developed algorithm also provides three adjustable parameters that could be controlled to tradeoff the total cost and QoS. The performance of the proposed algorithm is very close to the optimal offline lower bound solution.",

We highlight novel capabilities of the Edge and Fog layers, such as physical and application mobility, privacy sensitivity, and a nascent runtime environment.

Pipe breakage as one of the most frequent types of failure of water networks often causes community disruptions ranging from temporary interruptions in services to extended loss of business and relocation of residents. In this project, we design and implement a two-phase approach for leak event identification, which leverages dynamic data from multiple information sources including IoT sensing data (pressure values and/or flow rates), geophysical data (water systems), and human inputs (tweets posted on Twitter). In the approach, a high order Conditional Random Field (CRF) is constructed that enforces predictions based on IoT observations consistent with human inputs to improve the performance of event identifications. Considering the physical water network as a graph, a CRF model is built and learned by the Structured Support Vector Machine (SSVM) using node features such as water pressure and flow rate. After that, we built the high order CRF system by enforcing twitter leakage detection information. An optimal inference algorithm is proposed for the adapted high order CRF model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our system.",

Therefore, we propose D-SLATS, a framework comprised of three different and independent algorithms to jointly solve time synchronization and localization problems in a distributed fashion. The First two algorithms are based mainly on the distributed Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) whereas the third one uses optimization techniques. No fusion center is required, and the devices only communicate with their neighbors.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new spectrum sharing model referred to as riding on the primary (ROP) is proposed for wireless-powered IoT devices with ambient backscatter communication capabilities. The key idea of ROP is that the secondary transmitter harvests energy from the primary signal, then modulates its information bits to the primary signal, and reflects the modulated signal to the secondary receiver without violating the primary system's interference requirement. Compared with the conventional spectrum sharing model, the secondary system in the proposed ROP not only utilizes the spectrum of the primary system but also takes advantage of the primary signal to harvest energy and to carry its information. In this paper, we investigate the performance of such a spectrum sharing system under fading channels. To be specific, we maximize the ergodic capacity of the secondary system by jointly optimizing the transmit power of the primary signal and the reflection coefficient of the secondary ambient backscatter. Different (ideal/practical) energy consumption models, different (peak/average) transmit power constraints, different types (fixed/dynamically adjustable) reflection coefficient, different primary system's interference requirements (rate/outage) are considered. Optimal power allocation and reflection coefficient are obtained for each scenario.",

In this paper, we present a multi-methodological system model that brings together testbed experiments for measuring real hardware properties and simulative evaluations for large-scale considerations. As an example case study, we will particularly focus on parametrization of the 802.15.4-based radio communication system, which has to be energy-efficient due to scarce amount of harvested energy, but avoid latencies for the maintenance of scalability of the overlaying warehouse system. The results show, that a modification of the initial backoff time can lead to both, energy and time savings in the order of 50% compared to the standard.",

    "abstract": "The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and its extensions, such as observe and group communication, offer the potential for developing novel IoT applications. However, a full-fledged CoAP-based application requires delay-tolerant communication and support for multicast: since these properties cannot be easily provided by existing IP networks, developers cannot take full advantage of CoAP, preferring to use HTTP instead. In this demo we show how proxying CoAP traffic over an ICN network can unleash the full potential of CoAP, simultaneously shifting overhead and complexity from the (constrained) endpoints to the network.",

    "abstract": "Industrial automation deployments constitute challenging environments where moving IoT machines may produce high-definition video and other heavy sensor data during surveying and inspection operations. Transporting massive contents to the edge network infrastructure and then eventually to the remote human operator requires reliable and high-rate radio links supported by intelligent data caching and delivery mechanisms. In this work, we address the challenges of contents dissemination in characteristic factory automation scenarios by proposing to engage moving industrial machines as device-to-device (D2D) caching helpers. With the goal to improve reliability of high-rate millimeter-wave (mmWave) data connections, we introduce the alternative contents dissemination modes and then construct a novel mobility-aware methodology that helps develop predictive mode selection strategies based on the anticipated radio link conditions. We also conduct a thorough system-level evaluation of representative data dissemination strategies to confirm the benefits of predictive solutions that employ D2D-enabled collaborative caching at the wireless edge to lower contents delivery latency and improve data acquisition reliability.",

    "abstract": "Smart homes have attracted much attention due to the expanding of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and smart devices. In this paper, we propose a smart gateway platform for data collection and awareness in smart home networks. A smart gateway will replace the traditional network gateway to connect the home network and the Internet. A smart home network supports different types of smart devices, such as in home IoT devices, smart phones, smart electric appliances, etc. A traditional network gateway is not capable of providing quality-of-service measurement, user behavioral analytics, or network optimization. Such tasks are traditionally performed with measurement agents such as optical splitters or network probes deployed in the core network. Our proposed platform is a lightweight plug-in for the smart gateway to accomplish data collection, awareness and reporting. While the smart gateway is able to adjust the control policy for data collection and awareness locally, a cloud-based controller is also included for more refined control policy updates. Furthermore, we propose a multi-dimensional awareness framework to achieve accurate data awareness at the smart gateway. The efficiency of data collection and accuracy of data awareness of the proposed platform is demonstrated based on the tests using actual data traffic from a large number of smart home users.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) has received considerable attention because it can extract valuable information from various Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In CIoT, truth discovery plays an important role in identifying truthful values from large scale data to help CIoT provide deeper insights and value from collected information. However, the privacy concerns of IoT devices pose a major challenge in designing truth discovery approaches. Although existing schemes of truth discovery can be executed with strong privacy guarantees, they are not efficient or cannot be applied in real-life CIoT applications. This article proposes a novel framework for lightweight and privacy-preserving truth discovery called LPTD-I, which is implemented by incorporating fog and cloud platforms, and adopting the homomorphic Paillier encryption and one-way hash chain techniques. This scheme not only protects devices' privacy, but also achieves high efficiency. Moreover, we introduce a fault tolerant (LPTD-II) framework which can effectively overcome malfunctioning CIoT devices. Detailed security analysis indicates the proposed schemes are secure under a comprehensively designed threat model. Experimental simulations are also carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes.",

However, without appropriate privacy protection, conducting data analytics becomes a source of a privacy nightmare. In this article, we present the research challenges in developing practical privacy-preserving analytics in healthcare information systems.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of Internet-of-things (IoT) and artificial intelligence applications have called forth a new computing paradigm--edge computing. In this paper, we study the suitability of deploying FPGAs for edge computing from the perspectives of throughput sensitivity to workload size, architectural adaptiveness to algorithm characteristics, and energy efficiency. This goal is accomplished by conducting comparison experiments on an Intel Arria 10 GX1150 FPGA and an Nvidia Tesla K40m GPU. The experiment results imply that the key advantages of adopting FPGAs for edge computing over GPUs are three-fold: 1) FPGAs can provide a consistent throughput invariant to the size of application workload, which is critical to aggregating individual service requests from various IoT sensors; (2) FPGAs offer both spatial and temporal parallelism at a fine granularity and a massive scale, which guarantees a consistently high performance for accelerating both high-concurrency and high-dependency algorithms; and (3) FPGAs feature 3-4 times lower power consumption and up to 30.7 times better energy efficiency, offering better thermal stability and lower energy cost per functionality.",

However, such policies are established as a result of underlying, potentially complex and long-term policy making processes. Consequently, better policies require improved and verifiable planning processes. In order to assess and evaluate the planning process, transparency of the system is pivotal which can be achieved by tracking the provenance of policy making process. However, at present no system is available that can track the complete cycle of urban planning and decision making. We propose to capture the complete process of policy making and to investigate the role of IoT provenance to support design-making for policy analytics and implementation. The environment in which this research will be demonstrated is that of Smart Cities whose requirements will drive the research process.",

Over the past years, many promising solutions have been proposed but they all suffer from the drawback of new infrastructure costs, setup and maintenance, or are difficult to implement due to FCC regulations. In this paper, we propose a novel Wireless Quantization Index Modulation (QIM) technique which uses existing infrastructure to embed information into existing wireless signals to communicate with IoT devices with negligible impact on the original signal and zero spectrum overhead. We explore the design space for wireless QIM and evaluate the performance of embedding information in TV, FM and AM radio broadcast signals under different conditions. We demonstrate that we can embed messages at up to 8-200~kbps with negligible impact on the audio and video quality of the original FM, AM and TV signals respectively.",

    "abstract": "Privacy is a concept found throughout human history and opinion polls suggest that the public value this principle. However, while many individuals claim to care about privacy, they are often perceived to express behaviour to the contrary. This phenomenon is known as the Privacy Paradox and its existence has been validated through numerous psychological, economic and computer science studies. Several contributory factors have been suggested including user interface design, risk salience, social norms and default configurations. We posit that the further proliferation of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) will aggravate many of these factors, posing even greater risks to individuals' privacy. This paper explores the evolution of both the paradox and the IoT, discusses how privacy risk might alter over the coming years, and suggests further research required to address a reasonable balance. We believe both technological and socio-technical measures are necessary to ensure privacy is protected in a world of ubiquitous technology.",

However, in a physical-layer key agreement scheme, non-reciprocity due to inherent channel noise and hardware impairments can propagate bit disagreements. This has to be addressed prior to the symmetric key generation which is inherently important in social Internet of Things (IoT) networks, including in adversarial settings (e.g. battlefields). In this paper, we parametrically incorporate temporal variability attributes, such as three-dimensional (3D) scattering and scatterers mobility. Accordingly, this is the first work to incorporate such features into the key generation process by combining non-reciprocity compensation with turbo codes. Preliminary results indicate a significant improvement when using Turbo Codes in bit mismatch rate (BMR) and key generation rate (KGR) in comparison to sample indexing techniques.",

We exhibit our attack against Simeck32/64 using the Hamming weight leakage assumption to extract linearly independent equations in key bits. We have been able to find 32 linearly independent equations in 32 key variables by only considering the second bit from the LSB of the Hamming weight leakage of the internal state on the fourth round of the cipher. This enables our attack to improve previous attacks on Simeck32/64 within side-channel attack model with better time and data complexity of 2^35 and 2^11.29 respectively.",
